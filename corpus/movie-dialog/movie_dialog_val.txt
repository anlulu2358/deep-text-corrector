i can get into the den . the office is right across the hall .
can you get into the office ?
i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house .
i thought they locked you in your room .
but i might be able to sneak into the office if they 're not around . then i could open the disks here in my room .
dennis wo n't let me go to the desk . he makes me sit on the floor .
i think he was working on them today , so they 're probably in his office . could you find them and see who they belong to ?
he has lots of disks .
your dad has two computer disks . they have funny names : marlon and al .
what do you want me to do ?
i 'm serious , thomas ; i do n't want you to get hurt .

they nailed the windows . i ca n't get 'm open .

yes .
did you find the disks ?
he 's going to kill you . do n't you know that ? he ca n't take the chance that you 'll talk .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
they 're still in the house .
where are my children ?

a delegation .
we , who is we ?
paul , we would like to speak to you in your office .
they 're killing everyone . the lady minister ! the un soldiers . they 're at the gate .
what happened ?
i 'm sorry , it 's a private function .
can you get me into the ambassador 's reception ?
yes , benedict , what can i do ?
paul , paul , a moment please .
i 'll be back .
paul ... ... i have to talk to you .
of course .
also , could you remember to use the service entrance at all times ?
leave it to me .
the hutu-tutsi thing . the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords . and the u.n. wants the banquet room for that day , a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony . can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish ?
excuse me ?
that 's what i came to talk to you about .
no , bik , it 's a code word for tutsis .
cockroaches ?
gregoire , there are no cockroaches in this hotel , do you understand ?
gregoire will deal with it , excuse me .
paul !
you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for captain naramunju .
do n't be foolish . there 's more money to be made here .
i swear , captain , one hundred thousand francs , enough for a house . i will get the money , you keep them outside .
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n .
i do n't have it here . at the mille collines . i can get it for you .
give me it .
i 'll give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them .
and four children ?
ten .
six .
how many in your family ?
here , here , a thousand us dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family . to let us drive off to the mille collines .
i do n't have that much .
ten thousand francs for each one .
name a price .
how much ?
why not ? these are not rebels , look at them . soon they will be worthless to you . why not take some money , for your work ?
you want to pay me ?
there is nothing to it .
please , i do n't use guns .
let me explain .
they are all tutsi cockroaches .
where is your family ?
captain , i must take my family . it is not safe here .
of course .
do you know how to open the safe there ? our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe . you must open it .
i used to work at the diplomat .
no . i work at the mille collines .
you work at the hotel diplomat ?
yes , it is a calamity for us all .
you heard the tutsi cockroaches murdered our president .
let me see your identity card .
what is this about ?
we are looking for you .
i am paul rusesabagina , a good friend of general bizimungu .
who are you ?
we 're awaiting a decision , excuse me .
what was the response ?
yes we have .
have you requested re-enforcements ?
yes . with some re-inforcements i 'm confident we could impose order .
if the un changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed ?
unfortunately we 're here as peace-keepers not peace makers , we ca n't take an aggressive role .
we 've heard reports of reprisal killings . will the un intervene to stop the bloodshed . ?
no . but i fear it 's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels .
do we know who fired the missile that killed the president ?
i wish i could , paul . try to hold out .
give me their uniforms . i will put people at the gate , in disguise .
no , paul , they 're afraid . they 've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now .
i ca n't . i have nothing left to bribe with . can your men at the gate hold out for another day ?
paul , i need you to buy me a day or two . i do n't have the fuel for this convoy . i will have to scrounge it .
the rebels have fought their way into the city . they have many hutu prisoners .
what is it ?
i ca n't , i do n't have the men .
will you protect us .
that explains it . i 'm sorry to tell you this but we 've heard rumors the militia are getting ready to storm the hotel .
i ran out of bribes . bizimungu took them away .
yes . where are the rwandan police ?
they fired a rocket at us .
they 're only taking the whites .
their people ?
you 're fucking black ! you 're not even a nigger , you 're african ! they 're not staying to stop this thing . they 're gon na fly right out of here with their people .
do n't bullshit me , paul . you 're the smartest man here . you have them all eating out of your hand . you 'd own this fucking hotel , except for one thing .
i do n't understand .
we think you are dirt , less than dirt , worthless .
excuse me , colonel .
congratulations . you should spit in my face .
congratulations , colonel . you have saved us all .
canadian club ?
anything . strong .
where is she ?
they murdered my soldiers . ten belgians who i sent to get the lady minister .
what 's happening ?
hold the line here . do not shoot ! the colonel stabilizes the situation , his men watch the militia drive by . paul approaches oliver
i 'm sorry , i ca n't possibly take them paul . i 'm overrun with refugees . as soon as we can stabilize the situation we 'll take them .
yes sir , but these people they can not stay here . i 've heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium ?
paul , i 've sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister , she 'll need a room .
get him a room , but tell no one he is here . paul will look after you .
yes , colonel monsieur xavier , the minister of finance .
paul , you know who this is ?
i will do nothing unless you help me now .
you will tell them the truth .
you think they will believe you ?
i led no massacres .
who will tell them ? you need me to tell how you helped the hotel . the others who have gone , they blame you for all their misfortune . they say you led the massacres .
i committed no war crimes .
if you do not help me , you will stay on that list .
you lie .
when the europeans left , their soldiers gathered lists .
i am on a list ! what list ?
the americans , and the un they have you as a war criminal . you are on a list .
how so .
you are a marked man .
listen , you need me .
we are better here .
you can not go back to the hotel . the crazy men are going there now . better to come with me .
i do not want to go to gitarama , general .
i am going to do you a great favor . i am going to take you with us to gitarama .
please , general , call and put your policemen back at the gate .
pack those carefully , put them in my jeep , and guard them .
i hope we all get to do many things . can we go now ?
wonderful country , wonderful golf . i wonder - will i ever go back ? what do you think ?
no , sir .
ishca baha - the water of life . i went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world . have you ever been to scotland ?
no .
you know what the scottish call it ?
today .
when ?
we have decided to move the government to gitarama .
what do you mean , general ?
they can go where they want . they are in charge now .
where are they going ?
after the diplomat ! paul clambers in the back .
your police are at the gate ?
get in .
we must go to the diplomat .
bring back your policemen ...
i 'll be over .
the finest , and cognac , champagne . come and i will get them for you .
whiskey ?
general , sir . i am glad to find you . i have found you some supplies .
no . we have no way of finding other stock but i have money for you from the guests .
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty ? did they drink my whiskey ?
i 'm sorry , general . the cellar is empty .
where are my supplies ?
please , i have money . they 're driving into an ambush , it 's on the radio .
you said you had no whiskey .
please , general , i will give you money , whiskey .
i wish i were like you . look at my staff , they wo n't work , they listen to no one .
i am strong , paul , like a lion .
i admire you , general . how do you keep command of your men amidst such madness ?
i will see what i can do .
the front gate would be best , general .
if i were to spare a few policemen , where would i station them ?
well rewarded those were his words .
he did .
i understand general , but when i last talked to the president of sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect belgian property would be rewarded .
the police are very busy .
i am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel . perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us .
indeed , general . excuse me momentarily .
the americans ! who are they to put us on trial . let us imagine paul when their president kennedy was shot , they said it was a black man . then their politicians , their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us . what do you think would have happened ? no different .
'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial . lock them all away forever . no political risk , and big publicity . ' that 's what he said . i thought i 'd better tell you .
the high command ? our high command ?
the american said intervention is too costly , better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command .
and what will they do with these satellites ?
yes , they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder .
satellites ?
satellites .
watch everything ? how ? they are gone .
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything .
what did they say ?
a discussion between an american embassy official and a un colonel .
what did you overhear ?
yes , general . i am glad you came by . i overheard something that i think you should know about .
the united nations . madmen are on the streets , paul . but i will take care of you . your cellar is well-stocked , right ?
the united nations are still here .
as long as it is scotch . your white friends have abandoned you , paul .
i 'm sorry it is not glenmorangie .
oh , paul , talk to the coat check , please .
it 's a single malt , glenmorangie . i thought you 'd like it . anything you need , gentlemen , let me know .
paul , this scotch is exceptional .
take the river road back . it is clear .
let 's go .
why not ? we are half way there already .
) you can not kill them all .
their money is no good to them . soon all the ineysi will be dead .
what do you mean george ?
no whiskey , no spirits . your rich cockroaches at the hotel , they will have to do without their scotch . anyway , i have bled that cow enough paul .
you have no whiskey ?
beer yes , but no whiskey .
i need rice , beans , beer , and your best whiskey .
everything is double the price now , you do understand that ?
at least .
a bargain buy , from china . ten cents each , i 'll get a dollar .
i am always glad to see you paul .
very good .
business is good at the hotel ?
time is money , george . we need extra beer today .
politics is power , paul . and money .
i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics .
youre drunk .
go ! what the fuck sort of journalists are we , running from a war ? i 'm ashamed . are you ? well , are ya ' ?
lets go , jock .
fuck you .
here , have a sandwich .
oh my god !
you fucking see that !
what is it ?
holy shit ! holy shit .
great . no kidding , when will they be here ? excellent . yes , call then .
satellite feed .
we cover the story from here until we can get proper protection .
ground rules ! where the fuck do you think you are , wimbledon ?
were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car . that 's the ground rules .
for fuck 's sake , gloria there 's a big news story out there ! we need to get out and cover it .
thank god .
very soon .
when will they be here ?
the news room has heard that the french and the belgians are putting together an intervention force .
of course .
good . i 'd like to book a massage .
the fifth room is your broadcast room .
just give me a moment to get your keys .
great , i really need a shower .
i saw the sign .
are you sure this is the river road ?
just drive , gregoire .
the fog is too heavy , sir .
for supplies , you drive .
where are we going , sir ?
do n't worry . i have a job this morning . i must go to visit my good friend george rutagunda . you know george ?
please , except my humblest apologies ...
gregoire it is good to see you back to work .
let me ask you mr. manager , do you notice a smell of cockroaches ? if i were to leave this room , i 'm sure i could find this smell . i know people who could cleanse it . but maybe it does n't bother you ? why is that ? are used to this smell ? not me , i need a clean room to escape it .
i am in charge now . get back to work or i 'll fire you .
i do n't have to listen to you anymore .
get out of this room and get back to work .
gregoire , what are you doing here ?
mr. manager .
give me the phone .
there are no more rooms .
take it for christ sake . i wish it was a fucking aeroplane .
this is a rolex , i ca n't take it .
i know that , paul . i 'm sorry .
i would never do that .
give her what she wants , room , food , anything . charge it all . do n't you put her out , paul .
this goes out live ?
perfect timing .
i 'm afraid i ca n't do that , mr. daglish .
can we phone them in , paul ?
i 'm sorry , mr. daglish , this is the mille collines . no working girls here .
did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you ? you know ?
good for you . we 're having a little trouble , paul . we booked five rooms , but ...
promoted . house manager .
they moved you from the diplomat ?
i am delighted to see you , mr. daglish .
paul , how the hell are ya ' ?
i will remember that name . let 's go .
rusesabagina . paul rusesabagina .
do n't lie to me . what 's your name ?
call , sir ?
who did you call ?
you do n't have time . if i do not have the names , so that i can pick out the traitors , then i will kill everyone here in this car park . get in there now .
that will take time .
are you trying to make a fool of me ? there are no europeans left in that hotel . get me the names of all the cockroaches in there .
the guest list . it has n't been updated since the murder of the president .
anderson , arthurs , boulier . what is this ?
i ... ah ... need some time . please give us twenty , thirty minutes . people are sleeping .
it 's an order . get everyone out now .
why sir ?
everyone must leave the hotel now .
yes , sir . what is wrong ?
you are the manager ?
they have him in the lobby , go quickly .
show us the manager . he wears a suit .
one thousand francs .
how much ?
no . but i make cards . would you like me to make you two cards ?
you have our cards .
what cards ?
our cards , please .
what ?
excuse me .
show me your id
he will be here .
the commander is not here .
we are to meet mr. rutagunda .
what do you want ?
i will give you my house .
everyone is dead there . the dogs eat the bodies in the street . i have to go .
how do you know ?
no , it is impossible . that side of town has been destroyed in the fighting . the children are dead .
i need one last favor . go back and get the twins .
it is dangerous to be here . the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches .
no blood . as i left a neighbor , an old woman , waved to me . i went to her house . she has the little girls . they are safe .
was there blood ?
i will see what i can do .
this would be an enormous favor to me . i am a man of means , mr. garandi . when this nonsense is over i will be most grateful .
no , no . this is a very dangerous part of town . i can not do this .
i need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family .
i need a great favor .
terrible times , paul . there are bodies everywhere . i can not stay here .
we ca n't wait . we all go together or not at all .
they should go one truck at a time . when the first truck gets through to the airport , then the others will follow .
they will surely kill us here . it 's over here . we have to take the chance .
this time the militia will kill us .
also , this is your bill for the last week .
pack the bags , we have to move .
yes they are . however if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms .
the third floor are low class rooms .
i 'm going to put you on the third floor .
move ? where to ?
i 'm afraid you will have to move room .
of course .
i will need a suite .
anais , it is so good to see you .
oh , my babies .
i have to go to the diplomat .
what 's wrong ?
the diplomat ! tatiana wakens , startled .
we have to . if i do not come , you must take them all by the hands and jump .
please do not talk like this .
our children can not see us die first . if the militia comes , you must hurry up to the roof . i will meet you there .
what sort of plan ?
we have to have a plan .
we are almost out of everything .
we are almost out of water .
paul ! then another voice .
i love you . keep the children safe .
i will follow on the next plane . go .
let me go . children get off .
i can not leave these people . i will wait for the twins .
no ! sit down now .
i have to stay .
no .
get on the truck , tatiana .
ask them to wait a little longer . for the twins .
we wait until 7:00. if he is not here with the twins he is not coming . we leave . that was your promise . go help the children .
a little longer , paul ?
i 'll try but we have to leave , with or without them . i want you to promise .
please , please try one more time .
we have to get out of here tatiana .
i will not leave without the twins .
a volkswagen !
a volkswagen .
i want to know .
what does it matter .
what sort of car ?
a car .
tell me what it was .
it was substantial .
what was the bribe ? what am i worth to you ?
to be closer . so that i could marry you .
why ?
i bribed the minister of health to have you transferred to kigali .
what ?
i had you transferred to kigali .
yes .
yes , when you worked as the nurse .
in ruhengeri ?
i have a confession . when we met ...
a kiss .
i hear we must pay for everything . how much for this ?
it 's alright . this is the only place i can find some peace .
please , paul , why do we have to go to the roof ?
i 'm not going alone . i 'll take gregoire with me . he 's a good hutu , and he wants to impress me now .
you can not go alone .
i have to , tatiana , we are only as valuable as the service we provide .
no , no .
to rutagunda 's place . it is close by .
go out ! where ?
i have to go out to get food .
we 're running out of beer and other supplies .
what 's the matter ?
maybe gregoire and the witch ate it .
so where is the lamb ?
lynch bages , 84. perfect with lamb , or fine rare beef .
do as i say . i will be there soon .
what for paul .
go to the roof now .
enough of this . we stay together . let me rest , i will feel better then .
your card says hutu . take our children , go and get the twins , pay money at the roadblocks . get them out . please .
what are you saying , tatsi ?
you could leave , paul .
i do n't know . colonel oliver says the un has three hundred soldiers for the whole country . black soldiers , pakistanis .
but who is left ?
listen to me woman . i said all the whites are leaving . the french , the italians , even the belgian un soldiers .
we have been abandoned .
what about us ?
they are being evacuated .
no . they are not dead . stop this .
my sister is dead , paul . they would not leave the children .
please go back , bring the children to us .
this is not bad news , tatsi . perhaps they fled or could not make it home . there is hope .
give him time .
he needs to be in a safe place . have you heard from mr. garindi ?
how can we help him .
no , odette says he 's in shock .
has roger spoken yet ?
i 'll try .
no answer . please send someone to get them , please .
any luck ?
it will do just fine .
this wo n't do .
zozo , get a key for two staff bedrooms . put these people in them .
i will not have them on my conscience . they will stay in my room .
what !
what are you going to do ? you can not drive them out onto the road . they can stay with me .
them . they almost got us all killed . i have done enough for them ! we can not look after them anymore .
get in .
paul , do n't let them die .
stay with the children .
what is it , paul .
where are you hurt , son ?
oh , my god !
dawn . then they go .
please , paul , 'til first light .
they know you are tutsi !
please . let them stay 'til morning . the militia will not come here , they know you are a hutu with influence .
send them home . we are not the police . what do we have to protect them ?
they came through the bushes , over the wall . what could i do ?
is every tutsi in the neighborhood here ?
i tried already . the phones do not work .
i sent them home . go and call them .
where are thomas and fedens ?
murdered ! by whom ?
the president has been murdered .
jean baptiste !
paul ! paul 's eyes adjust , he recognizes many of his neighbors , all crowded into this small room . then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste .
connections ? i have no connections , only favors . if i call to help victor , a general will think `` paul rusesabagina is a fool . he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody . '' then my hard work is doubly squandered . i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all . please leave these things to my good judgment .
they do not have your connections .
he was not family . family is all that matters . do you think if you or i were being dragged from here , any one of them would lift a finger to help us ?
victor was not a stranger , he was our neighbor .
no , i could not . what do you know about favors tatiana , about barter and deals ?
you could have asked for a favor .
i could n't help .
why did n't you call your contacts in the army ?
we must do something .
no .
please , be quiet .
call your friends in the army . call someone . victor is harmless . this is a mistake .
what ?
do something .
homework ?
simon , next door , the charingas ' boy .
of course .
let 's have dinner first .
he wants your wisdom .
thomas wants advice ?
yes , with fedens and the children .
your brother 's here ?
i asked odette to take a look at little anais . she has a rash .
good evening , odette , who is sick this time ?
i can give you many political answers paul but the truth is that africa is not worth a single vote to all of them : french , british , americans .
why ?
paul , i pleaded with the president to go in and get you all . he told me it will not happen .
thank you , sir , you saved our lives .
i managed to get the president of france on the phone .
there is one thing i need right away .
very well . but if this thing gets worse , we must close . if there 's anything you need , call anytime .
yes , paul , i remember . the mille collines is a very important property for sabena . our directors believe we should close down , shutter the place until this unrest is over ?
paul rusesabagina , mr. godefroid . the house manager . i met you on your last visit .
can i have your name again ?
it 's true , sir , the water has been turned off .
what is this about no water ?
as the trucks go .
when ?
i saw gregoire make a call , sir ?
let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people .
thank you , sir .
you are my family now , zozo , my brother . i will get you out of here .
many beers .
how much beer ?
sir , gregoire has been taking beers .
where has all our beer gone ?
the lieutenant wants the register .
what are you doing ?
open up the ballroom , we 'll put them there . and zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it .
what do we do with all these people ?
sir , no one wants to work . they say the boss has left .
where 's housekeeping ? they wo n't pick up .
what ! paul storms off .
he has taken the presidential suite .
where are the receptionists ? where 's gregoire ?
how dead ?
twelve are dead .
boss , some of those men are my neighbors , they know i 'm tutsi .
sit up , smile , zozo , do n't attract attention to yourself .
many times .
you have taken business class ?
maybe . but in business class there are fine wines , linens , belgian chocolates .
that is why they call it coach ?
it depends where you sit zozo . in coach it is like the bus to giterama .
what is it like to fly on a plane , sir ?
you are with me , zozo , do n't worry .
beg your pardon sir , you are hutu . you are safe there .
what 's wrong ?
rutaganda 's place ?
paul , do everything you can to buy time . i will call you back .
the french . they supply the rwandan army .
paul , if you have one call in all the world to stop this , who would you call ?
yes , thank you mr. president .
paul , are you there ?
now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff . i have ten minutes left .
the staff and guests ! how many ?
the staff , the guests .
all . what do you mean all ?
i do not know , sir . i think they will kill us all .

we have a big problem . the hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel .
paul . are you alright ?
on the street .
where ?
there are soldiers .
who is this simon ?
please , papa , i have a secret path .
no , i do n't want you going on the street .
simon has a new pet . can i go see it ?
why the hurry , roger ?
thank you , roger .
for food and clothes , and all that grows , etc , etc . dear lord , thank you .
go downstairs , i will help you .
i do n't know .
what is his room number ?
i 'm looking for moses seradungu 's room .
can i help you ?
moses , moses seradungu .
okay : this may sound crazy , but --
and how the hell are we going to do that ?
but they did n't see it happen , they still have doubts . what we need is another body , and steven 's bloody hands right next to it !
how much more do they need than your death at his hands ?
-- but nobody has yet , donald . they just have n't been brought to that breaking point . they have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger .
it 's not , baby . just a matter of minutes now , before somebody pulls the trigger --
-- the whole thing is falling apart !
-- bullshit --
-- there 's plenty : for all we know , steven 's got her spying on us right now --
-- price killed her , there 's no other explanation --
so we do n't even know if she 's alive or dead --
not yet .
-- there 's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan . you ever find out what happened to melissa marr ?
it 's complicated . but do n't worry --
so what stopped her ?
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that jenzen girl . the little bitch has the right stuff . she nearly put a bullet in price right after your `` demise . ''
-- the james dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
`` but you did n't , ma'am . we have all these witnesses that saw ... '' well , whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- `` oh , no , officer , i 'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- what ? what do you mean he 's dead ? it 's all my fault , i may as well have killed him myself ! ''
still alive , but it 's just a matter of time . and then will come your miraculous resurrection --
and what 's steven 's status ?
convinced all those that needed convincing : you 're an official dead lady .
you 're the doctor , sweetheart . 'guess the atropine worked , then .
easy . you 've got to keep still for a bit , the last thing we need is a coronary .
no need for divorce and that messy division-of-assets thing when they kick before you do .
i 'm confused .
oh , he 's got no problem with that : i 'm his fourth .
not too big on it myself -- but then again , not on marriage either .
we'd 've been splitsville years ago , with me the richest single woman in recorded history -- but steven does n't `` believe '' in divorce .
if that 's the fact , price , okay , you 've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
take a bow , steven , you 've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me .
if you do n't calm the hell down i 'm gon na strap you in for electro-shock !
oh dear .
jesus h. christ !
it was on my dad 's list of `` things to do . '' but the house did him first .
why in god 's name was n't this thing removed years ago ? ?
problem ? no problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know , things to see , people to do ?
pritchett , take it down a couple hundred decibels , what is your problem ?
mr. price ? mrs. price ? somebody ? hello ? ?
i 'm moved beyond words .
part of the original structure . when it was still an asylum . guy who ran the place -- dr. vannacutt -- found it `` inspirational . '' from some german cathedral a million years ago : `` driving the demons from the mind . ''
not at all !
more of price 's spook-house bullshit .
name 's pritchett . watson pritchett . i own the house , my father built it . and now i just need to get you into it . so ...
if you do n't mind me asking ... who are you ?
c'mon .
do n't think it 'll be a problem .
-- the `` saturation chamber . '' where he wanted to put me .
now what do we do ? we 've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
no . i 'm going back to try and find ms. marr . if she 's hurt , i 'll tend to her . dead , then i 'm coming back for him .
more the merrier .
yeah ... something .
something just must 've ... frightened her , that 's all .
-- uh , excuse me , just one quick question ? how long before this damn thing unseals itself ?
oh , for chrissake --
more to the point . where 's our host ?
looks like we 're it .
i think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation !
if there really is someone else in this house , i think the four of us can handle the situation .
did n't catch his or her name , just followed them down here . somebody all in white surgical gown .
oh , really : who ?
running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --
-- what was he doing here ?
upstairs , too . come with me , i 'll show you another body , a friend of mine named schecter --
-- she 's not dead ! just have to get her heart pumping aqain !
i 'm sorry --
i do n't know ! !
where is it ? ?
ca n't imagine by who . i do n't suppose the truth would interest you : that i 've never had another wife but evelyn .
accidents . fatal . each of your prior wives , so we 've been informed .
excuse me ?
three times , to be exact .
even if i were inclined , i 've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife .
is she alright ?
what ?
ms. marr !
melissa !
well , until that 's found , i think it 's a good idea we all stick together . or would n't that fit into your plans , baby ?
there must be some other way out .
-- i 'm sure you did .
i got an engraved -- literally -- invitation -- with my name --
you 're not my list .
donald w. blackburn , m.d .
just for the record : what are the rest of your names ?
a very , very scary game . but then look at the bright side : if there 's only one of you still upright at dawn , you 'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket .
what are you playing here , price ?
you sure ? you 'll be alright by yourself ?
i 'll stay , if it 'll ease your mind .
should n't somebody like , stand guard or something -- just in case ?
and i think that 's case --
-- i did : down here .
yeah , me too .
yeah , what the hell , i 'll go .
-- fuck you !
put it this way : if it 's your face on that tape , mr. moses , we 're one gunshot away from solving all our problems --
if this is someone 's idea of a joke --
this thing 's going nowhere .
as a tumor .
nice touch , pritchett : subtle .
over here !
pritchett !
up here --
pritchett , is that you ?
me ? you 've got ta be kidding .
if you know where it is , get there !
it 's not going to let us out !
hail mary , full of grace -- the house is growing !
okay -- i 'll admit it : i 'm totally , clinically insane . but i 'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight . it 's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now .
what ?
uhhhh ...
poor mr. price --
oh . jesus .
what 's life , anyway ? waves ... ? sound ... ? light ... ? electricity ... ? i do n't know ... phone lines ... ?
how 's a goddamn building gon na send out invitations ?
price did n't make the guest list ... the house did . it wants vengeance .
shit , pritchett ! ! !
the ... fourth of july .
what 's down there ?
yes .
-- of this place , goddamnit , pritchett !
left , goddamnit !
hey ! where 'd you guys go ?
did it work ?
new wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia . 19th century , i think : what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane . the vannacutt version was : bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce , it 'd traumatize 'em back to `` normalcy . ''
hell no ! ! the house will kill ya !
so you 're saying as long as that door stays locked , we 're okay ?
the soul of the house . everything that 's corrupt about it ... my father trapped it in there just before he died . you see , he purchased the house to restore it ... we were going to live here ... nothing can live here . i was just a kid ... the first time i saw it , i thought it was beautiful ... it was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room ... then it started to move ... then death started to happen ... first the workers.. six in all ... then my father ...
what is it ? what 's in there ?
nothing .
what 's in there ?
-- but i imagine we 'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then .
-- well , let 's hear it for small miracles --
a cleaning crew 's supposed to arrive at 9:30 tomorrow morning -- i think the power of the house fades at dawn .
so , what ? you 're saying we 're stuck here the rest of our lives ?
i lied . the house is alive and we 're all gon na die .
you said that was an accident .
you 'll never know 'til you walk through that door !
you 're totally full of shit , are n't you ?
nonsense ! just bad press . all the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father 's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents .
'less the place really is haunted .
i 'm just the greeter -- and in that capacity , i now urge you all strongly to --
i wan na know first : to what do i owe this honor ? i mean , i never even heard of this guy .
pritchett , you 're not joining this necktie party ?
-- closed .
-- yeah , we did that --
-- the stained glass --
adrenaline -- in your bag , blackburn , you must have --
oh , jesus ... .
prove it how ?
prove it .
married . once . same woman . all these years . she just slithered up the stairs .
best of a nightmare .
evelyn , could you just zip it for a moment ? it looks like we 're stuck here 'til morning -- let 's make the best of it .
take the gun .
i 'll meet you down there .
yeah . but , hey , anybody who 's not `` comfortable '' with the rules , you 're free to walk , anytime . seven digits poorer , goes without saying .
this is nuts .
the second the sun hits tomorrow morning . assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you 're still alive , of course . any other questions ?
and we get this money when ?
right here , mr. pritchett . as well as five other bona fide , bank drafts for one million dollars each . made out to cash .
jesus !
what ?
i do n't do groups .
better put it on hold 'til we find pritchett .
yeah . and under other abnormal circumstances , i think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones .
you okay ?
what --
run .
where did it go ?
all the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there 's got to be some way of raising them manually . they did n't just appear out of thin air -- there 's got to be pulleys , cables or something , that make them go up and down .
it 's succeeding !
no . it 's just trying to frighten us .
for chrissake give me a hand !
the opening 's still too small , we 'll never get through !
-- was that ? ?
what --
we 're safe ?
do n't think it 's even an issue .
he 's dead ... ?
it 's okay , everything 's okay now .
he 's got ta still be down here .
price ! !
it 'll have to do .
this is the best we 're gon na do .
what about that other guy ?
that 's crazy !
or an on-line computer .
everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned . there are five of us ...
wait a minute ... what are you saying ?
holy shit ! now we know how the guest list was made up . look , these names ... head nurse , ruth-ann stockard ... bjorn jensen , electro therapy ... jasper marr , thomas steven price ... they 're all here !
better living through electricity .
cheery looking bunch .
maybe there are notes or drawings of this place , showing how those plates work .
what are you looking for ?
let 's try down here ...
good point .
back where ?
i think we should have taken a right back there .
-- listen to the man --
-- you lose either way , price --
-- where the hell were you ?
-- that 's the fact , bud --
i was upstairs with eddie --
you 're starting to sound like pritchett .
-- not a chance -- there 's too much weirdness down there i do n't think even bullets are gon na stop .
-- no . the basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing : big long iron levers just lying there --
no prob : i 'll just hop down the hardware store --
it 's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker 'll pop !
sure , with three days and a blowtorch .
we can do it ...
no -- keep pulling , it 's moving !
you hear somebody ?
and then where are we ?
an answer , i hope : exactly what -- or who -- melissa was taping .
what the hell good is fixing that gon na get us ?
hey , if everybody 's gon na kill each other , could you do it in another room ? i 'm trying to get something accomplished here .
how you gon na manage that with a new blow-hole in your dome ?
no ... not air --
well , she went somewhere ! she did n't just up and disappear into thin air !
not in the movie biz . so , c'mon , gim me the truth .
there 's always exceptions .
most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers . and i have yet to meet one executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house . you do n't fit the bill -- not even close .
why not ?
i do n't think so ...
i told you already : jennifer jenzen , executive v.p . of --
start with the name you were born with , and we 'll work forward from there .
what ? deep down inside ?
you need to get out more .
most fun i 've had all day .
thanks .
this whole place ca n't be wired to just one circuit --
why ?
three steps forward -- i want to get up there .
do n't push it .
i 'm better than that .
and you 're not really as large and useless as you seem .
i thought she was dead . for sure .
is she ... alright ?
how 'd you make your guest list , price : throw darts at a phone book ?
then what the hell are we doing here ?
eddie moses , communications attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means : i work for a messenger service .
melissa margaret marr , celebrity .
i hope not .
so , what ? the thing with the glass ? price did that ?
cheer up : before the night 's through , i 'm sure one of us 'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something .
... birds . just seagulls or something walking on the glass , goddammit .
the guy whose hair i do has his own tv show . all i 've got is a blow-dryer and a dream .
you 've got your own tv show ?
i knew this whole place 'd be pure gold ! pritchett , point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts ! if i can get something bizarre enough on tape , i think i can parlay it into getting me some kind'a robert stack `` unsolved most- wacked-out home videos '' gig . no more five afternoons a week of sex-change- nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em .
so where 's the party ?
... jesus h. christ .
steven ? ?
evelyn ... get up ... now !
no . ohmygod , pritchett was right -- the house < u > < b > is < /b > < /u > haunted .
no ...
-- witnesses to what ? you 're already dead , evelyn ! happy birthday , baby --
-- wit ... nesses --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place : i 'm going to murder you , evelyn , with the greatest of pleasure --
-- what ... are ... you ... going ... to --
-- anything , sweetheart , you need only speak --
steven --
funky little house , ai n't it ? friends , your hostess is now going to retire for what 's left of the night . if you need me , i 'll be in the bedroom upstairs -- but try and fight that need : the door 'll be locked , i 'll be trying to sleep , and if anyone so much as breathes in the keyhole , i 'm gon na empty this thing into their fucking head . thank you all for the bestest birthday a girl could have .
they were n't loaded when i put them in there !
question answered .
jesus !
-- thank you ! all the cards finally on the goddamn table !
-- that was n't my original plan , but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- oh , for chrissake , that 's a given ; we all know that knocking me off is the bottom line here --
if i had one , evelyn , i think you know who 'd be first and last --
-- and who 's next on your list ?
-- i pose you the same question --
i mean , did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
asking the wrong person again .
game , set and match , steven . you 've outdone yourself . and i know it 's not good manners to ask the magician how he did it , but inquiring minds are desperate to know : just what did really happen to ms. marr ?
stalking the wild poltergeist .
where is she ?
fine with me . just somebody then better go and round up melissa marr .
a simple leak , if it 's okay with you .
and where are we off to , mr. price ? check the wiring on the animatronic mummies ?
only one way i can think of , sweetheart .
so how 's a girl to know if these things are loaded , baby ?
must be getting old , stevie -- you 're repeating yourself -- this is the exact same set-up you used for the son-of-sam hunt back in '94 . girlie , open up that casket there and see what you find .
what are you talking about ?
-- in the act .
-- the sadistic prick --
oh , no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone 's buck to nail the bitch --
really ? well , let it rip .
huh . and here i had a completely different theory .
sure it was n't . hey , anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies ? do n't raise your hands all at once .
-- asking the wrong guy -- was n't me who closed it .
my guests were shredded . it 's your sick little scene now , steven : enjoy . i 'm going to go run scalding water on the places you just touched me , and then i 'm calling a cab .
now , there 's the simple country gal i married . let 's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you : corny as kansas on the fourth of july .
i know .
you 're hurting me .
-- just not always in the sexual sense .
you know everything you do gets me hot .
which part of that fantasy turns you on most : me with other men -- or just the other men ?
you know how happy i 'd be if that was really true , evelyn ? and how positively goddamn delirious if you were n't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time !
all accidents until proven otherwise .
finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal , is n't it ? the `` o.j . '' knife with the not-quite- retractable blade ? your `` jim jones kool- aid '' that was exactly that ?
it you really loved me , steven , you 'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds .
sure know it was n't me . and if you say it was n't you -- then who the hell did , evelyn ?
what are you talking about ? you think i invited them ?
you tell me . i do n't know how you managed to hack into my mac , but : bravo .
then who are they ?
well , not quite . see , those people down there : they are n't the ones i invited .
i guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you . well , congratu-fucking-lations , steven : round one , you win .
shredded . sorry . decided to whip up one of my own : a group so hungry for money that they 'd be willing to do anything . i thought you 'd be more comfortable with your peers .
i gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they ?
oh , i think we 're going to have several .
could we have a word ?
have n't they already ?
you should n't be -- you were nearly just killed , sweetheart . and now that our birthday girl is finally here , let the games begin !
i 'm not laughing , steven .
i 'm impressed : i do n't think evelyn 's ever said those words to anything with genitalia .
do n't touch me !
oh . you think this is a request . well , think again . i 'm telling you : `` haunted hill '' is exactly where we 're having my party this year . you 'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
-- forget it . last birthday the manson family ranch , the year before that : jonestown .
are you still fucking < b > here < /b > ? ?
... wow ... .wow ! hey , ms. jenzen -- ?
and here 's your goddamn severance !
what ?
-- well , here 's a better one : you 're fired .
no , no , it 's just --
you think this is fucking funny ? ?
-- being utterly fucking useless , what else is new .
i was in the middle of --
you did n't think to ask ?
messenger just dropped it off . no return address .
well , who 's the damn thing < u > from < /u > ?
i do n't know , ms. jenzen .
maybe if i --
please ! something ! oh-god !
like what ? ? this is n't supposed to be happening ! !
do something !
i 've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it , everything 's fine .
first time for everything .
i would n't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded beanie babies had n't tested 100 % safe .
sources have told this reporter that the real reason your park 's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here . comment ?
i think it 's something better experienced then described .
and then what happens ?
ever seen one that starts at the top ? 20 stories worth of top ?
absolutely . no cheap thrills . a genuine journey to the brink of madness .
your roller coaster that is , quote : `` unlike any that has ever come before it . ''
my wife . where were we ?
business or pleasure , mr. price ?
i am .
he was right ! pritchett was right !
or somebody wanting me to believe that .
vannacutt ! !
thank god -- i was afraid i 'd be lynched without a quorum .
-- then i guess then it had to be you . sorry .
i think , pritchett , we 've got a situation here that even you ca n't explain away as `` ghosts . '' this is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
house 2 , guests 0 .
i remember ... it was a long time ago ... my father said : when the house was finally completed , make sure ... we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere !
what ?
i think ... i may have the answer .
not the plates : the house . why is no one listening to me ? ? it 's alive ! and once it 's made up its mind , it wo n't let anything out .
must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow .
would n't know what to do with it all --
-- even if i give you a million as well ?
-- my loss --
i think you 're gon na miss the bash of a lifetime --
sorry , pritchett , here you go .
-- it 's getting older by the second . mr. price , if i could just please have --
alright , mr. pritchett , let me just sign the damn thing .
i 'm ready now .
i ca n't remember at the moment .
she 's been marked for it . the house does that . happened to pritchett 's father . likely happen to you all . is n't that what you told me , mr. pritchett ?
not even for a million dollars , mr. price .
please ! i need your help .
do n't think so . stay the fuck back .
then tell me , please -- help me ... !
-- no more --
-- listen to me , goddamnit --
-- i 'll take the chance , come morning and cops , i 'll be proved right --
-- confirming everything we already know --
do n't test me , i 'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
well , i ca n't , sweetheart .
i 'll take my chances .
then just wait -- maybe this whoever 's got you next on the asylum 's equipment- test list . maybe a literal mind-blow inside the `` saturation chamber . ''
well , i do n't .
i was chasing after somebody i saw in the salon .
fascinated .
not just yet . would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why i ended up here in the basement ?
if you 've got a gun on you , price , i 'd hand it over now .
i never saw you --
i was upstairs !
-- no -- that 's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- i thought it was evelyn --
-- the window and door grates --
i think i 'll do what i damn well please .
i ... do n't think ... anybody should be touching the body .
something with the power , i do n't know ! !
what is it ? ?
i 'll try not to remember to warn evelyn .
good way to get your head blown off .
sorry .
-- i would n't worry , ms. jenzen : the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long . in the meantime , let 's all relax , have a drink , the evening 's young --
this is all maybe getting a little too strange --
very good . well , i think i can say with complete honesty : i 've never heard of any of you .
jennifer-jenzen-executive-v.p.- paragon-pictures .
oh , sorry . detail i guess i forgot to mention . you die , you lose . your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living .
what 're you talking about ?
you 're forgetting my lovely wife ; she 's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you .
yeah . why 's there five checks ? there 's only four of us .
do n't take your eyes off her for a second . i think she just declared war .
pretty amazing feat : all that shit down the basement and your wife 's up in the bedroom the whole time .
no . somehow -- i do n't know how -- she did it .
maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart .
it works .
no idea . i did n't even know the damn thing still worked !
then who did ? ?
i was just sitting here -- it happened . i had nothing to do with it .
rewind that .
-- it was n't me .
i mean , not that it did n't give evelyn the kind of coronary i had in mind , just ...
the lockdown thing .
-- hey ! next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that !
so disengage his flail arm mechanism and just make him a screamer .
`` dummy 6 '' keeps losing his arm .
problem where ? looked good to me .
evelyn , go stir your cauldron or something for a sec .
houston , i think we may have a problem .
-- ten .
-- hey ! --
how , he 's supposed to be dead !
he must 've unsealed the room !
pritchett : what is going on ?
oh , dear .
price !
he would have been back by now .
excuse me ?
blackburn 's dead .
you coming , or are you waiting for blackburn ?
i thought you understood ... . it 's the souls of vannacutt 's dead ... the insanity ... the horror ... victims burned alive ... all that pain percolating somewhere in the house for seventy-some years ... ... singing this will be the day that i die ... this will be the day that i ... .
pritchett , what is this `` core of darkness '' ?
this ? this is nothing . you 've only been dealing with the house itself . you have no idea what you 're tinkering with . sooner or later , the darkness that is at the core will get out ... one of you will release it ... not meaning to , of course ... then ... ... bye , bye , miss american pie ...
there is something very not normal going on here !
accumulated evil ... festering for decades ... but i 'm a drunk ... so do n't listen to me .
and you think it 's in there ?
not ghosts ... at least not what you 're thinking ... vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house ...
ghosts killed your father ?
i said we should n't come down here . very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels , both . there 've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it 's exactly as it was in 1931 .
you should really open this place to the public , pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives .
well , that leaves you with two options then , does n't it : either show me where and maybe we get out of here -- or it 's spend-the-night-sleep-tight .
you 'll never find it , it 's a maze down there .
no , you do n't want to go down there . i am going down there . and i 'm going to find < u > < b > reverse < /b > < /u > on this thing and floor it .
the basement -- but , believe me , you do n't want to go down there .
pritchett , this `` lockdown '' thing -- it 's got ta have like a master control -- you know machinery , gears , whatever -- somewhere in this place ?
believe me , we need to .
uh , excuse me ? do n't think i 'm not having the time of my life watching this train wreck that 's your marriage -- but this is n't what i had in mind ... i want to know that we can get out of here if we need to .
why not ?
wo n't do any good .
has n't been a telephone in this house in over 60 years .
well , then , how 'bout maybe we call someone ?
do n't know that it does .
what 's going on ?
oh , no .
i ca n't comment until i get paid .
of course he did , for god 's sake . did n't he , mr. pritchett ?
he must 've beaten us all here !
-- guess we know where mr. price is now .
wish i could take the credit , but --
it better be -- he still owes me $ 25 grand for renting the place for the night ! here , let 's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely !
but the million bucks each , that 's for real ?
-- something horrible ... i do n't understand --
-- i 'm coming --
something ... .happened --
keep talking , i 'll find you !
sara ... ?
melissa , it 's sara -- is that you ?
for the love of god ... .please ... ?
melissa ... ?
please ... ..anyone ... .help me ?
over here .
-- eddie ! !
the style of dress on the girl ... it coincides with the era marion foster killed herself . who else could have gone in there and done something like that ?
we do n't have proof of that .
it might have been her mother .
so many unanswered questions . why was she buried there . and who killed her ?
colleen .
what was her name ?
it does n't say . but that 's not what interests me . there 's no death certificate for the daughter . anywhere .
i did a cross search , death certificates with this address . james and marion foster . they had a daughter . right here , it says james died , 1882 , pneumonia . marion dies september the next year . suicide .
did you find something ?
these records only go back to 1880. but ... ... wait a minute ...
what 's the matter ?
damn it .
you say you saw some activity here ?
i feel something . it 's faint , but ... it 's there ...
good-bye .
good-bye .
there 's no need to be .
i 'm sorry .
it will heal .
how 's your arm ?
a few years older , perhaps .
are you all right ?
no !
did you find her ? !
why do n't you pass me your plate ?
it looks delicious ...
yes . it was .
well , i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us .
so was i. the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not .
i have to admit i was skeptical . until now .
there were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university . i went and heard him speak , and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts .
how did you meet dr. shea ?
no , i live about in wexford . it 's about a five hour drive .
thank you . if you told me two years ago we 'd be living here , i would never have believed it . do you live around here ?
i have to admit you really have a beautiful home .
i 'll be able to do a search , to find out who lived here previously . and who died here .
what will they tell you ?
town records are coming up now .
suppose not .
they do n't build them like this anymore .
pearl , is the twilight , the divinity ... onyx is the sickle , death ...
what do these ingredients mean ?
the knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed .
i do n't understand .
by freeing them .
by killing them ?
the dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart , according to ancient beliefs -
it 's origin is unknown . the symbol does correspond to a dagger i acquired many years ago .
where does this amulet come from ?
that poor little girl .
may you find the peace you 've sought in vain for so long .
i 'm ok mommy .
oh my god , what happened to you ? my baby -
what do you mean ? mommy ? you 're scaring me !
your father does n't love us anymore !
go to your room ! now !
h-how long will it take ?
we 'll get it later .
what about all my other stuff ?
we 're going to go someplace new .
where are we going to go , mommy ?
yes , we 'll be leaving soon .
are we leaving mommy ?
i 'm scared !
my angel !
ok ...
aubrey , come on down and have some dinner !
she 's down ... how do you mean honey ?
she 's down ...
she talks to me .
can you talk to her ?
yes .
honey , is n't your friend 's name colleen ?
no it wo n't - no it wo n't !
it 's going to hurt us !
who ... is colleen ?
maybe it was colleen ...
well then who did ? !
i did n't do anything , mommy .
do n't play games with me , little girl .
we 'll have every leprechaun in ireland here honey .
can i do it again tonight ?
well i bet you they 're happy .
mommy , the leprechauns drank the milk last night .
sure .
can we leave out a bowl of milk , mommy ?
my god , i heard something !
help me ! please ! ! !
take me to her .
she 's down . help her ...
she 's hiding .
where is she now ?
she 's here .
where is she ?
she says she 's lonely ...
aubrey run ! aubrey stares in horror at maura - just then the knife fades away as maura rolls over , returned to normal -
mommy !
good night daddy .
good night angel ...
well , that all depends .
are we going back to california daddy ?
daddy help !
oh my god ! she 's in there !
daddy , please ! ! !
do n't be afraid !
mommy please help me !
fight it back aubrey . fight it back as hard as you can !
i ca n't move !
it 's dark ! i ca n't breathe !
we 're here aubrey ! look , do n't be afraid . we want you to come back to us ...
that 's great , honey .
look daddy ! it 's empty !
did you ever see a leprechaun ?
that 's father , aubrey . seamus well yes i did . lived here my whole life .
did you grow up in ireland mister ?
for good luck honey .
why ?
he 's blessing the house .
what 's he doing daddy ?
ok. if you want this room , you can have it .
i want this one , daddy .
sure . did you see the others ?
can i have this room daddy ?
i 'm all right ...
you 're bleeding .
i 'm ok .
are you all right ?
what 's happening !
maura !
no ... no !
we 'll destroy you ... destroy all of you !
not going ! are you out of your mind ? ! wait !
we 're not going .
maura , what is this !
what are you talking about ?
nothing 's changed , has it . you still want to deceive me ?
what ?
do you think i 'm a fool ?
know what ?
you do n't think i know ?
no . you two are the most important things in my life . i do n't ever want to lose you .
should i ...
you know , i was thinking ... all that stuff father seamus said ... about discord , distrust ... we 're doing all right , are n't we ? you do n't have any doubts about me , do you ?
ok ...
i 'm fine .
you seem to appreciate the local scenery .
it does n't matter to me . what do you mean by that ?
aubrey !
aubrey !
aubrey ? ! aubrey ? !
she 's gone !
oh my god where is she !
good . i 'll start bringing things in .
i think everything 's ready .
how are we doing ?
you , an imaginary friend . that 's what she calls her .
a friend ?
she has a ... friend . colleen .
what are you talking about ?
are you ok ?
whoa there ...
i 'm sure this sounds crazy to you .
it just disappeared . literally .
i 'm being realistic . look , i have a spiritual side . i mean , we had a priest come in and bless the house . that should count for something .
voodoo stick ? it 's nothing like that will . you 're just being cynical .
just because i have an open mind does n't mean i 'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house .
what about keeping an open mind ?
oh come on !
i do n't know . someone who ... knows about this kind of stuff .
who ?
well what power lines , will ? where ? maybe we should call someone about it .
there 's got to be an explanation . it could be a magnetic flux or something , maybe the power lines are giving off something . who knows ? i do n't know , i think it 's kind of interesting .
maybe eliza was n't so crazy after all .
well , i try to keep an open mind , but ...
well what do you think it is ?
yeah , i 'd say some weird things have happened .
but do you agree with me ?
i do n't know what i 'm saying .
so what are you saying ?
weird sounds , things moving , lights going off . the videotape ...
well something just happened to the power upstairs ... maura heads off and shakes her head , troubled by the event -
it was in the cellar . weird .
what is it ?
did n't you just see the power go off and on ? i just had a bulb break on me !
no .
were you fooling with the power ?
the heater 's here .
ok .
... set up some more things .
yeah , well i 'll be joining you shortly . i just want to ...
she 's asleep . i think that 's what i need , too . i 'm starting to see things .
no . maybe it was aubrey .
i do n't know . that 's strange .
what the hell is that ?
it 's not going to work . i 'm too smart for you .
what ?
are you playing tricks on me ?
i do n't think she willed it to me out of sentiment . she did n't even know who i was . it 's just ... tradition .
god rest her soul .
or what she was worth .
not really . she was just one of those names you hear growing up . you know , so-and-so who lives in ireland . i really do n't think anyone knew about this place .
did anyone in your family keep in touch with her ?
i wish i knew more about her .
to our family .
to our family .
whatever you say .
it 's just going to take a while .
look , i thought we were all right on this , maura . it 's over . you know that .
you did n't think much about that before .
well maybe we do n't need to remind her of it . she has a lot more to adjust to ... new friends , new schools ... it would be good if she had a stable family environment .
aubrey knows more about us than you think .
what will aubrey think ?
i just , i do n't know ...
oh come on ...
will , maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while .
what 's the matter ?
must be ...
who knows ... we have to get used to living around here . maybe good help is hard to find .
well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it was n't . i 'll have to call her .
the place is pretty dusty .
i hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service .
yeah i 'll look into that tonight .
now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater .
ok ok ... we 're just gon na head inside here ...
i could use a little help . we have to return the van soon .
white meat will be fine ...
is white meat all right for you , mr. shea ?
you 'll have to settle for turkey .
i 'm hungry enough to eat a horse .
yeah , they told us this was the best .
maura .
maura .
you 've done your homework , mrs. south .
before .
i 'm not sure , but i can check . did the events start before or after you discovered this ?
if we have a troubled spirit here , we have to find out why it 's troubled .
ok , so we have a ... presence . what do we do about it ?
she 's at school . we 've tried not to upset her more than she 's been .
where is your daughter ? she might be able to give us some information .
what about the other five percent ?
we usually find nothing . we 've debunked many a reported haunting . about ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation .
what do you mean , unfortunately ?
we 're usually successful in detecting the source of most problems . unfortunately .
i think we should do it .
i could see if i detect the presence of something .
we do n't know .
well that 's what we 're here for . i mean -
not at all . i 'm just trying to put together all the evidence , to determine what it could possibly be .
come back to us honey !
she 's coming back . keep talking !
come back to us honey , do n't be afraid !
concentrate ! she can hear you !
aubrey ? it 's mommy .
go ahead . i believe right now she may hear you .
so what should we do , father ?
now you must listen to me . this force is like a parasite , or a virus . it feeds on doubt , suspicion , discord ... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her .
the blood of a woman is birth , life . it is part of the ceremony . seamus offers up the pin - maura waits a beat , then takes it -
why ?
i 'm going to need some blood . it must be from a woman .
what !
your daughter 's been taken .
i took pity on the poor woman . this house is too big for one person to live alone in ...
well it 's nice that you were there for her .
in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here . she would call me , and i would come by .
it was a shame .
she attended the church for years . a dear woman , it was sad to see her decline so rapidly .
did you know her very well ?
thank you . i believe she would have wanted it .
may i come in ?
oh , that 's nice ...
... at her request . she was a very religious woman .
yes , i am .
you must be a londrigan .
we 'll be there .
well , you know where to reach me . the church is a stone 's throw away if you want to come to mass .
yes , they are .
take care of the girl . take care of your family . they are important .
i wish i had an answer . evil is powerful , more so every day it seems . but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us .
what 's going to happen ?
i did n't do anything ... god saved her ...
i do n't know what happened ... and i do n't know what you did ...
yes it is . will and seamus look at each other -
the rain is letting up .
it ca n't hurt you if you 're not afraid aubrey . think about us . we 're here for you , we love you ...
keep talking !
it will not take long ...
how long will it take !
i said nothing before , for fear you would n't believe me . i 've exorcised forces from this house . eliza knew , she was there . it wants another soul , the one we 've taken away . we must weaken it !
what are you getting at !
we must return it , if you want your daughter back .
so what does that have to do with aubrey ! where is she !
i said nothing before , for fear you would n't believe me . i 've been here before to cast evil from this house . the amulet is a guard against evil , blessed in countless rituals . it is an ancient ceremony of the early catholic church , a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost .
did you remove anything in the cellar !
what ... amulet ?
the amulet ...
this is n't happening ...
hopefully the whole sad chapter is over . and everyone , including your family , will find peace . will i just want to ... thank all of you , for everything you 've done for us .
we 'll never know for sure .
good night .
well there 's no time like the present . good night .
perhaps i 'll see you in church .
thank you .
i hope everything works out for you , and you find happiness in your new home .
well thank you for the offer , but i really have to go .
did you have dinner , father ? we have plenty .
well , i believe her mind was playing tricks on her , god rest her soul . she would hear things , see things ...
what was she afraid of ?
how can i help you ?
my name is father seamus . i 'm from holy rood church .
and you ... are ?
you must be the new tenants .
i do n't know ! trust what i 'm saying , we have to open this wall !
well what is it !
there 's something through that wall !
what ?
there 's something in there .
not at all , if it can help .
do you mind if i borrow it ?
runic ?
i see some faint lettering . it appears to be the ... runic alphabet ?
it was nailed to the cellar wall .
where did you find this ?
not really . oh , wait a minute .
do you have any other physical evidence , that we can look at ?
not someone . something . i 've never felt a presence that strong before .
so is that what all this is ? someone have a problem with us living here ?
looks like we have some animal hairs in here . maybe some kind of a rodent .
well , we could bring in special equipment , monitors , sound devices , things like that .
and what would you do ?
well it all depends on how much money you want to spend . a standard visit would run you about fifty pounds . that would include myself and an assistant .
oh .
no . but i 'm a clairvoyant . i can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place .
no . not on station time . my story . my time .
not on station time .
and i believe what you say . but this is tv . no pictures , no story .
i know what i saw .
right . like last night 's doozie .
yeah ? well , you just struck out . it may be a surprise to you , brad , but i want to do it the right way . not tight skirts . tight stories .
c'mon , joey . i 'm just trying to help you hit a home run here .
jesus christ ...
what , you think i 'm kidding ? i guarantee it . an inch more flank . boys upstairs get hot . bingo , you 're an anchor-woman .
i mean hardly any thigh . i 'm telling you , joey ; shorter skirt , more lift on the leg-cross ... and you 're made .
what do you mean ?
doc ? ... doc ... hello ?
you wanted a story . you got it . turn on the tv now . and then get your ass down here ... ...
hello ?
that is the story of my life .
ok. be careful . and lighten up . story of your life could be right round the corner .
you 'd lose the money-shots . no . i 'll catch a bus . or a cab . do n't worry about it . go .
joey ... . look , you wan na ride ? i can go by your place .
better hurry , doc . a real story . with a real reporter .
yeah , well like you said - it 's a mystery . but that 's all it is . mystery . not malice . what , you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
i know . i know . but it 's just so ... neat , is n't it ? the first gig that is n't cute kids or diet gurus and it 's taken away from me .
the box , joey . he wants the box .
wha ... . ?
your apartment .
so where is it ?
this is his first night on earth . he wants to close the door behind him . like all lieutenants , he covets command . there 's a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back . he has to destroy it .
then tell me what to do .
joey , you walked through your window from one reality to another . you 're stronger than you think .
i do n't know ...
i like you , joey . you ask all the right questions . there is something we can do but it will require great courage .
what can we do ?
he 'll do what he does best . but he 'll do it unfettered . he wants to walk the earth forever , indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering .
what will he do ? what does he want ?
because - monster as i was - i was bound by laws . the protocol of hell . the box had to be opened to let me out . the truly innocent were safe . that 's no longer true . the shell of the beast has been fleshed . what i was is out there , joey . in your world . unbound . unstoppable .
kirsty cotton . yes . but ... if your soul was freed , why are you back ?
and why are you back ? why are we here ?
something bad .
and what did you discover ?
the cusp of my life . what i was , what i am , what i will be ... past , present , future , all bound here at this timeless moment of decision . i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures . opening the box was my final act of exploration , of discovery .
and what is ... this frozen moment ?
the war pulled poetry out of some of us . others it affected differently . this is me a few years later . we 're in india , by the way , and it 's 1921. i was like many survivors . lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification . we 'd seen god fail , you see . so many dead . for us god , too , fell at flanders . we adjusted to the loss . and if we mourned , we mourned in silence . thousands drank themselves to death . others went further . i went further . i thought i was a lost soul . but , until this frozen moment , i did n't even know what the phrase meant .
hell is precisely what is going on , joey . and we have to stop it . i because of a special obligation , you because you 're the only person who can help . and because you know what is right , and just , and true . will you walk with me a while ?
captain spenser . elliott . i ... what the hell is going on ?
well done . brave girl . you 've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before , am i right ?
correct . the fields of france . and many dead flowers ... oh . forgive me . my name was spenser . elliott spenser . captain .
it 's ... i do n't know . first world war , right ?
you have to help me . you will understand . and no , you 're not dreaming . do you know where we are ?
wait ... wait . you ... you have to help me . i do n't understand . am i dreaming this ?
help me pick 'em up , terri . i think the lady just made a sale .
joey ... ?
god knows . anything . contacts . clues .
what am i looking for ?
here ! here ! pull over !
then you should n't even be around it . you know , it 's ...
for somebody else , alright ? not for me . i do n't do that shit anymore .
oh , terri ...
buying some drugs , alright ?
terri ?
what on earth were you doing down here ?
yeah . happening , is n't it ?
jesus . are you sure this is the street ?
it 's saturday morning . let 's go shopping .
sure . why ?
would you know this store again ?
i was downtown looking for a ... a friend . a guy i know . anyway , there was this store . like real old ? lotsa weird shit in there . i saw this statue . pillar . thing . i knew he 'd love it . you 've seen the club .
that you found . what do you mean you found it ?
no . jp . my last boyfriend ? he like owns the club . you know ? you were there ? he bought the statue .
woah . wait a minute . who ? the kid ?
yeah . i found it . i knew held like it and i figured ...
maybe not . but you know more than i do . you know something about this box . something about a statue ?
but i do n't know what 's going on .
no . he knows it wo n't . it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him does n't yet .
maybe he thinks it 'll come back .
every day .
and he still sits there ?
i do n't know his name ... i saw the whole story . a wounded bird was on his roof . i could hear its cries from here . he went straight to it . i couldn't 've . i 'd be frozen between pity and fear . but he was n't . its pain spoke directly to him . he picked it up . nursed it . fed it . and it got better . everyday he 'd watch the pigeon . everyday the pigeon would watch him . i saw him learn . learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete . and one day , just as afternoon became evening , he leaned over , opened the cage , and walked away . did n't look back . but he heard the sound of its wings .
who 's that ?
... but it is good . you know , over to the left , you can ...
i do n't think so . but it 's a fascinating subject . did you ...
cool . i read a book once . it was like all these people discovering who they used to be . you know , like reincarnation ? it was really good . you ever read that ?
no . i buy them to impress people . of course i 've read them .
wow . lotta books . you read all these ?
guys . sometimes friends . mostly guys .
how have you ... ?
jeez , i 've never owned anything . i have n't even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old .
the bank owns it . but i 'm working on it .
this is great . and it 's yours ? you like own it ?
no ! no , that 's ok. i like to . i love boiling water . it 's a specialty of mine . why do n't you go watch cartoons ?
i 'll do it !
i 'll boil some water .
ha ! i do n't know yet . first time . kitchen virgin , that 's me .
right ... that 's ... er ... that 's nice of you , terri . can i ask ? is it always this ... exploratory ?
i figured i 'd make breakfast .
that 's what i 'm trying to tell you ! ...
wait . wait . the chains . where did the chains come from ?
yeah ! that 's what i 'm saying ! and it was lying next to him . and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
wait a minute . he was already ... wounded ... when you found him ?
the thing ! he was lying there in the street , moaning . but he pointed at it ... 22
taken what ?
no . i 'd seen him in there a few times before . he was just a punk . i 'd never like danced with him or anything . anyway , he was a thief . he must 've taken it from the statue .
did you know him ?
but i do n't know anything ! really . i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street . he ...
yes i do . terri , something awful happened to that boy . i have to find out what it was .
oh . you wan na talk about that stuff .
it 's okay . it 's just someone burned me once .
sorry . it was my father 's . it 's temperamental .
oh , go on . have one . fuck it . you think you 're going to live forever ?
i 'm trying to quit .
great . thanks . you gon na have one ?
i know what you 're saying but ... never ? you 've never had a dream ? no , you know , you do . you must . what you mean is you do n't remember them .
no ... i mean , it 's not like great about your dad or anything . it 's just i do n't dream . never have . ... maybe it 'd help if i slept sometime ... just kidding ... no , so it 's always neat for me to hear about dreams . i 'm jealous . it 's like everybody has another world except me . you know what i mean ?
what ?
that 's great .
god , no ! nothing like that . no , he died before i was born . he died in vietnam . i never knew him . never met him . we do n't even know the details . i dream of battlefields . of searching . of trying to find out .
oh , right . did he used to ... ?
no . no , it 's ok. i ... it 's my father .
sorry .
why are you so interested ?
what is it ?
... well , i 've been having it for years . it 's not a nightmare or anything . it 's ... well , i know what it is .
oh yeah ...
your dream . you said you were having a bad dream .
what ?
right .
i put some decaf on . er ... make yourself comfortable .
no . no . it 's fine . come now . i was having bad dreams anyway .
of course tonight . is that a problem ? like , if you 've got a guy there or something ...
yeah . sure . you mean ... tonight ?
oh yeah . yeah . well ... look , i 'll make a deal with you ... my boyfriend threw me out , right ? i 'll trade you . you give me couch-space . i 'll give you talk . ok ?
i want to talk to you . we met ... now , listen , do n't hang up , ok ? ... we met at the hospital last night .
right ... so ... well , what do you want ?
right . right !
you like ... left me a card ? at the club ?
joey . yeah , who is this ?
uh ... hi ! is this ... er ... joanne summerskill ?
uh-huh ?
under the underground ? what 's that ? where is ...
under the underground . can i like go now ? !
where ?
look , lady ! i told you ! it 's not my problem ! i was just there !
it 's nothing to do with me . i was n't even with him .
hold on . hold on , please . i need talk to you .
what happened to him ?
it was off the statue . in the club .
right at the back there . middle shelves . coupla folders . nice stuff . i 'd do you a good price .
i do n't know . maybe .
you gon na buy ?
can we see ?
sure . just papers , photos . stuff nobody 'd ever want .
what else came with it ? anything still here ?
it was part of a job-lot . some loony- bin they shut down . unclaimed stuff .
fine . fine . but can you tell us anything about it ?
never mind . i 'm glad it 's gone . made the store feel strange . who 'd make such a thing ?
i took back everything bought on a whim , i 'd have no business . i ...
no . we want ...
everything sold as is . no guarantees . no returns .
no . no , you do n't understand . we 're not selling it . it came from here . we want ...
no . sorry . not interested . not for my customers . have you tried ...
right . like you were hog-tied or something .
you ... i ca n't fucking believe you , you bastard ! you get me in here ...
i 'm jp monroe , you stupid little bitch . now get the fuck out of my life .
you shit . who do you think you are ?
and tomorrow i 'll give one to somebody else . get dressed . get out .
but you gave me a rose ...
oh . like i 'm not an interesting person .
it does n't bother me . i 'm just not interested .
unh-unh .
do you mind me talking about your stuff ?
no . thank you .
wow . thank you .
yes really .
no . really ?
... let it define you . whatever it is . most of the roses die behind the bar . this is the first i 've given out for nearly a month .
do n't do that ! do n't put yourself down . if you have a quality , be proud of it ...
oh come on . there 're lots of girls here who look better than ...
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar . and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty .
i 'm sorry .
he 's a barman . whatever . do you mind if i continue ?
the barman ? i thought he was called rick ?
you see , everyday i have my friend john here bring ...
a prize ? for what ?
it 's yours . you won it . it 's a prize .
thank you for the drink . and the rose . wow . that 's ... really nice .
thank you .
and this is your club . great club . i really love it here . great club .
uh-huh .
you 're jp monroe , right ?
welcome . 38
it has already begun .
how do we start ?
god ? my god was diamond and black light . and i was his dark pope . all that is changed . a terrible beauty is born . with a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes .
but how in god 's name ...
you see , we 're not so dissimilar .
hey , that 's what makes the world go round .
a dark star rising . i was bound to another 's system by a soul i once possessed . a friend relieved me of that inconvenience . now i 'm free . born again of blood and desire .
because you want to . you 've always wanted to . look at your pictures . look at your sculptures . look at those tawdry representations and then ... imagine . imagine a world of the body as canvas . the body as clay . your will and mine as the brush and the knife . oh , i have such sights to show you .
what ! ? what are you talking about ? why should i help you ?
do n't flee from yourself . if you have a quality , let it define you . cultivate it . it is you . by helping me , you will help yourse ...
fuck you !
i understand . their fortune was so tempting , their affection so conditional . what else could you do ?
no ! no . it 's not the same ... i ... no . what you did ... it was ... evil .
good . so did i. and that 's all ...
yes .
on the contrary . it has everything to do with the world . and our dreams of how it will succumb to us . you enjoyed the girl ?
that had nothing to do with the world . not this one , anyway .
what did you see ? the same as i. appetite sated . desire indulged . you saw the working of the world in miniature .
what ... what ... ?
yes ! god , yes . i ... i just want to hug you . to hold you . to tell you it 's alright .
really ?
hey , you did n't fuck it up with me . you know that . it was my fault , babe , it really was . and you know i 'm sorry . and i 'm sorry to see you upset now . i hate to see you in pain like this .
no . it is n't ... she would n't ... it 's like i must have done something wrong , you know ? freaked her out . just fucked up something good again .
that 's terrible . what a bitch . she was obviously just using you , terri . ready to dump you the second she had what she needed , interfering little whore .
sure . sure . i understand . it 's cool . i mean , we 've got all night .
i do n't think so . not yet . i 'm not ready yet .
terri , listen . why do n't you come here and kiss me ? i mean , it 's probably ticking away in both our minds , right ? is it going to happen ? is n't it going to happen ? let 's get it out of the way . see how we feel . then we can relax . talk . you know .
yeah right . look ...
not now , no . i mean - now that you 're here , it 's like she does n't even exist , you know what i mean ?
a girl ? anyone i should know ?
yeah , a girl i know helped smarten it up . put her heart and soul into it .
yeah ... yeah , it looks different .
no . but , as you can see , i 'm having some work done on it . you found a real treasure for me , terri . i hope i can show you how grateful i am .
not quite . this was n't here .
c'mon . it 'll be great .
oh , i do n't ...
good ... good ... look , why do n't you come over ? you know , nothing heavy , little drink maybe , little talk . just see how we both feel ?
yes . 53
that 's so good to hear , sweetheart . it really is . you know , i .. are you alone ?
i miss you too .
i know . i know . it 's bad . i 'm a bad person . but i try not to be , terri . i really do . and i really miss you .
well ... of course i have . i 've thought . i 've ... oh , jp , you were so horrible . you really hurt me ...
hey , it has been known . c'mon terri , i 'm not that bad a guy . i have regrets . i 'd like to put things right . do n't tell me you have n't thought about me . huh ?
you 're apologizing ?
no . i mean , really ? because i 'm concerned for you , sweetheart . i care about you . i guess i miss you . i 'm sorry we split up . i 'm sorry i ...
yeah really . i 'm ...
really ?
oh . yeah . yeah . well ... i 'm fine . things are great here . joey 's going to get me a job at the tv station . i 'm meeting lotsa new people . it 's really great .
will you relax ? your little girlfriend left a card , remember ?
yeah right . how 'd you get this number ?
what do you want ?
live and in the flesh . how 're you doing , babe ?
jp ?
not quite .
joey ?
guards come exactly every three minutes ... .
eighth room down , babe ...
gum .
delivery entrance . low security .
it does n't have to be . everybody knows that if you mess with the kremlin , you 'll end up in a siberian gulag eating your own fingernails .
the security 's actually not that severe .
i laughed , i cried .
that was beautiful .
hudson , god 's given you a gift for cat burglary , you can t just ...
well , forget about it . hawk and i are going to rio . we 're hurt , we 're tired , and a hero ai n't nothing but a sandwich . right , buddy ? ...
something like that .
you 're saying you want us to beat them to the crystal and save the world from financial disarray .
it was so beautiful ! when the blanks went off , they ...
oh thank god , you 're dead ...
get em ... .
let 's just forget it , i mean ...
get 'em . they went down the hallway .
you 're a reed , man . i got ta get anna . hang in there ...
i ca n't believe you did n't notice . my weight . i lost ten pounds in rome
alex , are you ... .
i do n't want to sound immature , but we were here first ...
i 'm a ghost . boo .
`` but we 'll be the same as we started ...
`` we all had our quarrels and parted ... ''
you can be lookout ! ... .. take alex 's gun .
anna , i think you better stay ... .
that was close ... .
`` how 'd we ever get such in a ru-utt ''
`` oh this lock is a pain in the bu-utt ''
do n't worry , we 'll get it ...
now that 's a lock .
`` maybe we 're ragged and funny . ''
`` oh , we ai n't got a barrel of money .
okay .
why not just go now ?
count of three ?
yeah , i mean , come on , going through the iron curtain is supposed to be crawling underneath barbed wire , it 's supposed to be strangling a guard ...
you sound disappointed .
shwoof , that makes me feel better . i ca n't believe this is the iron curtain . all the guy at airport customs wanted to know was `` who shot j.r. ? ''
geez , this art treasures room looks like a burnt diaphragm .
we 're going in from the ground floor .
damn travel agency . that kremlin thing is in moscow , is n't it ?
rio , alex ? after all they 've done to ... hey , these tickets are for moscow !
do n't act like you 've never committed a crime before , hawkins ? i know , i made call , when anna tracked me down i ...
no sweat , alex , you only made the biggest mistake of < u > my < /u > life . what was your per-diem ?
but i said i was sorry ... .
you bastard . you fucked my freedom for a lousy job .
alex , my man , it 's time to play a little offense . where 's your tux ?
you re not thinking of going to ...
because i 'm tired of not understanding things . cops , mafia , and butlers forcing me to bust my ass to steal something , which it turns out i really did n't steal -- it 's fucked up .
why try ?
boing . uh , this i don t understand ...
`` attempted . '' at-tempt-ted ! i 'm not happy about having to steal that horse , but i do have my pride . face it , when it comes to burglary , and sex , i ... .
morning edition . seems two thieves `` attempted '' to steal it last night , but thanks to three `` courageous '' guards , it will be ready for tonight .
okay , you got me , mr. pbs .
ah yes , a rare renaissance piece . da vinci 's `` sforza , '' an equestrian model of a never executed statue . i consider it to be the prize of tonight 's auction of objets d'equestrian . horse things .
the butler did it . guy was a cross between alistair cook and a cuisinart . dude took mr. ed and humptied dumptied it over gates 's head . he said it was made by , get this , leonardo..
geez , gates was killed . who do we send the thank you note to ?
oh , not much . gates just had his tonsils taken out . the hard way .
did i miss anything ?
paint a woman in a lighthou -- i do n't want to steal a horse . life is ...
`` you could be swinging on a star . ''
what am i doing here ? there are so many things i wan na do that are n't this . paint a lighthouse . kiss a woman in italy .
the song 's over ! come on ! `` you could be swinging on a star . ''
`` every day you meet quite a few . ''
`` and all the monkeys are n't in the zoo . ''
`` and though he 's slippery , he still gets caught . ''
`` he ca n't write his name or read a book . to fool people is his only thought . ''
`` he kicks up at anything he hears .
`` a mule is an animal with long funny ears . ''
you know they invented something while you were inside . called a watch .
5:32 . `` swinging on a star . ''
you got about five minutes and change .
yes , master-thief , i can see that . you said something about a plan ...
they record everything their video surveillance takes in ...
no need . guards ' station 's right there .
cameras ?
hey , you promised ... ... do n't worry , i 'm wearing my girdle .
whoa , you better cut a bigger hole than that .
do n't wet your diapers . i 'll have to change them . `` witchcraft . '' what 's the running time ?
alex !
rutherford auction ... that name ...
i 'm sorr -- goddamn mario brothers . goddamn gates . goddamn rutherford auction house . by the way , how many seconds ?
you 're not ... listening !
there goes five seconds ... my record 's eighteen .
this is n't funny . i 'm not into this . i ...
hey , i 'm sorry , man . i 'm putting out a fire with kerosene .
but you got three guards who ... shit , what am i doing ? where 's the want ads ? gon na sell some spatulas .
just means it 'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce . you re still the best , i know it .
the safe 's a simpson 71. last time i played the game , simpson only had a 40 .
hmmm , nasty little safe on the 7th .
it 's captain bob 's steering wheel ! remember when the captain ... ..
yo pandora , quit hummm-ing ... look at this .
hmmmm ... ..
sure . that 's why his meatballs are made out of marinated chuck wagon .
alex , did you know this ape was going to be here ...
hey , get this irritable guy a cappuccino . i got ta go be a boss .
i read about these people in newsweek . where 's all the regulars , crazy jeff cava , the todd sisters , indian joe ? where 's ed kranepool 's autograph ? captain bob 's steering wheel ?
i did n't know how to tell you . a couple brokers stopped in for stoley spritzers one night . next thing i know fast track digest votes us `` watering hole of the month . '' now , i 'm shopping for aqua salmon wallpaper .
ah , had the perfect amount of foam . just get me to the bar ... it 's the one good thing in my life that 'll never change ... .
those dago-guinea-i can say this shit i 'm italian-wop motherfu --
oh , not much . mario brothers want me to do a job .
so mr. coffee , what went down outside the prison ?
oh man , you still got a thing for those unmasculine european coffees ? who 's your buddy ?
come on , alex , let 's just get to alex 's . your bar 's the only place that 's going to cheer me . god , i 'd kill for a damn cappuccino . what the hell 's a nintendo ?
now that you 're born again , what do you wan na do ? statue of liberty ? entertain some ladies ? miss saigon tix ? seduce some women ? play nintendo ? bone some chicks ?
not anymore . now i 'm the laziest damn cat burg -- i 'm going to take it so straight that i wo n't tape a mets game without the expressed written consent of the national baseball league .
still do the puzzles , still know the running times of songs , and i 'll bet you 're still the best damn cat burg --
three minutes , 51 seconds .
show off . hey , boss tune . `` come fly with me . ''
that 's your definition of `` hard ? ''
my next word was gon na be `` consciousness . '' swear to god ... tubby .
do n't say it , hawkins . i 'm incredibly sensitive about my fucking figure .
looks like you 've been expanding your ...
lousy day ? the man 's getting out of prison and he 's having a lousy day . what , you missing out on the cell block water ballet pageant ? believe me , it 's overrated .
your timing , and your shoes , are impeccable ... good to see you , alex , been having a lousy day .
that 's the first thing i did . smooch the ground and taste the freedom . sorry i was late . miss anything ?
ooh-kay ...
my plan is just beginning . i 'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers , but i 'm afraid the birth of the new british empire can have no witnesses !
you 're unemployed , alfie . boss is dead . her plan is over .
how .
last rites , sister ?
welcome back to vinci .
it 's boston , mr. mayflower .
my life is not some deal . i ...
yes way .
welcome to rome , sir .
too-do-loo , babe .
ta ta , hudson hawk .
as for our plan of action , anybody 'd be insane to go in from the ground floor ...
lucky for us , the da vinci is located in a wing of the kremlin that they used to throw the miss ukraine pageant and stuff . it 'll have the least number of guards ... .
close call , but she 's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious vatican organization . hawk , it 's time to go to the principal 's office ... .
with all due respect to that great blouse , why did n't i cut out her heart ?
snickers , make the list happen . oh and it 's one thing to play hide and seek with the mayflower 's pathetic staff , but we 're sore losers . i 've put jumper cables on the nipples of children and not always in the line of duty .
grapple , biker 's bottle , hairspray , black turtleneck , pocket fisherman , acid , collapsible yardstick , softball , and 72 stamps . gee stud , this is going to be some date . no harvey 's bristol cream ?
i call them the mtv.i.a . punks think bay of pigs is an herbal tea . they think the cold war involves penguins and ...
george , you promised . no old cia/ new cia jokes ...
do n't you just hate kids ...
you 're supposed to be dead !
what the hell ... .
snickers , baby , i love you like a brother , but really , who cares ? silencer bomb ...
this is the room above the art treasures room . the lock is a natalya z-z , first created ...
quit bitching , you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit ... ah to be in pari-is and in love .
damn baby , when 's the last time you had a vacation ... jesus , i got ta get out of this job . if my mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-apartheid movement ... .
italy , france , moscow . they all just wan na be nebraska . old man kaplan thinks since communism is dead , we got nothing to do . man , democracy is n't free elections . we got ta teach the world that democracy is big tits , college football on saturdays , eddie murphy saying the word `` fuck '' and kids putting their hands down garbage disposals on `` america 's funniest home videos . ''
actually we 're in italy , snickers , she said as if it made a difference .
come on , pierre , steak-bur-ger , fren-n-ch fries . this is france , you got ta have french ... ..
god go with you , sister .
i know , i know , your eminence , just say `` god go with me . ''
i 'm sorry for losing it back there , but you must remember , sister , you have vows to god as well as a mission to the world .
i 'm going to find out .
oh , why could n't i be the cardinal in charge of catering ... . if the mayflowers get the three sections of da vinci 's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine -- aie-yi -- do we got anything ? what of alex , hawk 's friend , where is his loyalty ?
you got it . operation deflower mayflower is a bad joke and i 'm the punchline . i thought we were using the cia to help us to get mayflower , but really the cia was using me to keep us away from mayflower .
sorry . seventeen hail marys and five minutes outside .
a little petting is not the issue !
`` messed around '' messed around ? i know -- i do n't want to know . first base ? second base ? stop me when i 'm getting warm ...
he came into a world where crime is a legitimate business tactic and a legitimate government procedure . but he knew right and wrong . oh , and we kind of messed around ...
anna , what are you trying to say ...
i betrayed a man . a good man . an innocent man . a thief .
hit me with your best shot .
yeah . the big e .
let me be the one to quote scripture . ... .as an agent of our organization , you are put in awkward situations . just remember , hudson hawk is an evil , evil man .
that 's the best kind . a wise woman once said `` polite conversation is rarely either . ''
attempt , you mean . the vanity of this man , hudson hawk . the vatican has foiled the advances of pirates and terrorists . we will not lie down for some schmuck from new jersey . must you flirt with him so realistically ?
no , your eminence . i think he 's going to steal the codex , as early as next week .
did he mention the mayflowers ?
i got my planet back .
hudson , i 'm afraid i 'm sticking with god . but you 're a close second , tough guy . what is that smile ?
have i ever told you the world is beautiful ... i 'd really like to play nintendo with you , or something ...
holy sh-h -- things are going to get very interesting , very fast . da vinci would be proud of you .
i wan na know ...
wha -- you do n't want to know ...
yeah , but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal .
da vinci made the real directions in a secret script that i decoded . the way the machine is running now , the gold will produce too quickly , clog , and the machine will shut itself down . is n't it wonderful ?
wha ... ..
trust leonardo ... .
i hope you know what ... .
this is too bad to be false .
oh hudson , i 'm a sister of the catholic church as well as an agent .
i told you not to call me hudson . the only people who called me that were the nuns at ...
oh hudson ...
fits my new image . a thief for the masses . this is one job i 'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying . gum .
uh , yeah . guess i 'm a wee bit nervous . i 'm sorry i could only score clergy passports .
hey , do n't take your disguise so seriously .
you re not `` some guy '' anymore , hudson . right now , you 're the only guy . without your help , i ... .
selfish attitude ? i 'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up , not too much foam ...
it 's that kind of selfish attitude that ...
you better believe i can . i 'm sick of people telling me what i have to do .
it 's from the machine . all they need is the crystal to run it and they have 2/3 of it already . we ca n't let that happen .
you know , the place where you gave the bad guys the codex ... . the mayflower museum .
where did you get this ?
oh . well , what 's this ?
i-work-for-a-covert-vatican-humanitarian- organization . the-cia-made-a-fool-of-me . i-care-for-you ...
and you , dr. cappucino , you 're lucky i do n't hit women , assuming you are a woman . i 'm not taking anything for granted anymore .
hudson , do n't you understand ...
oh , i must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it .
this does n't taste like cappuccino .
ooh , i guess i do know something here 's looking at you , kid ...
the c.i . what ? god , no ...
does everyone in the world know more than me ? jesus , i 'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff ... ..lifted a piece of licorice when i was one and a half . who knew it would lead ... they even got the cia involved !
for two years , i 've been tracking the mayflowers ' peculiar interest in three da vinci pieces . their sforza replica was as fake as the `` gas leak '' that supposedly destroyed it .
what are your plans for the weekend ? hoisting away the colosseum ? tell me , did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower ?
wha --
you really went and did it . with one day , not even a day , of planning , you did it . nobody does it better , hudson . you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex .
it 's not what you think . okay , maybe it is ... .
oh . no .
somebody robbed the vatican .
catholic girls are scary ...
it 's also been a long time for me . i --
hey now , outside of a very friendly dog this morning , it 's been a slow decade . i do n't make love every ten years , i get a little cranky .
i 'm sorry . i ca n't . i ... .
oh , i 'm so sorry ...
tickles , tickles , tickles .
uh ... .old badminton injury .
what have you been doing ?
i seem to have a thing for sinning . sinning . check please ... .
wow , you were `` in the joint . '' `` doing hard time . '' it 's funny , but that excites me . i seem to have a thing for sinners .
let 's just say , i never saw e.t .
how long were you in ?
i was the warden ?
prison ?
this is bueno . they had the worst ketchup in prison ... ..uh ...
i never break a date . scout 's honor .
oh hudson , i was worried you were n't going to drop by ... .
said .
secret passageways do n't mean as much as they used to . there 's a place two blocks east of here . enzo 's . say 10:30 .
and i 'll bring my entourage ...
i 'll bring my entire repertoire ...
god , i wish i could say the same thing . what about having a nice , dull dinner with me tonight . scrabble , knock-knock jokes , anecdotes about famous dead italians ... .
i do n't steal stuffed elephants from little girls . and i buy my own clothes . my life 's a little boring ...
you 're not an unmysterious thang yourself .
actually i wrote it . it 's a good sentence . it can apply to people .
oh , you read that .
nice . but right out of our brochure .
the vatican is made of constant mysteries meant to be enjoyed , not explained .
delivers up to ten at night . the pope has an obsession with his easter seals . it 's actually not that an unusual set-up . the secret passageway on the other hand ... .
whoa , part 2. does it go to times square ?
could you believe that crazy elephant ?
sure hudson . are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on dumbo ?
whoa . name 's hawkins , eddie hawkins . my nickname 's hudson hawk , but do n't call me hudson , not even as a joke . the nuns at st. agnes called me that and they 're the ones who helped make me what i am today . not a compliment ...
never , why do you ask ?
come on , this stuff will knock you out . have you ever had the feeling you were being followed , mr. bond .
question , sir ? his untiring pen predicted the airplane , the submarine , the bicycle , the helicopter , and even the tank .
that 's what you theenk .
as you know , the da vinci codex , has lived in the vatican for centuries and will continue to live here for centuries more .
yes , and my giraffe loves it , too ...
tough guy . what are you -- how 's your head .
because danger , doc , is my middle ...
thanks tough guy , thanks a lot . why was the guard chasing you ?
excuse me , milady . i would have flown over and carried you up to a pink cloud , but i left my cape at the cleaners .
no , i meant you did n't have to tackle me and rip my dress . a polite push , perhaps ? a clear shout of `` watch out , anna '' would have done nicely ...
forget about it -- it was nothing -- anybody would have done the same thing -- it 's an impulse ...
my god , that was bold of you , you did n't have to do that ...
fantastic . perfection . the vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder .
oh , the shit is going to hit the fa --
actually he never told us what it was .
cat got his tongue ?
anna . anna . anna . if that were true , almond joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the codex . now , get some sleep . kit kat ...
oh lord ... . the only reason i ask is that hudson , uh , mr. hawk , hawkins , had some `` neat '' things to say about darwin , minerva , and you . basically that you 're part of the same car pool .
it 's the site of their new museum and we 're taking it over . operation deflower mayflower is going full speed ahead .
and then we 'll arrest those greedy pigs ... is that it ?
when the mayflowers find out we have the codex , they 're going to want to make a deal ...
way to go , anna .
ah , the mafia , the cops ; do i know how to party or what ?
good job , not pretty , but good .
baseball , why ?
what 's your favorite sport , hawk ?
if the mario brothers were n't jersey 's third largest family , i 'd say kiss my ass . but considering your status , i 'll say slurp my butt .
hawk , you 're a great thief . got set up , did some time , nothing to be ashamed of . do n't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down , open a hardware store and sell spatulas ...
or you cut off my thingie . directions even your brother would understand .
you 're hitting rutherford 's auction house . easy as my brother 's wife . directions are in the bag . just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie ...
sure . face down . two endearing shots to the back of the head . that 's your mark , man . what did little eddie ever do to ...
how many times do i have to say it ? i did n't put the hit on little eddie ... never had anything against that kooky chimp . i actually found him , `` endearing . ''
million five , lover ...
that new-york-italian-father- made-twenty-bucks-a-week-son- of-a-bitch . what was our bet ? a million ?
i knew it ! i told you it was a fake .
so let 's get busy . have some fun and make some deals .
we 're here to say , your government was right .
i look at you soviet people and i feel ... pity ... superiority . most of your life , your government has told you that capitalism turns people into robots who 'd rather eat microwave sushi , naked in the back of a cadillac than hear the laughter of children .
well , that said , the last ingredient in the recipe is in , get this , you 're gon na die , the kremlin .
market crashes . bomb drops . greenhouse effect affects . we 'll still be the richest , most powerful people in the world . in 1992 , europe is coming together to become one business superpower . it 's one party we 'd love to poop .
alchemy ! is the business term of the 90 's , my man ! minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago . i dumped some lira into research ... shazam , we come across a diary by one of da vinci 's apprentices detailing la machine de oro , the gold machine for those at home , and the rest is about to become history . money is n't everything , gold is . fuck blue chip stocks ! fuck t-bills ! fuck junk bonds ! i got the real deal ! money will always be paper but gold will always be gold !
surely a master-thief like you can tell the difference .
so , captain hawk , in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou . in the autre , you got lead that wo n't get you gelato .
i do n't care .
no , let me !
like a `` cat '' , one could say .
have n't you ever seen , like david niven ? you know tiptoe in , tiptoe out .
bunny , ball-ball ! bad bunny !
listen hawk , this might be hard to believe , but i 'm a regular joe . i just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals . it 's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19 , it 's hard to keep coming up with new ones . but now finally i got my new goal . world domination . with your help ... bunny ... .quit that !
we want da vinci 's sketchbook , what do they call it , the codex .
that 's two hundred dollars a day ? so he can get a hooker and some tequila . veto , darwin .
hawkmeister , we got you clothes , great hotel , and a 250,000 lira per diem .
poor baby ... .. here , bunny .
outbid by my own wench , quelle bummere .
but you 're going to tell us anyway ...
what a pleasant surprise . you 're probably wondering ...
you want an address on that last one ?
i 'll torture you so slowly you 'll think it 's a career ! i 'll kill your family , your friends , and the bitch you took to the prom !
hey , guys , i 've always wanted to sing like franki valli and the other seasons , but come on ... .
come to think of it there is a part of your body that you wo n't need for your next job ...
i guess that 's a no .
way to go , alfie ! how many people did you break that thing in front of . good help 's hard to find .
if you 're pausing for a `` thank you , '' give it up . so boss , you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means ?
oh ... let 's see . there are organizations that think we wanted the `` sforza '' for reasons other than putting it in the da vinci museum we 're building in vinci . hopefully , these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica . if i seem vague , grand . we want a low profile on this , that 's why i got kaplan and the candy bars involved . i helped george help the mario brothers and gates help get you out ... .
whatever . you own boardwalk , you own park place , you own the four railroads . you think you 're god . for all i know , you 're probably right . i just wanted to have a damn cappuccino , maybe play some nintendo after i find out what it is . man , why did n't you just < u > buy < /u > the horse ? what am i saying , you did buy it ...
so hawkasaurus , i wo n't mince words ...
because i did n't want to get hurt , taterhead .
you could host american bandstand in here . why did you duck at the auction , asshole ?
for those kind of wages , i could have built the factory in america ! they 're vietnamese , ca n't we just give them more bart simpson shirts ? i hear depressing news like this and i want to commit genocide ! alfred , hold my calls . so , hawk ! the hawkster ! what do you think of the vehicle ?
so when 's that sebastian-cabot- buckingham-palace-looking- butlerhead getting here ?
you certainly do .
all this trouble for a horsey . i may not know art , but i know what i like .
were n't you the bartender at jonestown ?
hudson hawkins gets the chair of honor . how about a gates-arita ? i used real hot dogs .
that 's the beauty . it 's bullshit , but i can make it stick because i 'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who 's about to find out that there 's a thin line between ex-con and escape con .
what else do you got under there ... i do n't want to be rude , but this is all pretty lame .
uh , yeah . cut to the chase .
remember that shoe you lost ...
yes .
remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself ?
how was i supposed to know they were women ? besides one of them was bald and kept saying `` soitinly . ''
you would n't be out if it was n't for me ! i did dog and pony for you ! you think they would have let you out after what you did , you told the board members they looked like the three stooges ...
the only thing you ca n't do is get sex for free . i know i was in prison for like basically the 80 's , but , call me daffy , are n't you supposed to < u > stop < /u > me from committing crimes . you know , book-em-dano , call-for-backup , give-a-hoot-don't-pollute .
the auction house , asshole . one night 's work and you 're free like no ex-con 's ever been . no checking in with a shrink , no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey . it 's a great deal , i ca n't lie .
what job ?
why do you show your parole officer such disrespect ? especially after i got you such a nice job .
the pleasure 's all yours , officer gates .
have a seat . good to see you , buddy ol ' pal ...
i killed some lovable working class italian-diabetic , but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind , gentle lover . so do n't play with me .
and to think i thought you were evil incarnate in pumps .
if you pull this off , i ca n't promise i wo n't kill you . i mean , who we trying to kid ? but i will spare the flying nun here ... .
you ca n't , convict ! you 're just a shmoe ! every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them . it rains , car crash stops traffic , you say `` how could this happen to me ? '' it 's a natural inclination . but for i , this is n't a fantasy , it is < u > reality < /u > ! you are on my planet ! you walk around the corner for coffee , out of my sight , you do not fucking exist ! the lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich , to the powerful , to me !
except yours-yours . the goal of world domination . well , if you put it that way , minnie . how can i resist ?
it 'll take a couple of years of steady production , but i 'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself , the foundation of all finance , will lose its meaning . brokers , economists , and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns . markets will crash- crash . financial empires will crumble-crumble .
you killed a friend . why should i help you go for the gold ?
if you think you 're getting past me ...
i hate a man with a sense of humor . while you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity , we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way : a thoroughly corrupt business deal .
you 've got a dilemma , tiger . i think i know what 's going to help you solve it .
bunny , not you too ?
jail , you asshole ! our foot soldiers will blow your brains out ! bunny , ball-ball !
sure . the kremlin . makes sense . the kremlin . why not ? listen , this is all too indiana jones and the lost city of king tut for me , man . throw me in jail and go ahead , just try and throw alex ...
alchemy .
cool , is n't it ? weight , feel , mal1eability , they 're all but identical . on the periodic chart of elements , they 're but one proton apart . great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless .
two minutes , 35 seconds . damnit , i 'm involved in this thing , so i just wan na know what this thing is . i wan na be treated as an adult .
big girls do n't cry-i-eye .
just browsing . do n't touch me ... .
get away from there , convict !
you would n't risk the dime to call the police . you have no proof .
you go back , you wo n't be alone . you 'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate . you 're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes , but `` alex '' will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it 'll be to attend his own funeral . depressing .
anybody have a cigarette ? but seriously , do me a favor and concorde me back to prison . i do n't care anymore . i hope you have the receipts for the threads .
for god 's sake , chain this convict .
guess i know who wears the penis in this family .
too bad .
damnit , i hate this ! i 'm a cat burglar ! nobody said anything about this fight-to-the-death shit .
just shut up and hit me !
bastard ! if you were a true american .
do n't be stupid ... they ...
tonight ? you 're whacked . the timing 's off , i 'm underequipped damnit , i have a date !
good news , bud , the mayflowers have moved up the time-table . you 're hitting the vatican to-night .
you know kaplan , if you were n't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived , i 'd feel sorry for you .
when it rains , it pours . name 's snickers . the plane leaves in 40 .
this is the worst night ...
tell me about it ...
why does this have to be so hard ...
no . but why do you let butterfinger keep those blood stains on his shirt ?
i ca n't believe this . i 'm in fucking russia , or do i have to say , the fucking soviet union and i 'm shooting a non-bolshevick . i never thought i 'd say `` i 'm just in this job for the money . '' sad . any last immature quips ?
i do n't think you 'll appreciate their choice of weenie .
they may be scum , but if i get the da vinci model back , then we 'll be roasting weenies on the beach .
ca n't you see the mayflowers double-crossed you ...
yeah , right . by the way , as long as i 'm getting things off my chest , i 'm the one who killed your little monkey . made it look like a mafia hit . did it for fun . ciao .
if you do anything to my friend ...
we blow up space shuttles for breakfast . you and your friend alex would be a late afternoon triscuit .
thanks for sharing .
god , i miss communism . the red threat . people were scared , the agency was respected , and i got laid every night .
why george , you big softie ...
hawk , hawk , hawk . enjoying italy ? i always had a soft spot for rome . did my first barehanded strangulation here . communist politician .
shucks . guess not .
i 'm supposed to fall for that ?
no , somebody powerful . oh . look . what 's that up there ?
employer ? the president ?
hush . my employer wants a meeting .
three minutes , twenty-three seconds . if you think i 'm doing another ...
i want to make things up to you . that 's why i got you this gig , doll . hawk , my name 's george kaplan and to quote the late , great karen carpenter , `` we 've only just begun . ''
to what do i owe the dishonor of a reunion , you centrally intelligent scumsicle .
i used you as a diversion . while you were getting captured upstairs , i was shredding documents in the basement . deep down , i guess i was just jealous . you were one incredible thief ...
but i 'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge .
bastard , you 're going to need another nose !
you just might . i 'm the guy who tricked you into robbing a government installation and then had you sent to prison for it . at the time , i was bald with a beard , no moustache , and i had a different nose , so if you do n't recognize me , i wo n't be offended .
do n't i know you ...
the hudsucker hoop !
the hoop-dee-doo !
the hudswinger !
the hoopsucker !
the circle-o'-gaiety !
the daddy-oh !
the hipster !
the shazzammeter !
with a little jazz .
snappy .
sharp .
something short .
the jerky circle !
the dancing dingus !
we 'll call it the flying donut !
cheap ! cheap ! it 's never been more valuable ! and i 'm ruined ! ruined !
sure , sure , we 'd all be millionaires . there 's no point in looking back . at the time , stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market , further depress the stock -- then we 'd buy it all back , and more of course , once it got cheap --
i had twenty thousand shares ! i 'd be a millionaire now !
we dumped the whole load . now quit showboating , addison --
nobody told me ! nobody told me ! you sold all of our stock ?
he did n't look unhappy !
what am i a headshrinker ? maybe the man was unhappy .
my god , why ? ! why did he do it ? ! things were going so well !
them po ' young folks . looks like norville 's in fo ' the same kind o ' heartache ol ' warin ' had . but then , she never axed me 'bout dat ...
... hello ?
i 'm plenty happy !
okay , miss archuh . ... i got gears to see to .
i 'm happy enough .
i do n't mean that ! why you pretendin ' to be such a hard ol ' sourpuss ! ai n't never gon na make you happy ! never made warin ' happy .
well , in connection with my job , sometimes i have to go undercover as it were --
why you do n't even know y'own self -- you ai n't exactly the genuine article are you , miss archuh ?
it 's hardly the same --
an ' only some kind a knucklehead thinks she knows things 'bout things she , uh -- when she do n't , uh -- how 'd that go ?
well , maybe i --
... but i guess you do n't really know him any better than that board does , do ya , miss archuh ?
'cause they 's little pigglies ! they 's tryin ' to inspire panic , make that stock git cheap so 's they can snitch it all up fo ' themselves ! but norville , he 's got some tricks up his sleeve , he does ...
why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president ?
but then i figured it out : they did it 'cause they figured young norville for an imbecile . like some othuh people ah know .
that smart ? !
well , that even surprised ole moses at fust . i did n't think the board was that smart .
so if you know everything about hudsucker , tell me why the board decided to make norville barnes president .
i do n't tell no one nothin ' lessen they ask . thatches ai n't ole moses ' way .
yeah , yeah . say , you wo n't tell anyone about me , will you ?
ah keeps the ol ' circle turning -- this ol ' clock needs plenty o ' care . time is money , miss archuh , and money -- it drives that ol ' global economy and keeps big daddy earth a-spinnin ' on 'roun ' . ya see , without that capital fo'mation --
but -- who are you -- what d'you do here ?
ah guess ole moses knows jes about ever'thing , leastways if it concerns hudsuckuh .
who are you ? how did you know who i am ?
muncie !
you 've lost it , aim . you 've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from dubuque --
yeah , and i 'll bet his initials are sidney j. mussburger !
but , al , it 's the bunk ! norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day i met him ! why buzz could n't have invented it -- look at the man -- he 's an imbecile !
-- and she 's dynamite !
i know they 're gon na buy that stock --
ol ' satchel-butt ...
on norville barnes !
ten dollars ? let 's grab a highball !
a sawbuck !
he did n't offer you money .
i 'm tellin ' ya , this guy 's just the patsy and i 'm gon na find out what for . there 's a real story , smitty , some kind of plot , a setup , a cabal , a -- oh , and say , did i tell ya ? !
yeah , i was all wet about your idea man ... well , thanks for being so generous ... it is human , and you are divine ... no , he 's no faker . he 's the 100 % real mccoy beware-of- imitations genuine article : the guy is a real moron --
about seven minutes .
yeah .
i 'm telling you , smitty , the board of hudsucker is up to something --
lumbago .
adenoids ?
and is this guy from chumpsville ? ! i pulled the old mother routine --
well that just about does it ! i 've seen norville barnes , the young man in a big hurry , and i 've seen norville barnes the self-important heel , but i 've never seen norville barnes the quitter , and i do n't like it !
aww , what 's the difference . i 'm all washed up ... when you 're dead , ya stay dead ... hey , fella !
just give me another chance , norville -- i can help you fight this thing . i know this last story was a lie ! we can prove it ! we can --
hey ! where 's that martini ? !
norville , i 'm sorry , i ... i tried to tell you ... so many times ... it 's hard to admit when you 've been wrong . if you could just ... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
barman ! set 'm up , fella !
oh norville , i --
... oh , it 's you ! lookin ' for a nitwit to buy your lunch ? !
huh ? !
norville !
... you son of a --
consider this my resignation --
now , amy --
worked in a watch factory ?
shutup ! -- after all ! you have n't talked to me for a week and now i 'm going to say my piece . i 've got a prediction for you , norville barnes : i predict that since you 've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad , you 're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you . you 're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a board that would n't give you the time of day if you ... if you ...
now , aim --
shutup ! -- but then i figured out you were a swell guy , a little slow maybe , but a swell guy ! well , maybe you 're not so slow , but you 're not so swell either and it looks like you 're an imbecile after --
now , aim --
shutup ! -- and do n't think i have n't noticed how you 've changed . i used to think you were a swell guy -- well , to be honest i thought you were an imbecile --
now , aim --
... i 've been watching you , norville barnes , even though you 've been trying to avoid me --
you 're awful kind to yourself , norville barnes -- the fact is you 've slowed down , sitting up here like a sultan , not doing a lick of work ! why you know it 's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you have n't come up with one since the hoop and the reason 's plain to see ! you 've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it was n't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here ? !
we have to be realistic , amy . you know things have slowed down a little here at hudsucker --
your i --
know about it ? you think the board would do anything like this without my authorization ? no , this was my idea from the start .
you mean you know about this ?
well yes , we 're pruning away some of the dead wood , but if --
they 're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at hudsucker . why , in new york alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work , people with wives and children and families --
well , i would n't call them nincom --
... you know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing ?
never mind about that ...
oh ! hello , amy -- was it -- i thought she said , mamie --
for pete 's sake , norville !
sure , norville , sure ...
kiss me once , amy ! kiss me once for luck !
oh , norville --
that 's it . a great wheel that gives us each what we deserve ...
yeah , i think i 've heard of that . what goes around comes around .
well , can i at least call you deer ? ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ! seriously , amy , the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma ' -- the great circle of life , death and rebirth .
i wish it were that simple , norville . i wish i was still a gazelle , and you were an antelope or an ibex .
that kind of person would come back as a wildebeest , or a warthog . no , i think it more likely that you were a gazelle , with long , graceful legs , gamboling through the underbrush . perhaps we met once , a chance encounter in a forest glade . i must have been an antelope or an ibex . what times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance , picking the grubs and burrs from one another 's coats . or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways ...
norville , there really is something i have to tell you --
oh no , amy , pardon me for saying so but i find that very farfetched .
oh , i do n't know . maybe i was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
what do you think you were in your previous life , amy ?
what a beautiful thought .
well , the hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants . some will be butterflies . others will be elephants or creatures of the sea .
... the people look like ants .
well -- this year -- if it 's good i plan to make it a tradition . uh , my it certainly is beautiful --
every year ?
yes , you can get carrot juice or italian coffee , and the people there -- well , none of them quite fit in . you 'd love it -- why do n't you come there with me -- they 're having a marathon poetry reading on new year 's eve . i go every year .
you do n't say .
uh -- yes . seventeen . yes , i -- well no , i -- i never really ... there 's a place i go now , the cutest little place near my apartment in greenwich village . it 's called ann 's 440. it 's a beatnik bar .
no ! in vidalia ! farm route 17 !
oh yes ! in muncie !
you know , on farm route 17 .
... huh ?
didja ever go to the top of old man larson 's feed tower and look out over the town ?
... certain people are --
norville , you ca n't trust people here like you did in muncie ...
oh , i do n't blame them , really . i guess i have sort of made a mess of things . these folks have to protect their investment . most of them are very nice people --
i believe in you , norville -- at least i believe in your ... intentions --
i understand that you 're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts . i 'm not that skilled as president . oh sure , i put up a big front -- -- not that everyone 's buying it .
... you do ?
i know that , amy .
norville ... there 's something i have to tell you . you see , i 'm not really a secretary .
oh , it is n't your fault , amy . you 're the one person who 's been standing by me through all this .
... i 'm sorry .
thanks . people seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story .
let me hold it , or you 'll have a real shiner .
sid found me the icepack .
let me look .
oh . nothing , really , just ... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover .
... what happened ?
i bet that 's exactly what she tells herself ! but you and i both know she 's just a dried-up bitter old maid . say , how about you and i grab a little dinner and a show after work ? i was thinking maybe the king and i --
maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance .
exactly . and i bet she 's ugly . real ugly . otherwise , why would n't they print her picture next to her byline ?
smitty .
yeah , you know . probably dresses in men 's clothing , swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole , and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named biff or smoocher or ...
oh , is that it !
yeah , you know . suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays . seems pretty obvious , does n't it ? she 's probably very unattractive and bitter about it .
i 'm quite sure i do n't know what you mean .
yeah , you know , probably one of these fast-talking career gals , thinks she 's one of the boys . probably is one of the boys , if you know what i mean .
confused ?
well , it 's done now -- what 's the use of grousing about it . forget the letter , amy , i just had to blow off some steam ...
sure , but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record !
well , she probably had a deadline ...
well , i do n't know ; maybe she does deserve it . maybe she should 've come in to face you man to man .
aww , naw , amy , that wo n't be necessary . i should n't send it ; she 's just doing her job , i guess .
... why do n't i just type this up ...
... you know ! for kids !
oh sure , you 're biased -- you 're a fellow muncian . but would an imbecile come up with this ?
well , i --
go on , tell the truth ; i trust you and i put a lot of stock in your opinion .
i 'm sure i --
... well , you know me , amy , at least better than that that dame does . do you think i 'm an imbecile ?
is that all , mr. barnes ?
-- these preposterous inventions , would be better suited to the pages of amazing tales magazine . if the editors of the manhattan argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind , perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter ! but i doubt it . i most seriously doubt it . as i doubt also that you could find a home at amazing tales , a periodical which i have enjoyed for many years . yours sincerely , et cetera .
-- or lack thereof ?
the picture was fine ! it 's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath ! of all the irresponsible ... amy , take this down : dear miss archer . i call you 'miss ' because you seem to have 'missed ' the boat completely on this one ! how on earth would you know whether i 'm an imbecile when you do n't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man ! no , change 'guts ' to 'courage . ' no , make it 'common decency . ' these wild speculations about my intelligence --
well , i ... did n't bother to read the article . i did n't think the picture did you justice .
... did you happen to see the front page of today 's manhattan argus ?
please ! norville !
well , i just do n't know how to thank you , mr. barnes --
-- a muncie girl ! can you beat that !
of course -- i went to the muncie , uh , secretarial polytechnic !
oh , of all the foolish ... listen , do you take shorthand ? are you familiar with the mimeograph machine ?
do n't bother to thank me , it 's the easiest thing in the world . matter of fact , i know where a vacancy just came up .
oh , no , really , i --
... a muncie girl ! talk about the cat 's pyjamas ! tell you what , amy . i 'm gon na cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the hud .
why yes , do you know it ?
you 're from muncie ? !
mind if i join you ?
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while i was growing up in a little town you 've probably never heard of --
no thank you . seek and ye shall find , work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education , the ethics of my tender years --
cigarette ?
i myself --
a little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination , a solid work ethic , and an indomitable belief in the future --
at any rate i arrived in town not ten days ago , full of dreams and aspirations , anxious to make my way in the world --
oh , buzz is pretty harmless , really --
what a horrible little person .
i do n't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life ; it 's not a happy story ...
hungry , anyway .
the couch , please .
not at all . you 're light as a feather .
i 'm sorry we had to take the stairs . it was just that horrible little elevator boy ...
well , do a follow-up : hoover : hero or mama 's boy ? the rest of you bums get up off your brains and get me that idea man story !
i filed it yesterday .
yeah , well , monkey or not i 'm still editor of this rag . amy , i thought you were doing that piece on the f.b.i . -- j. edgar hoover : when will he marry ?
... on payday ! the only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you , al .
sez me ! amy archer . why is he an idea man -- because hudsucker says he is ? what 're his ideas ? why wo n't they let anyone interview him ? ...
sez who ?
as a three-dollar bill .
phony , huh ?
i tell ya the guy 's a phony .
amy -- take a break . you 've worked hard on this story -- heck , you broke it for us ! but it 's passed you by and smith here has taken up the slack .
you 're fools , both of you ! it 's obvious they 're out to crucify norville ! they 're trying to destroy him !
whatever ! it 's no dig on you , archer , but this story is hot and you 're no longer on top of it . why , it 's the scoop of the century -- the other papers wo n't have the gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- the allemeinischer zeitung , le figaro , they 'll be choking on our dust come mornin ' --
says who ? !
archer , you 're a broken record . fact is gunderson did design it -- apparently he 's some kind of prodigy --
he grins wolfishly .
you ca n't print that !
it 's about a dimwitted editor who --
watch it , archer --
i 've got an even hotter story -- the sap from the city desk .
whatever . that 's what sells newspapers .
muncie .
i do n't know ...
you do n't know anything ! fact is they have n't bought it ! the stock is cheap , archer ! what 're they waiting for ?
it 's pure speculation ! why , they 'd have my butt in a satchel !
why not , it 's all true ! the board is using this poor guy ! they 're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap !
i ca n't print this !
forty-eight years ...
how long 've you been down here ?
nooo , i do n't guess you will be .
so ya see , i wo n't be in the mailroom long .

i thought you served misfits here !
daddy , it 's like i been tellin ' ya --

nobody wants a hare-brained product like this ! ya see , buzz , it lacks the creative spark , the unalloyed genius that made , uh ...
yeah , but , buddy --
this is the most idiotic thing i 've ever seen in my life !
huh ? ! but , buddy --
... why , this is worthless .
i like to think so ! it 's this little idea i been working on !
oh , uh ... buzz ... is it important ?
roast tom turkey . gee , i 'm hungry too --
my pleasure , sir .
waring hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha-ha ! say , buddy ! when is the sidewalk fully dressed ? when it 's 'wearing ' hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha !
well , i --
say , buddy ! who 's the most liquid businessman on the street ?
waring hudsucker ! na-ha-ha-ha-ha ! say , buddy !
i --
forty-four , the top brass floor say , buddy ! what takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down ?
forty-fourth floor , and it 's very --
... what 's your pleasure , buddy ?
' ... but sid , let me urge you to work closely with the new president , and to keep giving hudsucker industries all your energies -- but not your soul . for while we must strive for success , we must not worship it . long live the hud . waring hudsucker ... '
... yeah , go ahead .
-- tough titty toenails !
' ... and so , sid , the future does not belong to such as i -- nor even you . we have made our compromises with time . the future belongs to the young , who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption . accordingly , in the spirit of hope , and the ringing in of the new , i hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company , and my seat on the board , to whomever is hudsucker 's most recent employee at the time of my demise . i know this will disappoint you -- you , sid , who have served so diligently and for so long . but -- '
'many years , uh ... i know that you will be wondering why i have decided to move on , ending my tenure at hudsucker , and here on earth . you will be thinking , why now , when things are going so well ? granted , from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials , sure , sure , we 're doing fine . however , sid . these things have long since ceased to give me pleasure . i look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company . now i see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success . ' how has this come to pass ? when and why did i trade all of my hopes , dreams and aspirations , for the emptiness of power and wealth ? what the heck have i done ?
yeah , yeah , it 's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph .
'from the desk of waring hudsucker . to . sidney j. mussburger . regarding . my demise . dear sid . by the time you read this , i will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning . i will retain fond memories of the many years you and i -- '
yes sir ...
yeah , go ahead . might learn somethin ' .
sir ?
well , why do n't ya read it .
yessir .
ah , it 's new year 's , i 'm not gon na add to your woes . i 'm just saying .
geez , i --
failure to deliver a blue letter is grounds for dismissal .
oh , geez .
it 's sittin ' in your apron pocket , right where you left it . imbecile .
huh ? oh , geez , mr. hudsucker , i apologize , there was an awful lot of excitement and i guess i must 've mislaid --
anyway . any particular reason you did n't give him my blue letter ? i mean , jesus , norman , just a dying man 's last words and wishes , no big deal .
yes sir ...
mm . well , say what you like about the man 's ethics , he 's a balls-to- the-wall businessman . beat ya any way he can . straight for the jugular . very effective .
norville .
... jesus christopher -- that smarts ... where was i ? oh yeah , the board . i guess sidney 's been puttin ' the screws to ya , huh , norman ?
i do n't care if you 're president of the company ! i need that voucher ! now !
but look , i 'm president of the company now and i --
i need that voucher ! i told you a week ago it was important !
... well , i 'm not sure where i --
barnes ! where the hell have you been ! and where 's my voucher ? !
good afternoon to ya , this is norville barnes --
yeah ?
... this 'll only take a moment .
you have a charming wife , mr. muss -- uh , sid .
well , frankly , i ...
sidney and i are planning a trip to paris and points continental -- are n't we , dear ?
i have n't had --
i 'm brushing up on my french with the most charming man , pierre of fifth avenue . do you know him ?
disappointment ? j'etais destroyee ! i was in bed for a week ! positively sick with fury ! i called in the gardener and said , 'monsieur gonzalez , either those azaleas come up next spring or you are terminee !
that must have been quite a disappointment , mrs. mussburger .
-- so we 'd gone out to the hamptons and the garden was in positive ruins !
ah forget it , kid , ya do n't have to explain to me . he 's a little person . he 's nothing . like i say , ordinarily it would just be a nuisance . but it seems -- well , there was a spy in the company ...
huh ? ! he -- no , i -- he 's just -- maybe i was a little rough on the boy , ya see i --
it 's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you 'd stolen the idea for the , uh , the hoop dingus from him --
how 's that , sid ?
mm . ordinarily i would n't bother you with it , but -- this is embarrassing , kid -- it seems to concern you directly .
ya do n't say .
sure , sure , it 's a tough course . well thanks for coming , kid . i thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we 're having some security problems here at the hud .
sorry i 'm late , sid . that back nine at riverdale is really murder .
well ... i 'm for it ...
... congratulations , kid , you 've really outdone yourself . reinvented the wheel . i 'm going to recommend to the board that we proceed immediately with this , uh ... with the , uh ... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed . of course , as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours .
-- so if you think it 's appropriate , i 'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
finally .
-- but there 's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
damnit , where 's my car !
thank you , sid , but the reason i mention it is , it would require such a small capital investment -- again , you 're the expert here --
i do remember and i was impressed . anyway , that 's all forgotten now . driver !
... you do n't happen to remember the plan i outlined to you the day i set fire to your off -- uh , the day i was promoted ?
okay , sid . like i said , you 're the expert , but --
relax , norville . it 's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover .
lobby . we have n't got all day .
that reminds me , mr. mu ... uh , sid . i never did give you that --
oh my god , sir !
my god ! the bumstead contracts !
sir , my leg is on fire !
up on your feet ! we do n't crawl at hudsucker industries !
but , sir !
not that way ! through the door !
oh my god , sir !
why you nitwit . you almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career !
oh my god , sir !
you nitwit ! i worked for three years on this deal !
oh my god , sir !
my god ! the bumstead contracts ! !
get out of my sight .
but --
get your feet off that desk .
but , sir ! --
you 're fired .
sir ! they voted me most likely to succeed !
not even behind your back ?
no , sir .
... 'shnook ' ? 'dope ' ? 'dipstick ' ? 'lamebrain ' ?
sure , sure . and did your classmates there call you 'jerk ' or ... ... 'schmoe ' ?
at the muncie college of business administration .
hmmm .
well , i made the dean 's list .
all right , but you did n't excel in your studies ... ?
well , i 'm a college graduate --
... education , were you ?
wait a minute !
... you know , for kids ! which is perfect for hudsucker -- not that i claim to be any great genius ; like they say , inspiration is 99 percent perspiration , and in my case i 'd say it 's at least twice that , but i got ta tell ya , mr. mussburger , sir , this sweet baby --
you --
you , maybe you 're the company 's biggest moron . we ca n't use morris , he 's been with us too long , he 's a nice guy , too many friends . matter of fact , why do n't you fire him . no -- scratch that ; i 'll fire him . ... make it fast , make it fast .
i --
tell him i 'll be right there ... well , what is it ?
i --
... who let you in ?
she 's damn good , lou .
she 's good , bennie .
she is !
she is n't !
he do n't look wise .
maybe he 's wise .
no , bennie : lumbago .
... adenoids .
... her mother needs an operation ...
she 's got other problems , of course ...
he notices .
hello , niagara .
old faithful .
yellowstone .
plan two : here come the waterworks .
he do n't look wise .
maybe he 's wise .
... he 's not noticing , benny .
the mark notices .
... no money .
she looks in her purse ...
... and awduhs a light lunch .
she sits down .
she finds him .
she 's looking for her mark .
twenty bucks says not here she do n't find one .
ten bucks says she 's looking for a handout .
there 's one in every story .
... enter the dame .
fah from it ...
ya get the special ?
no kiddin ' , bennie . i got gas .
yeah , tell me about it .
i got gas , bennie .
yes , miss betsy . i mean that . the houngan will speak to the rada drums and the drums will speak to shango and damballa .
are you trying to tell me that the houngan -- the voodoo priest -- could cure mrs. holland ?
no . she was mindless but not like miss jessica . but the houngan cured her .
you mean mama rose was like mrs. holland ?
they even cure nonsense , miss betsy . mama rose was mindless . i was at the houmfort when the houngan brought her mind back .
that 's nonsense , alma .
at the houmfort .
where ?
there are other doctors ... yes , other doctors ... better doctors ...
what do you mean -- `` doctors that are people '' ?
doctors that are people ca n't cure everything .
doctors and nurses can only do so much , alma . they ca n't cure everything .
things so bad , nobody can help -- not even doctor maxwell .
looks like an awful lot of breakfast -- i do n't know whether i 'll be able to get away with it .
a puff-up , i call it . but miss jessica always says `` brioche . ''
what 's this ?
i do my best . every day i dress her just as beautifully as if she was well . it 's just like dressing a great , big doll .
we 'll see if we ca n't make her well , alma , you and i .
she was very sick and then she went mindless , miss .
she must have been beautiful . what happened to her , alma ?
miss jessica used to say this is the only way for a lady to break her fast -- in bed , with a lacy cushion to bank her head up . if you 'd only seen her , miss connell . she looked so pretty .
thank you , alma .
i know , miss . but i like to do it . i like to tend for miss jessica and i want to tend for you . you settle right back , now , and i 'll mix you your coffee .
but i 'm miss jessica 's nurse , alma . you do n't have to do that for me .
i did n't want to frighten you out of your sleep , miss . that 's why i touched you farthest from your heart .
thank you for waking me .
good morning , miss .
if you say , miss . if you say .
but they came to a beautiful place , did n't they ?
if you say , miss . and the enormous boat brought the long-ago fathers and the long-ago mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor .
you mean a figurehead .
no , miss . he 's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat .
alive ?
a man , miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at fort holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful , weeping look on his black face .
ti-misery ? what 's that ?
times gone , fort holland was a fort ... now , no longer . the holland 's are a most old family , miss . they brought the colored people to the island -- the colored folks and ti-misery .
mrs. rand was at the houmfort that night . but there 's nothing wrong with that . she 's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people , to help them .
you must , betsy . they 'll have to believe you .
mrs. rand ...
that 's sweet of you , mrs. rand .
why , betsy -- we ca n't lose you . you mean too much to us here .
perhaps not . but i did come here and i found it was so simple to let the gods speak through me . once started , it seemed such an easy way to do good . i should have known there was no easy way to do good , betsy .
but you did n't have to come up here .
-- and when my husband died i felt helpless . they disobeyed me -- things went from bad to worse . all my husband 's dreams of good health , good sanitation , good morals for these sweet and gentle people seemed to die with him . then , almost accidentally , i discovered the secret of how to deal with them . there was a girl with a baby -- again and again i begged her to boil the drinking water . she never would . then i told her the god , shango , would be pleased and kill the evil spirits in the water if she boiled it . she boiled the water from then on .
i asked you to let me explain . it 's a long story . and not an easy one --
but how did you get here ? what are you doing here ?
i knew you 'd come . and i knew i 'd have to come up here and talk to you . i could n't let you go back without any word . i came to tell you again -- jessica can not be cured .
but , mrs. rand --
wait . do n't draw any conclusions . let me explain .
mrs. rand .
her son drowned . she brooded until her mind was affected . all the houngan did was coax her out of it with a little practical psychology .
i heard the servants talking about someone called mama rose . they said she had been `` mindless '' ...
frankly , my dear , i did n't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl . what are you driving at ?
i do n't mean believe , like believing in a religion . i mean , do you believe it has power ? do you think it could heal a sick person ?
a missionary 's widow ? it is n't very likely , is it ?
you do n't believe in it ?
have n't i ? i suppose i take it for granted . it 's just part of everyday life here .
you 've never said anything about voodoo before , mrs. rand .
some of this native nonsense . the houngan has his prescription and dr. maxwell and i have ours .
try it -- you may have more influence than you think .
i 've no influence with mr. holland .
use your influence with paul . ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table .
i 'd love to .
so -- he says i 'm nice . he 's a nice boy , too , miss connell , a very nice boy . but i 'm worried about his drinking .
thank you , mrs. rand . i think you 're every bit as nice as wes says you are .
nonsense , child ! i know wesley 's been drinking too much lately . i know a great deal more about what goes on at fort holland than you 'd think . i know all about you -- that you 're a nice girl , competent and kind to jessica . the fort needs a girl like you . but now we 've got to get you back there . i 'll walk you back and stay over night . it 'll be a nice change for me .
believe me , mrs. rand , he does n't do this often . this is the first time i 've seen him --
come , come , do n't tell me how sorry you are that i should meet you this way . i 'm even a little glad that wesley 's difficulty brought us together .
oh , mrs. rand --
i really intended going out to the fort and meeting you long before this , miss connell . i 'm mrs. rand -- wesley 's mother .
ti-joseph ?
i 'm afraid so .
i think you need some help .
i would have stayed anyway , dr. maxwell .
miss connell 's testimony will be very important .
it 's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible , mr. holland . the insulin produces a state of coma , a stupor . the patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock . that nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind .
i 've worked with it . i 've seen cures . it is at least a hope .
thank you .
i prepared these for you last night , miss connell .
fortunately , not . this is my first experience with it as a physician . but i have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call zombies . i am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever .
is this disease common in the tropics ?
i 've never heard of a cure .
she can never be cured ?
i do n't know . i prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing , knowing nothing .
does she suffer ?
that 's rather nice , is n't it ?
but it 's so far away ...
a year 's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that 's not so bad , you know .
the west indies ?
no , this is quite final . you see , mr. holland is a sugar planter . he lives in st. sebastian island in the west indies .
that will mean another interview , wo n't it ?
i 'm afraid i 'm not able to tell you much . only that the patient is a young woman -- the wife of a mr. paul holland with whom we do considerable business .
that is good . but i 'd like to know more about the case .
very well . that means that you have met all mr. holland 's requirements . now , as to salary -- it 's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month .
they did n't teach it at memorial hospital . i had my suspicions , though , about the directress of training .
at the memorial hospital -- here in ottawa .
where were you trained ?
yes .
you 're single ?
jessica was never any good for paul . you will be , you are . and mother -- seeing jessica day after day -- never able to escape , never able to forget . please , betsy -- it 's only merciful .
no , wes .
please , wes , do as i ask . you must rest , you must sleep .
you know what she is ! that 's death -- no mind , no senses -- no love , no hate , no feeling -- nothing !
but she 's not dead , wes .
she 's dead . the dead ought to be buried .
not to a nurse . sleep is a cure .
she hated sleep . she used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life , an hour at a time ...
i do n't know . i once asked dr. maxwell the same question . he said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken .
does she suffer ? does she know what she is ?
of course , wes .
betsy , can i talk to you a minute ?
one of these days he 'll start on you , the way he did on her . `` you think life 's beautiful , do n't you , jessica ? you think you 're beautiful , do n't you , jessica ? '' what he could do to that word `` beautiful . '' that 's paul 's great weapon -- words . he uses them the way other men use their fists .
i 'd like to go now , rand . would you mind taking me home ?
that 's right -- he 's playing the noble husband for you , is n't he ? that wo n't last long .
that does n't sound like him .
why ? everybody else knows it . paul saw to that . sometimes i think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm .
i wish i had n't heard --
did you hear what he sang ?
do n't let it bother you so , wes .
wait . i want to listen .
listen , did i tell you that story about the little mule at the plantation -- the little mule and clement ? let me tell you . it 's one of the funniest stories --
i 'm a nurse . i always watch people when they pour something . i watched ti-joseph and it was exactly two ounces .
how do you know there 's two ounces in a drink ?
higher mathematics . two ounces to a drink -- three drinks , six ounces .
what in the world are you talking about ? six ounces -- ?
it must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum .
bring me another , ti-joseph . i have to keep the lady entertained .
by a curious coincidence , it 's my day off , too .
but do n't you have to work ?
well -- and things -- might be a better description of what you 'll find . i 'd better come along and show you the town .
i was just beginning to wonder . are n't there shops , restaurants and things ?
but what in the world can you do with a day off in st. sebastian ?
it 's my day off .
where do you think you 're going ?
it 'll wait .
perhaps you ought to get on to the mill .
ah , yes , our paul , strong and silent and very sad -- quite the byronic character . perhaps i ought to cultivate it .
i do n't know . he spoke to me last night on the boat . i liked him very much .
yes , the redoubtable paul . he has the plantation , and i , as you must have noticed , have all the charm .
mr. holland ?
do n't worry . i was n't missed . the only important man here is the owner .
of course . it 's been nice of you to spend this much time with me .
as a matter of fact , it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off . you 'll have to excuse me .
we 're half-brothers . paul is mother 's first child . when his father died , she married my father . dr. rand , the missionary . and you know what they say about missionaries ' children .
i wondered about your different accents . i 'm still wondering about your names -- rand and holland .
i went to school in buffalo . paul went to school in england .
-- but , you 're an american ?
my brother 's wife .
thank you . but who sits there ?
and that -- is my chair . and this -- is miss connell -- who is beautiful .
i like her already .
no -- she just runs the place . she 's everything else -- amazing woman , mother . you 'll like her .
is she a doctor ?
and that chair -- is the particular property of mrs. rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us . too wise , in fact , to live under the same roof . she prefers the village dispensary .
yes -- on the boat .
it seems we are having dinner by ourselves , miss connell . but i may as well introduce everyone to you , anyway . there -- in the master 's chair , sits the master -- my half-brother paul holland . but you 've already met him .
i guess i 'll wait until i 'm home , mrs. rand .
considering that the paper is three months old and this is n't sunday -- no thank you .
yes .
you want that ?
i want you to be safe , betsy . i want to know you 're away from this place -- home again , where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one .
that 's past -- that 's over and done with ...
i remember words i said to jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her , to madden her .
do n't , paul -- do n't doubt yourself -- do n't make me doubt you .
the night you came to me in this room -- to comfort me , to help me -- i turned you away .
you wanted to warn me ...
no . it 's not just how i felt toward jessica . i 've been cruel to even you .
i can understand that . everyone feels that way about someone .
how do you know i 'm not ? i was cruel to jessica . when i got to know her -- when i found out how empty and ungenerous she was , there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her .
you ca n't believe that . you do n't know what viciousness it would take to drive a person mad . you 're not vicious or cruel , paul .
i have no defense . so far as i know -- it is true .
i still ca n't believe it paul -- that you would n't say a word in your own defense .
i hated her .
she was beautiful .
you think i love jessica and want her back . it is like you to think that -- clean , decent thinking .
what i saw the other night , i did n't dare believe , betsy --
you know why . you saw it the other night at the piano . you turned away from me .
because you wanted to give my wife back to me ? why should that mean anything to you ?
i told you .
you have deliberately endangered mrs. holland 's life . there 's no telling what you may have started with this insanity . why did you do it ?
i took mrs. holland to the houmfort . i thought they might cure her .
help me ? how ?
i wanted to help you .
instead -- you come , with sympathy , betsy , and a generous heart . do n't forget that . do n't call it nothing .
and instead , i came -- bringing you nothing .
i 've been waiting here for hours , trying to imagine jessica well again -- wondering what i 'd feel . i could see jessica as she used to be , i could hear her say in that sweet mocking voice , `` paul , darling ... '' the whole thing beginning all over again ...
i imagined this so differently ...
do n't take it to heart , betsy .
she is alive , mr. holland -- that 's all .
well ?
did n't i ? i do n't know . that 's the simple truth of it . i do n't know .
you did n't drive her mad .
what you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other 's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband ? do you love that ?
i love fort holland .
you have helped me . i want you to know i 'm sorry i brought you here . when i thought of a nurse , i thought of someone hard and impersonal .
i do n't know . i wanted to help you . and now that i 'm here , i do n't know how .
why did you come in here ?
i know what you went through tonight . i kept thinking of what you said : that all good things died here , violently .
i often do .
i heard you playing .
i 'm afraid it 's not very frightening . they have their songs and dances and carry on and finally , as i understand it , one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people .
you do n't seem very disturbed by it . i 've always thought voodoo was something to be scared of : the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened .
i 'm afraid the decanter will have to stay where it is . i engaged you , miss connell , to take care of my wife , not my brother .
still , i feel you should remove the decanter . wes is not an alcoholic yet , mr. holland . but as a nurse i can tell you that it wo n't be long before he is .
i 've no sympathy with people who ca n't resist temptation .
but for wes -- it must be a temptation to him .
it 's always stood there , miss connell . i can remember it in my grandfather 's time and my father 's . i 'm afraid it will have to remain .
yes , he can . but i 've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
wesley can be very entertaining .
well , i had a good time up to a point .
i heard about your little misadventure yesterday , miss connell . on your first `` day off , '' too .
good morning .
good morning , miss connell .
do n't . it will save you a great deal of trouble and other people a great unhappiness .
i 've never given it much thought .
and charming ?
i suppose so . yes .
many people thought her beautiful .
mrs. holland must have been beautiful -- -
you did n't find your patient so frightening in the daylight , did you ?
why should you be ? my wife is a mental case . please keep that in mind , miss connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about zombies .
i 'm sorry ...
a mental case ?
of course not !
surely nurses are n't afraid of the dark ?
nothing -- really . but you must admit it 's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
and what is so alarming about the tower , miss connell ?
if i were as timid as you seem to think , mr. holland , i would n't have gone into the tower in the first place .
that 's hard to believe , after what happened last night .
i am not a frightened girl .
i made it clear in my letter to the company . this is not a position for a frightened girl .
yes . but it was once the figurehead of a slave ship . that 's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery . for generations they found life a burden . that 's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial .
a figure of st. sebastian .
i 'm not sure i can make you understand . you know what this is ?
why was the maid crying ?
a woman crying ? no one 's been crying here .
i heard someone crying -- a woman --
no , thank you . tomorrow 's time enough for you to begin work .
ca n't i take it for you ?
yes , thank you .
have the servants made you comfortable ?
you ca n't really believe that .
it 's easy enough to read the thoughts of a newcomer . everything seems beautiful because you do n't understand . those flying fish -- they are not leaping for joy . they 're jumping in terror . bigger fish want to eat them . that luminous water -- it takes its gleam from millions of tiny dead bodies . it 's the glitter of putrescence . there 's no beauty here -- it 's death and decay .
you read my thoughts , mr. holland .
it is not beautiful .
you were possessed . that is true -- possessed by your subconscious mind . you were in the houmfort , surrounded by their symbols . to them , nothing worse can happen to a person than to be made into a zombie . your subconscious mind used their own words for evil .
but i had no thought of harming her . it was n't i ...
two things had happened , mrs. rand . one was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever . the other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill , because she had hurt your sons .
yes , i said it , and i made myself believe it . but when i got here , jessica was already raging with fever .
ah -- that 's where reason took hold .
i hated myself . i kept saying to myself over and over again that these people had no power ; they had no strange drugs ; that there is no such thing as a zombie .
and what happened then , mrs. rand ?
it 's more than that , doctor . i 've entered into their ceremonies - pretended to be possessed by their gods ...
i think i do . i 've often talked a little voodoo to get medicine down a patient 's throat .
i am afraid , wesley , he has that right . and i will have to urge him to use it .
wesley !
i 'm quite sure nothing will happen , doctor .
this is something else . they 're curious . curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture .
i would n't worry too much , commissioner . it 'll pass . we 've had this sort of thing before .
emotion tricks all of us , mrs. rand . and you are a woman with a very strong conscience . that conscience has been tormenting you . the rest is coincidence . there is no such thing as a zombie . the dead do not come back to life . death is final .
dr. maxwell is right , mother .
maybe it 's better this way , mother . i 'm glad you 're going home , betsy -- you 'll be out of the mess .
i did everything i could to forestall this , paul . i do n't think there 's any question of your innocence in the matter . but there 's been too much talk . the thing 's out of hand .
in other words , i 'm on trial .
of the nature of mrs. holland 's illness . and , of course , the events which led up to it .
investigation of what ?
in view of all the circumstances , the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation .
what about her ?
no -- it 's about mrs. holland . a result of our discussion the other day , i 'm afraid .
an accident at the mill ?
paul , we 're not trying to blame miss connell . it is n't a question of blame . it 's a question of what we are to do with jessica . the commissioner is very concerned .
but i assure you , father walters , miss connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there .
technical responsibility , real responsibility -- what difference does it make ? jessica lives -- or she dies . that 's what we 're talking about !
it is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility ...
i do n't know -- i do n't know --
you admit that it is terribly dangerous . why do you advise it ?
insulin shock treatment is an extreme measure , mr. holland . but -- as miss connell pointed out when she suggested it -- this is an extreme case .
all that you say comes down to the same thing . you are asking me to pass a sentence of life or death on my own wife .
foolish ? tell them how foolish it is , paul -- tell them !
that could be a serious accusation , rand , if it were n't a foolish one .
because he drove jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly !
why ?
i tell you he has n't and he would n't dare use it if he had .
it does n't matter what you call it . i can tell you right now jessica is n't going !
i believe there 's a kinder name for it , wesley . at st. thomas , it 's called the institute for mental therapy .
to the asylum ?
if i were as sure as you , mrs. rand , we would n't be here . i 'll tell you quite bluntly : for the peace of the island and possibly for her own safety , we 've come to ask you to send mrs. holland away to st. thomas .
no . you 're quite wrong . right here 's the seat of the trouble . mrs. holland has become an object of speculation and religious interest to these people . it 's revived all their old superstitions -- zombies -- and that sort of nonsense .
well , jeffries , why come to us about it ? why do n't you go up to the houmfort and put a stop to the drumming and dancing -- that 's what causes all the trouble .
that night , i went to the houmfort . i kept seeing jessica 's face -- smiling -- smiling because two men hated each other -- because she was beautiful enough to take my family in her hands and break it apart . the drums seemed to be beating in my head . the chanting -- the lights -- everything blurred together . and then i heard a voice , speaking in a sudden silence . my voice . i was possessed . i said that the woman at fort holland was evil and that the houngan must maker her a zombie .
that is n't true . you never understood her .
betsy , tell them about the houmfort . tell them what you saw there .
are you going to lie for him , mother ?
you 're wrong , wesley . the guilt is mine -- all of it .
we 're all in it . there wo n't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use . say something , paul ! you 've always been good with words . put some together , now , and tell us that you 're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it does n't rest squarely on your shoulders !
dr. maxwell has very unpleasant news for us .
dr. maxwell -- it 's nice to see you .
in rhode island with the folks . i 'm a free agent tonight .
yeah , see you bright and early monday am . say , where 's the wife ?
well , gon na make a break for the hors d'oeuvres guy .
yeah , good .
do n't see how . i think the public 's had its fill of this gangster stuff . no , trust me -- disaster pics . and air hockey .
darned right . look here , benj , whaddya make of this sequel to the godfather ? you think it 's gon na work ?
well , hey , is n't that a one-in-a million coincidence . a real dreamer , jim williams , eh ?
well , it 's the funniest thing . i 've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture , you understand , between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new styrofoam packaging . little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping . miraculous . anyway , it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor , jim williams . how about that !
clair , george clair ! what the hell brings you to new canaan ?
benjie !
up the organization ! bastard .
right o ' .
got a meeting uptown .
brilliant . hey , you heading out a little early today ?
overpriced bomb , cost over $ 6 million -- no stars , and no one 's into the horror genre these days anyway . i 'm advising the company recommend reducing positions there . it 's disaster films that are gon na stay at the top .
ben you know that 's your territory - and i would n't dream to trespass - you 're the expert . hey , how do you think paramount 's gon na do with that blatty novel , what 's it called ? the exorcist ?
gotcha george , not a problem . tomorrow . hey , you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself ?
and speaking of which , you have those market share charts mr. shackley was asking about ?
paul ? yeah . you think --
oh you know , for a minute i thought it was --
ben , i do n't think he wants us here .
yeah . well , we can just --
the phone 's out .
do you think ? maybe we should call someone --
we 'll talk in the morning .
sure . i 'll try . and we 'll talk in the morning ?
you 'll get some sleep on the couch out there ?
ben .
i 'll drive you --
ben , i 've got a ride home . maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here ?
elena .
we 're not going anywhere .
ready to go ?
thanks for the diagnosis , ben . thank you . so let 's just go to this fiasco if that 's what you want to do . let 's just go on in . i 'd rather talk to anyone else but you .
elena , you 're just getting wound up to get wound up .
well , i 'm really pleased to hear a confession .
elena , it 's not what you think . it 's not a big plot . honestly . honestly . i do n't know if you want to go over this now , but it 's just something that comes over me . i do n't feel good about it . i know i 've done what i did n't want to do . i do n't know --
elena .
you have some marker , that 's what i think , if you want to know the truth . you have some marker and you 're going to put it on the house keys so that janey can find them and then when i get back to the house i 'll find the two of you in there and wendy 'll be able to hear you and paul will be back and he 'll hear you and i 'll catch you , that 's what i think . she 'll be swearing and banging against the wall and i 'll catch --
i 'm not .
you 're not going to --
i 'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else 's wife . that 's not why we 're here , right ? we 're simply being neighbors here , and i think we should do just that --
damn it , ben --
i think we 're here and we do n't have to stay -- we ought simply to put in an appearance and then we can head home .
well ?
yeah , well , if we 'd understood we could have invented some kind of excuse . a key party -- did you see how stuffed that bowl was already ?
that this was going to be a key party ?
i know , i know . i had no idea --
this just is n't the best moment for this .
oh , yeah . yeah , we 'll be right back , dot .
in the car .
you 've ...
benjamin . that 's supposed to explain it ?
sure i do . do i know what loneliness feels like ? sure i do . i know a lot about it , if that 's what you mean .
oh lord . you think i 'm so dense . and now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party . you want to wear that ridiculous shirt which does n't go with those pants at all . you want to wear that , and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you 're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this ... you do n't really know what this feels like .
what else could i be ? what else could i be ? we 're not living in the real world here . you 're living out some fantasy land from the past , or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts ... there are some hard facts here .
if you 're going to insult me --
well , what kind of faithfulness are you after ?
it 's a starting place .
am i unfaithful ? is that what you 're trying to say ?
your unfaithfulness -- that 's what i 'm trying to talk about . your unfaithfulness . your betrayal . your dalliance . and you wo n't do me the dignity of being up front about it .
listen , elena , if you 're gon na pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
i 'm not surprised .
elena , what are you 're talking about ?
do n't be dim .
what do you mean ?
it would n't make a pleasant evening , if that 's what you 're after . i do n't want to talk about it . stupid mustache cup .
what 's on your mind ? do n't --
i have no idea .
you think i --
do n't start .
no advice from the experts , huh ?
see for yourself .
what 's for dessert ?
that one .
yeah , that one .
oh right . the mustache coffee cup . the one that was sitting on the dash .
oh , just dropping off a coffee cup . jim left it , last time he was over . it was on the dash of the car . you were , you know , reading , thought i 'd just catch some air . let 's eat .
so what were you doing in the williams ' basement anyway ?
i get you loud and clear ... hey , you look nice .
up to you . i 'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that .
in the basement over at janey and jim 's . with that weirdo mikey . not even a tv on . and they 're on the floor and he 's got his trousers down though thank goodness she 's still dressed . well , i really let him have it ! ... and wendy came home peacefully ... hey , should i dress for the halford 's now , or - give me your -
you go dry off now .
dinner in ten minutes .
stuffed and baking .
the turkey in ?
leave it -- i 'll wash it for you .
what ?
that shirt ?
yikes -- i was hoping to wear this thing to the halford 's friday .
hell , i know . i -- i guess if you want to accuse me , you 've got -- oh hell ! i 've got to pick up paul . i almost forgot .
i was n't accusing you , ben . it 's just that we 've got to be honest . not just with ourselves , but with the children .
you have to bring this up now ? what ? did i do something here ? is that it ? is it something i did ?
no , i did n't mean to sound negative . it was -- but ben . what is going to happen with us ? have you --
whatever that means elena -- and you complain about me not communicating ... i thought it was --
i 'm just sad ben -- i mean it was ... you were , but , you know . i just do n't know ...
you crying ?
ben , maybe no talking right now ? if you start talking , you 're going to --
you know elena , i 've been thinking --
i ... i think i am ...
i do . i 'm -- are you ... ?
because you like it on your turkey sandwiches .
um , yes .
oh . sure , i -- did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce ?
you all right there ?
hmm . good night .
oh yeah . musk , or something . you like it ?
rough day . good night .
so early ?
i 'm , uh , going to bed .
well , it is a neighborhood tradition .
what do you think ?
you want to go ?
the halfords have invited us again this year .
good night .
good night .
elena .
-- and you have n't moved out yet . it 's because you 're too lazy , ben . too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
yeah but elena , even you do n't believe all that `` i 'm ok. you 're ok '' stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself . i 've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject , and --
it 's you ben who needs to talk . i 've had my say , and i 'm waiting to hear back from you .
oh not again elena ! if we 've got problems , why ca n't you just come out and talk about them .
so maybe you 'll come too ?
then again , why should she be ? i mean with us , with our ...
why should n't she be ?
i did , but -- somebody should probably see her , talk to her ... you think she 's ok ?
that shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see ? i thought you dropped him .
i 've been thinking , ben , about wendy . i was going to ask if she 'd come with me sometime to meet dr. woolens .
i was n't star --
you 're staring at me .
and as usual no one believed me ...
do n't be so modest , ben . it 's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends . you were the first to predict that billy jack would be a hit --
gotcha .
no thank you . we should be off .
ok , ok , the defense rests . want another ?
libbets ? what kind of name is libbets ?
libbets . libbets casey .
ah let the guy have his fun . what 's the name of this girl with the park avenue address ?
stay out of trouble .
see you .
thanks .
sure dad .
um , paul . on second thought , can you do me a favor and pretend i never said any of that .
all the more reason for this little heart to heart ... great .
uh , dad , you know i 'm 16 .
holy ! well . if you 're worried about anything , just feel free to ask , and , uh , we can look it up .
well , the whole gamut . facts of life and all . some fatherly advice , because , i tell you , there 's things happening that you 're probably old enough ... well ... for example , on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it 's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and , um , not onto the linen , and not on your sister 's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
about ?
you know paul , i 've been thinking , maybe this is as good a time as any to have a little talk , you know , about -- well --
yeah .
well it 's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all , but this st. peter 's , it 's top of the line , eh ?
hnnn .
anyone special ? you know ...
fine .
grades ?
good .
classes ?
all right .
so how 's school treating you ?
lab experiments ? right smart guy -- paul , you know your mother 's gon na be disappointed not to see more of you -- in fact , let me make this more than a simple request guy , i think you should ...
well dad , actually i thought i 'd take the morning train on thanksgiving -- got a lot of studying , papers , you know , lab experiments --
well good . just confirming . you 'll be on the 3:50 wednesday afternoon .
i 'm fine dad .
hey guy . things ok up there ? you all right ?
hi dad .
i just ca n't believe you could be so --
how you take it is n't all that interesting to me , benjamin . i 'm sorry --
jimmy ? jimmy ? i do n't know how to take this . and what do you mean , jimmy ? i thought you said you and your husband --
listen , benjamin hood . i have obligations that precede your ... from before you showed up . one or two , you know , good-natured encounters , that does n't mean i 'm ... i 'm not just some toy for you . when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party , i just did them , that 's all , because i wanted to do them before i saw jimmy .
what ?
a prior engagement overcame me .
do n't bullshit me around , janey . jesus christ , i waited around for more than half an hour , in nothing but my boxer shorts , and -- and what 's all that about ? what the hell happened ?
what are you talking about ?
damn right , but where the hell were you ?
oh jeez , benjie . well , here you are .
right . gotcha .
birth control .
huh ?
yeah , but , i -- i 've been working a lot lately , and -- no , that 's not it . i guess we 've just been on the verge of saying something , whatever it is , just saying something to each other . on the verge .
have i noticed anything ? i 'm not married to her benjamin , you are . i think you 've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her .
maybe it 's all for the better , you know ? yesterday , at dinner , well , she has n't said anything ... has she acted funny to you , i mean , have you noticed anything ?
in a bit .
after the thanksgiving i had , i need it . you having one ?
here .
gotcha .
you should probably get dressed . the boys will be home soon .
you have a point there . that 's a very good point . we 're having an affair . right . an explicitly sexual relationship . your needs . my needs . you 're absolutely right .
you 're boring me . i have a husband . i do n't particularly feel the need for another .
yeah ?
ben --
it 's like farming . i am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks , and george clair has obviously , in the mere two years since he joined the firm , he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro , and i assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course . and the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
c'mon .
he 's probably been waiting all night at the station .
yeah .
your toes cold ?
i mean , he 's not serious , he 'll end up living off janey and jim , you watch . it 's just that you develop a sense when you get older , if things are going to work out or if they wo n't , and sometimes it 's not worth the mess ...
huh ?
look , kiddo , do n't worry about it . i really do n't care that much . i 'm just not sure he 's good enough , that 's all .
i 'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now , lady . let 's go . right now . you and i can discuss it on the walk home .
well , then forget all this stern dad stuff .
who else would i be talking to ? and take that thing off !
talking to me , dad ?
what do i think ? i think you 're probably touching each other . i think you 're touching that reckless jerk-off , for god 's sake , and i think he 's trying to get into your slacks . i think , at fourteen years of age , that you 're getting ready to give up your girlhood --
what do you think we 're doing , dad ?
what the hell are you kids doing down here ?
jesus all right enough !
... while children in africa and asia are napalmed and --
nothing .
what you been up to ?
nah .
i 'm picking up paul at the station - want to come ?
good night kiddo .
good-night dad .
if i were a fascist i would have sent you to one of those southern military academies a long time ago . now get to bed .
fascist !
get to sleep young lady -- and i mean it .
dad stop it !
i thought i 'd start trying . if you do n't mind . but i am going to florida and i do have a new nurse .
that was a joke ? you do n't tell jokes .
jesus , benjamin , you 're still as gullible as ever .
what ?
ben , i 'm going to florida . i hate thanksgiving and i hate the cold . i have a new nurse . she 's a negro , she weighs three hundred pounds , and i 've decided to leave my entire estate to her .
oh . elena wanted to know when we could expect you on thanksgiving . it 's just going to be you this year .
it was all junk !
alright dad . but you sold the house , you did n't tell anyone , including the irs , and i 'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
it 's not the taxes i object to . it 's all the fines and penalties .
but i -- well maybe i love her . elena .
but what ?
but ...
-- 73 , and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket , and for crying out loud , ben , be a man and just get it over with . i would have if i 'd had the chance .
-- 73
that 's besides the point . the point is if i 'd had any sense in me i 'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago , and that 's the truth , and here it is , 1972 --
-- what advice ? you never --
-- waiter ! where 's my cobb salad ? you want advice ben ? if your big brother were still alive i 'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head . look kid , you married that woman against my advice --
but dad , you guys truly hated each other , i mean really hated each --
-- your mother , god bless her , stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - i assume you 're talking here about divorce ? the very thought --
well , elena and i have kind of been talking , not really talking , but --
oh for crying out loud ben , you do n't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
actually it 's not about work , it 's advice about --
you know , dah --
advice ? i 'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you , ben . unless - have you quit your job ? they fired you ?
i was actually trying to see about getting a little advice , you know --
that 's besides the point .
-- well what am i supposed to call you ?
and why are you still calling me dad ? you 're forty years old already , and --
we do n't have to always go to your club , dad .
darn it , dave .
do n't fret , benjie , it 's --
it 's what ?
sure is good shit . it 's opiated . i had it in my chamber for a while . i was smoking this other --
good shit .
thanks for the advice dave .
welcome to the monkey house has been a seminal influence on me -- hey benjamin -- give it a try ? this stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions .
and reverend edwards ? did you make the list ?
i suppose we 'll make an appearance .
hello you two . am i barging in on some kind of religious study group ? elena , you look marvelous . will i see you and ben at the halford 's ?
it was lovely !
thank you janey .
you know , it 's a california thing . that scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in l.a. you know , the men put their car keys in a bowl , and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever 's keys they 've got . anyhow that 's how she met this rod person or whatever his name is and he 's left his wife and she 's packing for california . irwin is devastated . it 's so ironic .
a key party ?
and to think -- they met at a key party of all things .
phone 's out . i hope the pipe 's --
sure . maybe coffee .
you want to come in , get a cup of coffee -- warm up ? i can either walk you home , or you could crash in the guest room .
yes . well , i guess we can walk from here .
yeah . you ?
you okay ?
of course .
maybe you just need -- look , can you wait here a sec , i need to tidy up -- just a minute , i 'll be right back . you 'll wait ?
that 's fine . i would n't expect you to see it any other way .
well , we can talk about it .
jesus , let me make it up to you -- i can do better than that , honestly --
jim , maybe we should just go . i 've got to look in on the kids . paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city .
things are really rotten at home . you would n't believe how rotten . janey 's sick . she 's unstable , i guess ... it 's not the right time to tell you ... but that 's it -- it 's like i ca n't make her happy , the boys ca n't make her happy , she just does n't --
nah , that was n't in the contract .
okay . shall we clean up around here first ? do you think it 's all right --
what the hey . let 's go for a drive .
now do n't make me feel as if i 'm being too forward , ok ? if you do n't --
my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom , or at least he wishes he were . i 've been married to him for 17 years and i do n't have any intention of going in there to get him ... so what i 'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy , and since you are standing here alone , i 'm proposing that you and i do what makes sense . stay warm . pass some time . that 's all .
look , elena , the fact that we 're neighbors ... you know , close friends , well it sort of makes this a little strange , do n't you think ?
well , maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
you want coffee or something ?
somehow it was different in my imagination when i thought about it . actually , i did n't think about it at all , really .
you could n't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk .
thanks , but -- oh , i do n't think so . it 's been kind of a discouraging evening .
let me .
well , i have to say i do n't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl . does n't seem entirely safe , leaving your car keys around ?
it 'll warm you up .
i do n't like coffee .
just bundle up . it 's supposed to freeze tonight . we 'll see you in the morning .
oh i thought i 'd steal the station wagon , drive up to a commune . or set the house on fire . you know .
what sort of problems are you planning exactly ?
just curious . if there 's a problem , i guess i 'll just call you there to interrupt .
i suppose . why ?
is it a big party ? a big neighborhood party ?
we 're going to the halford 's . the number 's on the calendar in the kitchen . we should be home around 11 .
well , i 'm sure your father and i would love to hear what you 're playing these days . maybe after dinner .
i do n't really need to practice . i just play a few notes , you know , so i thought maybe i 'd stay in .
i thought you quit the band - i never hear you practice anymore .
they need the money for my band uniform at school .
oh wendy .
well , i saw what i saw , and if you do n't want to believe me --
we 've been through this wendy james taylor was actually at that clinic up near boston .
i know . they 're rich drug addicts and celebrities . when i saw james taylor there , and --
the people at silver meadows are n't psychos .
you 're not a psycho !
wendy , of course . i 'm sorry . you must think i 'm ripe to be checked into silver meadows .
mom . are you ok ?
weightless almost -- as if i were seeing my own memories of being a girl . there was something internal about it .
we were just riding around .
mikey williams ?
nobody .
who ?
with mikey ?
i saw you on your bike today .
hi wendy .
hi mom .
none at all . i 'll leave it in front of your garage . happy thanksgiving .
thanks for the lift . if the bike 's any bother --
here you are .
you do n't have to apologize . i 'm too much of a cynic . you actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- do n't mind me .
i 'm that predictable ? no , you do n't have to answer that . it 's just that with the kids almost grown --
educated guess .
how 'd you know ?
social work ?
i 'm thinking of going back to school .
it 's not like we 're too busy .
i used to know how to cook .
thanks for eating it . i do n't know why i even pretend i can cook .
thanks again . for the dinner .
of course .
it 's really quite all right .
oh .
i insist . do n't touch them .
it 's not a bother .
please do n't .
i 'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile .
sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep .
you 're here ... i 'm a bit surprised .
perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me philip ?
reverend edwards .
that i will indeed .
i 'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about . take care .
i 'm afraid she 's something of a gossip , is n't she ?
ouch .
and you 're still trying to get me into bed .
now you are being rude .
but not too ashamed .
you were n't . you actually , for some reason , you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself .
i 'm sorry . that was stupid of me . i did n't mean to be so rude .
if that 's a potential you see yourself fulfilling ... i mean ... my , i sound a bit --
i would say it sounds like you 're trying to get me into bed .
self-realization . ministering to help people reach their fullest potential . would you believe me if i told you i want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization ?
that 's right .
you ask what the point is ?
all well and good -- but tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in ?
-- and god the angry parent , and the spirit the hope of an integrated adult self .
you 're saying that christ is the child , and --
in many ways , the church-bound tradition of the father , son , and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all . it 's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology .
forget how to ride a bike .
forget what ?
they say you never forget .
my daughter . i have n't been on a bike for years . when was the last time you rode a bike ?
well i of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it 's the disorganization that 's liberating -- and of course i 've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments , in small groups , and one on one , couples --
i suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- i 've never been much of a joiner , although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
it 's been a tremendously transformative year -- maybe a little controversial of course , but we 're breaking down the old unitarian barriers --
no need to make excuses --

my man , i speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid . i 've been giving this one a lot of thought , and i believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
shit . you 're not planning --
am i right or am i right ?
what do you mean ?
aha ! i could sense the vibe .
what ?
um , libbets casey .
sleep all day . i mean , look , it 's already getting dark outside , and you 're just getting up .
do what ?
how can you do that man ?
and remember , with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb , do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you 're stoned .
flame on , asshole .
paul , let me enlighten you about something . you and i exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide , that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other . i 'm off to get laid . see you .
where you going ?
see ya .
no more man . i 'm about to drop as it is .
i got ta get to english class .
paul , cancel your mental appointments , baby . what are you , like still stoned from last night ?
man , francis , you are one drug addled elitist freak , and when the revolution comes i do not want to be lined up with you and shot , 'cause you 're fucking ripe for political reeducation , you know , like in the fields .
waste not master hood -- that was $ 20 for the bag .
the water , as you call it , is a special mixture of amaretto and ben & ben blended for just the exact chemical interaction with the last of our precious thai stick .
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night .
arise and shine , young hood .
let 's see !
come on paulie , share the wealth . you copped 'em from her mom 's stash anyway .
groovy . young master of the revels , a treat for our hostess ?
no candy for me ?
yeah , paul , are you gon na get home okay ?
everything 's gon na freeze , the big freeze .
howdy there . you , young knight . can you check on the mead ? can you sally forth and secure us some more mead ?
major .
awesome sleet and rain .
hell , i guess he takes after me , huh ?
tonight ? jim , he 's been out of it since he was born .
you notice anything with mikey lately ? the kid seemed a little out of it tonight , eh ?
just be careful .
sorry honey . hell , we 've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed .
jesus , jim !
play with the whip .
no !
it 's not packed with explosives , is it ?
you know , it 's the whip -- the one uncle frank got me from mexico .
would it matter ? and what 's that ?
you going to tell dad ?
hey . i 'll take this stuff .
hah hah you 're funny . a bath . like a brother and sister . oh man , i 'm so wasted .
right . cool . so , how about we take a bath together ?
i do .
and i have a feeling for you too , because you 're just like -- i feel for you like you 're -- you 're just like --
you do ? i 'm glad . because i feel for you --
and i have a special feeling too , because i do . it 's special .
it 's like very positive , and i feel a real special feeling , because you really --
my what ?
sure i do , you know , like your aura . that you give off .
yeah but you do n't even know me really .
you know libbets , i really feel , you know , like a real connection to you --
yeah .
thanks for the advice dad .
maybe you should have just a half .
what is it ?
well , uh , i do n't , it 's really --
hey , it 's a sellable skill .
frankie opens them with his teeth .
the idiot .
great , thanks for the tip .
if you liked notes from underground , you 'll love the idiot .
the idiot ?
um , libbets . hey , dostoyevsky , i 'm also really a fan , and what you were saying , you know , have you ever read the idiot ?
good thinking marge .
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in , why do n't you just keep your libbets thing a secret from him ?
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here ?
they did it last year too . it 's like traditional or something . they 've got this humongoid park ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash . are n't the hugely wealthy sad ?
how do you know this shit ?
my diagnosis is messed in the head . a poor little rich girl -- i mean check out the jeans and fur look . and lend your ears to this brutality . like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to switzerland to ski over thanksgiving break -- and like they did n't invite her !
truly ? do speak .
that 's good , because i do n't think libbets is capable of the sex act .
it 's beyond mere physical attraction .
yeah , well , you 've been in love with like every other girl here , i was wondering when you 'd get around to libbets .
i 'm in love with libbets casey .
yeah . when it freezes , i guess that means the molecules are not moving . so when you breathe , there 's nothing in the air , you know , to breathe in to your body . the molecules have stopped . so it 's clean .
it 's freezing .
out .
where you going ?
i 'm not good at math . just geometry .
why are you so good at math but not in english ?
sure , anything but this english .
geometry ?
yeah ?
mikey ?
i do n't have a girlfriend .
no one .
who said so ?
stupid ! is wendy hood your girlfriend ?
yeah .
i 'm sorry if i got you into trouble . maybe we do n't have to , you know ... unless you really want to .
maybe . ca n't really tell yet .
you get in trouble ?
yeah . yours ?
you 're parents at that party ?
4:30 movie . when worlds collide .
huh ?
when worlds collide .
wendy !
wow !

i do n't know .
maybe we can mess around . you know , only if you want to ...
there 's a tv in the basement .
maybe we can just watch some tv .
see , no one 's here . maybe you want to go to the basement ?
i dunno . i --
you have to follow me ?
then why 'd you come after me ?
i do n't ever want to see you .

i 'm chewing .

i have plans .
what are you doing at home on a friday night ?
right .
shit . i ca n't really talk about it . i guess i better get to the train .

what time is it ?
is this charles ?
charles , what time is it ?
hood residence .
libbets ? what kind of a name is libbets ?

calling an individual , charles , in new york . confirming a social outing for friday night .
why do n't you use the phone downstairs ?
may i operate your telephonic apparatus ?
yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth .
i do n't know . dad seems a little weird .
dad 's like doing his up with people routine , mom has n't been saying much .
how are the parental units functioning these days ?
greetings , charles .
hello , charles .
nixon , doofus ! it 's incredible . he should be shot .
watching what ?
i have not touched your sh -- stuff . you watching this ?
charles . have you been keeping out of my shit ? have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room ?
charles .
i do n't know either . you spin around , when you lie down .
i do n't know . how do i know ?
that 's nice . are you drunk ?
i love you .
that 's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff , like after a sexy dream .
huh ?
have you ever had a nocturnal emission ?
okay .
one more shot ?
it feels warm .
you never tasted the stuff ?
vodka ?
want a drink ?
do n't worry about them . they 're at that party , getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about mcgovern and stuff .
we -- we have to go to the guest room . we ca n't stay in here . what if mikey ? my parents ?
they left it in the jungle .
communist viet cong .
well . it looks like someone got to his private parts before us .
he would n't blow up . he 'd just get all mangled or twisted .
if it was n't raining we could take him outside and blow him up .
he 's dead .
no .
are you his girlfriend ?
yeah .
mike 's out -- i think he went to silver meadow to see if you were hanging around there .
just thought i 'd stop by .
what are you doing ?
sandy , you scared the shit out of me .
yeah .
i have to go to the bathroom .
they were old . and they could n't fly anyhow . i 'm going to get a radio-controlled airplane at christmas , and then i 'll stuff it full of m-80s and then fly it into mrs. burgess 's english class and blow it up .
the ones you built ?
all my model planes .
hey sandy , what were you blowing up out there ? your mom was pretty p.o . 'd .
well , you can ...
yeah ? see ya .
mikey was looking for you .
hey sandy .
hey wendy .
sure .
maybe you could drive him to spencer 's .
good .
detective dormer 's not leaving for a few hours .
did n't want to miss anything .
that 's all , for now .
yes , sir .
too bad ...
i have to get back .
it 's only gon na make you crazy .
i had him !
will , you ca n't blame yourself .
about how long 'til you heard the suspect 's second shot ?
and then i lost him . in the fog .
wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here .
that 's i.a . 's pit bull .
four unwarranted shootings , witness intimidation , and cocaine theft .
what 's the d.a . got them on ?
so far .
got a love affair with police work . drives me crazy with it .
nice kid .
what 's that , then ?
just after leland street .
do n't worry . i 'll have a cool scar .
what about your shoulder ?
why ?
no . but i covered it up . i lied .
byrd 's dead .
i know .
walter byrd killed kay connell . her things are in the house .
worth pursuing ?
it 's legitimate .
is n't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop ? a good cop ca n't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle 's missing . a bad cop ca n't sleep 'cause his conscience wo n't let him . you said that once , remember ?
not really .
about an hour ago . said he was more than happy to cooperate .
duggar called him ?
five feet ? seven feet ?
i do n't remember .
how much closer would you say you were ?
then change it .
but here 's the thing . i retraced your exact steps according to your statement . you could n't have seen detective eckhart from there . i mean , not in that fog .
okay .
i 'm going back to the lodge , ellie . still need to go through some of kay connell 's school records .
that must have been awful for you .
it 's okay . happened a long time ago . he was killed in a fire . in new mexico .
oh , i should n't have ...
twelve years younger .
she your only sibling ?
the puffins and the hawks . we 're in extra innings . the hawks have a really good line-up this year .
who 's playing ?
oh . we always have play-offs in the middle of the night . it 's the best time .
i could say the same thing about you .
call all of them from here to anchorage . tell them we now know that kay connell left the party with a dark blue knapsack , but we have n't recovered it yet . we can get it in by the morning editions .
yeah . all over .
this murder was in the papers , right ?
good . he 's up next .
the bartender at darrow 's . he was there friday night .
who 's that ?
but there was n't any ...
do it again .
we already did .
i want you to check this out , ellie .
down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in .
typical seventeen year-old . she went to a party friday night ?
it 's all about the small stuff . small lies . small mistakes . small oversights . people give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case . it 's human nature .
but they 're so boring . all small stuff .
do n't give misdemeanors a bad rap .
do n't worry about him ...
guess that 's what they call alaskan hospitality .
actually ...
you did your homework , officer .
detective eckhart ! i know ! welcome to nightmute !
my partner ...
we 'll get the other one , though .
right . got lost in the rocks .
oh , you know . do n't feel that much . bullet went right through .
anything . it 's important .
what i saw ?
that 's why i 'm here . i need to know exactly what you saw yesterday , farrell .
we just got ta catch the bastard , right ?
he would have liked that .
i wish i 'd had the chance to get to know him better . take him fishing or something .
thanks .
where is he ?
sorry about ...
this is a local writer . kay had all his books . i think we should check it out .
so ?
mrs. connell found this copy in the house . it 's signed . personally .
that 's right .
one of the paperbacks we found in kay connell 's knapsack .
no .
and something else that might interest you .
good .
i beeped you over two hours ago .
what ?
forget your pager ?
first i need a copy of the key .
i 'll call him now .
i 'm going to the hospital to talk to him now . you get the search party together . no fewer than thirty people . i 'll meet you in exactly twenty-five minutes . do n't waste any time .
dormer . still no sign of the bullet that went through farrell .
i told her to come .
what are you doing here ?
no .
i 'll stick it in the evidence locker ...
has her books in it .
we 're sure it 's hers ?
randy stetz . her boyfriend . we 've questioned him , searched his place . did n't find anything .
who was the last one to see her alive ?
around twelve-thirty .
what time was that ?
she left the party early . friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out .
like i said , no . we know about those things up here .
no fibers , skin flakes , hairs ...
no .
she 'd come to me , sometimes in the middle of the night . bruises all over her back , her upper arms . i pled with her to let me call the police , but she would n't hear it . wanted to keep it a secret .
are you sure about that ?
that 's right .
randy stetz ?
that boyfriend . randy .
how do you mean ?
she was n't happy . i was someone to talk to .
yes . not that much at first . but then she became more comfortable . started visiting me every week ...
did she ?
she flattered me about my writing . asked if she could visit me . to talk about my books .
what happened at that signing ?
that 's right .
where you signed this ?
you tell buck and i 'm involved whether i like it or not ...
you do n't have to be involved , will .
goddammit , hap . think about what you 're doing ...
i 'm thinking i could get off with probation . keep half my pension . that 's all i want .
do n't do this , hap ...
i wish i could stick it out like you . i just , with trish and the kids ...
will ?
looks like the natives are restless .
what are we thinking ?
well her mother did n't buy them for her .
mike flynn 's a dirty cop , hap ! we are nothing like mike flynn . we did what we needed to do to make sure that son-of- bitch dobbs paid for what he did . and every bastard like him . we say one word about it and every case we ever brought in is going to blow wide open and they 'll all walk . every last one . and i am < i > not < /i > going to let that happen . no deals . no compromises . no discussions .
cut some kind of a deal . i heard that 's what flynn 's doing ...
no way .
maybe not . we could talk to buck ...
one word to i.a . and he walks .
you know i remember that .
weston dobbs killed an eight year-old boy and left him hanging in the basement like a piece of meat . you remember that ?
we say nothing . it goes away . simple as that .
well , i got ta tell you . with a wife , three kids , and a pension plan in the balance , it 's rattling hard .
he 's just rattling your cage .
but he 's zeroing in on < i > me < /i > . on < i > us < /i > . everyone 's talking about it .
he 's asking everybody questions .
dammit , will . warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday . < i > five < /i > hours . asking all kinds of questions ...
that 's right .
to do nothing .
you know my plan of action .
when 's that , a week ? two weeks ? ... we have to figure out a plan of action now .
we 'll talk when we get back to seattle .
you know what about .
what do you want to talk about ?
even the best make mistakes .
he knew exactly what we 'd be looking for . made sure to cover up all his tracks .
i.a . 's calling themselves the `` corruption task force . '' can you believe that ? trying to root out any mistakes or `` oversights '' any other detectives may have made over the years . they 're turning it into a witch hunt . something on the news about it practically every night .
they 're all over everybody .
seven years .
eight years .
we 're under investigation now . back in seattle . hap wanted to talk . as soon as we got back . thought he could work out some kind of deal .
what if someone finds out ?
there 've been other cases . where we 've changed results . pushed witnesses . manipulated evidence . but dobbs . i wanted dobbs more than anything .
will .
me and hap . a year and a half ago . i knew the second i met dobbs that he was guilty . smug , cold . dead eyes . we had circumstantial evidence , but nothing to tie him to it . nothing concrete . went over every inch of that apartment .
one of your cases ?
there 's a guy down the hall . complaining about the noise . says he ca n't sleep .
what is it ?
will ... i ...
what did he look like ?
that 's not what he thinks .
i 'm not expecting anyone .
no . he did n't say what his name was . only that you were expecting him .
fred duggar ?
habit .
i got it . do n't know why i bother . it 's been broken for two years .
i 'm always all business .
your friend 's all business .
good to see you , too , randy .
thought i smelled something .
she did n't tell me .
you do n't know .
i do n't know .
fuck you , man ! - i 'm sick of all your fucking cop questions ...
ran like hell to go to him ...
how should i know ? ...
after that she left the party to go to him .
i told you i do n't remember .
the other guy ?
just stuff . i do n't fucking remember .
what kind of stuff ?
stuff .
friday night , at the party - what 'd you fight about ?
i do n't know what you 're fucking talking about .
but she was seeing someone else on the side .
she loved me . she wanted to see me every night .
you heard me that time .
huh ?
`` she was nice . '' wow . that makes me all soft inside . ever occur to you she did n't love you back ?
kay connell . did you love her ?
huh ?
did you love her ?
brody ... i do n't know ... ... something brody !
what was it ?
she used some stupid code name .
who ?
my arm !
who ?
she kept saying she was gon na get out of here . leave us all behind . that < i > he < /i > was going to take her !
what was ?
it was like some big fucking secret !
but you were such good < i > friends ... < /i >
she would n't tell me !
you do n't know .
i do n't know .
who was kay seeing besides randy stetz ?
no ...
told each other everything . that why your picture 's torn up in the top drawer of her bureau ?
that 's what i said .
you and kay were like sisters ?
thought you wanted something fun ...
hey ...
long as it 's fun .
you want me to take you somewhere ?
must be tough for you . what happened .
we were like sisters . knew everything about each other .
that 's a long time .
since grade school .
best friend ?
i was her best friend .
what are you doing in this shit-hole town ?
you 're not missing much .
i never met anyone from seattle before .
drop the gun , walter .
wild card .
procedure went out the window a long time ago .
you 're not following procedure .
no back-up .
where 's your back-up ?
if you want it to be ...
this an accident , walter ?
yes . like that .
it was when i went to kiss her . she started laughing . i got angry . after all i 'd given her . all i 'd shared with her . i just wanted to make her stop . that 's all .
could n't get it up , walter ?
i did n't want to kill her , will .
do n't you pull that shit with me .
then so was mine ...
i told you that was an accident !
kay told me . she comes to me , you know . tells me things . about you . about me .
what the hell do you know ?
but we work so well together ...
there 's nothing more to talk about .
i thought maybe we could talk some more .
congratulations .
told you i could write an ending .
randy stetz is in jail .
he . well , he ...
what about him ?
i gave her things she did n't have . could n't have .
does n't sound like a mentor to me .
yes .
expensive dresses . a heart necklace .
yes .
you gave her gifts .
i was a mentor to her .
but you wanted to .
no .
did you have sex with her ?
i suppose .
but she was an attractive girl .
she was only seventeen .
yes down at the station .
down at the station ?
you 're going to be brought in for questioning .
thought you might find that .
kay connell had a signed copy of one of your books .
oh ?
i said you 're going to get a phone call .
i 'm sorry ?
the phone call . the knapsack .
no game .
we are a pair , and that 's what counts .
what a pair we are . we deserve each other , do n't we ?
your melancholy eyes ...
you made me see their failings , louis . you made me look at them with your eyes .
you were their leader . they trusted you .
i knew . i rescued you , did n't i ? from the terrible dawn .
and yet you knew what i would o .
no .
you did n't even warm them , did you ?
i understand you only too well . you let them do it , as i let lestat turn a child into a demon . as i let her rip lestat 's heart to pieces ! well i am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it . your melancholy spirit of this century ! i know what i must do . and i warn you - you saved me tonight , so i return the favour - do not go near your cell in the theatre des vampires again .
louis , i swear i did not .
you held sway over them . they feared you . you wanted it to happen .
you let them do it .
louis , they can not be brought back . there are some things that are impossible , even for me .
i do n't believe you . i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie .
i could n't prevent it .
louis , i ca n't save her . i will only risk losing you -
you ca n't believe i 'd leave without her . armand ! you must save her ! you have no choice .
i ca n't save her .
not without claudia . where is she ?
follow me - that way - through my cell -
where is she ? where 's claudia ?
yes i knew him . knew him well enough not to mourn his passing .
lestat ! you knew lestat !
a vampire with a human soul . an immortal with a mortal 's passion . you are beautiful , my friend . lestat must have wept when he made you --
yes ... my god ...
are these not the answers you came for ?
like moths around the candle of the age . decadent , useless . they ca n't reflect anything . but you do . you reflect its broken heart .
and the vampires of the theatre ?
how he must have loved you .
that 's what the one who made me said .
you would never give up life . if the world were reduced to one empty cell , on fragile candle , you stay alive and study it . you see too clearly . you see too much .
we can do that ?
but you asked the wrong questions . do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality ? how quickly they perish of their own will .
you said there were none .
so soon ? without any of those answers you so longed for ?
then i leave too .
it 's already begun . if you want to save her , send her away .
we want no quarrel with him .
did you kill this vampire who made you both ? is that why you wo n't say his name ? santiago thinks you did .
then blame the one who made her ...
i could give you reasons . her silence . her youth . it 's forbidden to make so young , so helpless , that can not survive on its own .
but why ?
she is .
i 'm not innocent . but i 'm afraid . she feels she 's in danger from the others .
if you say so . you are innocent .
no , my beloved , my child .
your lover .
claudia is dear to me . my ... daughter .
listen to me .
i was waiting for you ...
knew ? you mean he is ...
he knew nothing . he just did n't care .
the one who made you should have told you this . the one who left the old world for the new ...
you fell too much . so much you make me feel ...
my god ... so it 's as i always feared . nothing , leading to nothing .
none that i 've ever known . i know nothing of god or the devil , i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul . and as far as i know , after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world .
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil ?
i have not spoken to him ...
then god does not exist ...
and perhaps this is the only real evil left ...
perhaps ...
then there is nothing .
i understand . i saw you in the theatre , your suffering , your sympathy for that girl . i saw you with the boy . you die when you kill , you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing . but does that make you evil ? or , since you comprehend what you call goodness , does it not make you good ?
no .
you mean we are not children of satan ?
that is a picture , nothing more .
but the one who made him , who made the one who made him , the source of all this evil ...
surely you know the one who made you ...
who made us what we are ?
nothing if not vampires ...
what are we ?
ah ! you have questions ?
so you have the answers ...
if there were a leader , i would be the one .
are you the leader of tis group ?
you do n't want to answer ... two vampires from the new world , come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away .
but how did you come into existence ?
we had feared we were the only ones ...
disappointing , is n't it ? to come so far and find so little . jaded ingenues , amusing themselves with make- believe ...
they did , but too fast for you to see them . no magic , just grace and speed .
your lips , they did n't move .
yes , and very beautiful .
monstrous .
i 'll put you in your coffin . forever .
louis , put me in my coffin ...
do n't louis --
yes . it killed them , unfortunately . but it keeps the blood warm .
laudanum !
no . laudanum .
absinthe ? you gave then absinthe ?
we forgive each other then ?
drunk on brandy wine . a thimblefull . i thought of you when i saw them .
oh , claudia , you 've outdone yourself . where did you find them ?
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess .
oh , lestat . i must do more than that . i 've brought a present for you .
stop pestering me then !
i came to make peace with you , even if you 're the father of lies . i want things to be as they were .
what plans ?
you 're a liar . but you upset my plans .
not you my dear .
i suppose we could people the world with vampires , the three of us .
you 're spoilt because you 're an only child . you need a brother . or i do . i 'm weary of you both .
is that supposed to frighten me ?
yes . and i 'll tell you something else ! i 've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you .
does it ?
what is it now ? you irritate me ! your very presence irritates me !
be glad i made you what you are ! you 'd be dead not if i had n't .
why yours alone ? tell me how it was done ! ! ! !
did you do it to me ? ? ? ?
stop her louis !
you made us what we are , did n't you ?
but it was n't always so ! i had a mother once ! and louis - he had a wife ! he was mortal the same as she ! and so was i !
it will grow back again !
and if i cut my hair again ?
what you are ? you would be something other than you are ?
which of you did it ? which of you made me the way i am ?
you dress me like a doll . you make my hair like a doll . why ?
but you 're the fairest by far .
i have . or there would be twice as many .
some of these are so old and tattered . you should throw them away .
is this my birthday ?
i did n't realise .
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year .
what night ? what do you mean ?
why always on this night ?
yes you are , my dearest . you are mine and louis ' daughter . you see louis was going to leave us . he was going to go away . but now he 's not . he 's going to stay and make you happy .
i 'm not your daughter .
it 's bet in the beginning , lest the death takes you down with it . yes , that 's it . my child . my beloved child .
i want some more .
yes , cherie , of course you want more . and i 'll show you how to get it . you drink from morals , my beauty , but from me ? never again .
more .
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman . it will take her many nights to die , perhaps yeaars . what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human .
what do you mean ?
bear me no ill will , my love . we are now even .
it 's only mortal death .
but if she dies ...
she is dying . it happened to you too , but your child 's mind ca n't remember .
and who will care for me my love , my dark angel , when you are gone ?
yes ...
oh god ! i love you still , that 's the torment of it . but you know i must leave you louis ...
yet you could do it to me ! snatching me from my mother 's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale ! could n't you have waited ? six more years and i would have had that shape ! and now you weep ! you have n't tears enough for what you 've done to me .
do n't make me , claudia ! i can not do it !
your evil is that you can not be evil ! and i will suffer for it no longer !
how do we seem to you ? do you think us beautiful , magical , our white skin , our fierce eyes ? drink , you ask me ! have you any idea of the thing you will become ?
you really believe that ?
he can protect us , claudia .
let him go , he said . let him go .
so you felt it too !
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word ? when he put me in that trance ...
that 's not so .
he wants you as you want him . he 's been waiting for you . he wants you for a companion . he bides his time that place . he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do .
never .
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you .
love ?
love holds you to me . and we are in danger , not you .
no , you would not , louis . danger hold you to me .
do you think i would let them harm you ?
i can feel it from them ! they want to know who made us , what became of him . they have their rules , their idiotic rules !
what danger ?
i lothe them ! i ca n't stand the sight of them ! stupid bourgeois parisians , all dressed in black like some private club ! i 've searched for them the world over and i despise them !
be still !
i 've seen enough of this ! i loathe it !
yes , and very beautiful .
this is monstrous !
and no one knows but us ...
this is no performance .
no . she 's frightened . she does n't know where she is .
she 's no vampire .
how devilishly clever .
they use no paint . and the audience think it is paint .
they are here . i know they are . listen for something that does n't make a sound .
mortals , mortals everywhere . and lots of drops to drink .
nonsense all right . but something tell me it 's going to be the strangest nonsense we 've ever seen .
but this ca n't be real . this is nonsense .
come , claudia ...
yes . should i take her , louis ? among her dolls ? make a doll of her in turn ?
you know her ?
you are neither , claudia . now stop this --
are they my kind louis ? dolls never change either .
you are more beautiful than any of them .
they are ducklings , that will grow into swans . whereas i must be the duckling forever .
claudia , you torture yourself .
or her , or her - or any of them ?
but how will i ever know , louis ?
it was something hurries ... and seldom savoured ... something acute that was quickly lost . it was the pale shadow of killing .
you do n't remember ? or you never knew .
well tell me , papa . what was it like making love ?
yes .
you want me to be your daughter forever , do n't you ?
yes ...
a beautiful child ! is that what you still think i am ?
still my beautiful child .
how do i look ?
not yet .
the ship is sailing wihout us !
it is ! take the back stairwell -
it ca n't be -
the workmen must have a trunk - do n't stop , cherie -
what was that ?
tell me you do n't hate me louis . i did it for you -
hush , claudia , hush now my dear -
i ca n't bear it when you do - i would die rather than lose you louis . i would die the way he died .
and you never cried -
you never talked to me like that - in all these years .
i ca n't . go away from me .
louis , look at me .
i did it for us , louis . so we could be free .
then maybe so do we . every night of our lives . he was my brother . my maker . he gave me this life , whatever it is .
he belongs with those reptiles , louis . he deserved to die .
and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing , and it goes back , nothing proceeding from nothing , until there is nothing ! and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge .
in europe , louis . we shall meet our own kind . find the one who made him . learn what it means .
the swamp ...
do n't mock , claudia ...
should we burn him ? bury him ? what would he have liked , louis ?
the one good lesson he taught me , louis . never drink from the dead .
he 's dead , claudia , dead .
do n't mock me , louis . help me .
lestat . oh , god forgive us .
he 'll never let us go .
but now 's the time to end it , louis . now 's the time to leave him .
i took your life . he gave you another one .
you both did it ?
and he found me with you . i ran , sickened at what i 'd done . then he cut his wrist and fed you from him . i tried to stop him , but you were a vampire then . and have been every night hereafter .
you ... fed on me ?
and it means something else too , does n't it ? i shall never , ever grow up .
you see the old woman ? that will never happen to you . you 'll never grow old . you will never die .
tell me why ... you 've got to tell me ...
we 're immortal . you 've always known that .
why not ?
claudia - do n't -
you want me to be a doll forever ?
sit still . it 's not finished -
claudia ! you did that ?
hush , claudia do n't talk about such things . show me your book .
why does he call you that ?
he jests .
infant death , he calls me . sweet daughter death . you know what he calls you ? merciful death .
lestat taught you all you need to know about that .
but you never let me see you kill , louis .
the way i learn everything . by watching you .
how did you learn to write , claudia ?
what have you done ?
i want more .
you have it ...
and the more you tried , the more i wanted you ... a vampire with your beautiful , suffering human heart . and how you suffered ... i need your forgiveness , louis .
i tried ...
i tried to tell you louis ... that night in paris ... when i first came to you ... no-one can refuse the dark gift , louis ... not even you .
yes . i remember ...
you remember how i was , louis.. the vampire lestat ...
i have to go now lestat ...
if you stayed with me louis , i could venture out ... little by little ... become the old lestat .
it 's false light , lestat . it ca n't harm you ...
you know i love the dark . but there 's no dark anymore .
and they frighten you ?
i ca n't bear it louis ! the machines out there , that fly and that roar ! and such lights ! they make the night brighter than the day !
it 's only a siren ...
you 've come back to me , louis ? you 've come again to me ?
do n't fear me , lestat . i bring you no harm .
still beautiful louis . you always were the strong one .
yes . past ... she should never have been one of us ...
that 's all past , lestat .
i did n't mean to let them do it ... that santiago , he tricked me ...
do n't try to speak ... it 's alright ...
i 'm so glad you 're here louis ... i 've dreamed of your coming ...
claudia ! ! !
you 'll come home with me louis ? fro a little while ... until i am myself again .
are you mad ? ? ? ?
no ... you come back to me louis ...
louis , louis , i gave you the gift -- - help me -- -
claudia ! do n't do this thing ! ! !
she would sleep in my coffin , daily , curl her child 's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what ...
claudia , claudia , will you never learn ? who will we get now to finish your dress ? a little practicality , cherie ...
shhhh ! do you want to frighten our little daughter ?
you are the devil ! you are the instrument of satan !
your mama 's left you with us . she wants you to be happy .
that 's enough , cherie . stop before the heart stops .
you are the devil ! you are the instrument of satan !
lestat , what do you mean ?
claudia , claudia , listen to me . you 're ill , my precious and i 'm going to give you what you need to get well .
do n't worry , louis , you 're conscience is clear . you left her alive .
i did n't want to kill her .
you remember how you wanted her , the taste of her -
lestat !
you need company , louis . more congenial than mine ...
what are you saying ?
she 's here , your wounded one .
ah , but we have even more in common with our creator . come , i am like a mother tonight . i want a child .
is god merciless ? greedy and cruel ?
evil is a point of view . god kills , indiscriminately , and so shall we . for no creatures under god are as we are , none so like him as ourselves .
that and more .
oh god lestat . i felt peace . i felt an end to the craving .
do what it is in your nature to do . and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms .
no ...
pain is terrible for you . you feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire . you do n't want it to go on .
in the old world , they called it the dark gift , louis . and i gave it to you .
my god ... to think you ... are all i have to learn from ...
then you kill her ! ! ! ! !
no ! ! !
unless i make her one of us ...
you finish her - if you feel so much -
lestat - finish this -
i like to do it . i enjoy it . take you aesthete 's taste to purer things . kill them swiftly if you will , but do it ! for now doubt , you are a killer louis . ah !
why do you do this lestat ?
i know . let her alone .
the girl , lestat -
vampires are killers . predators , who 's all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment .
lestat , she 's alive ! ! ! !
do n't you understand , louis , that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity ... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of god .
i do n't pretend to know .
what do you imagine you are louis ?
i 'm not interested in you . you disgust me . i 'm interested in my own nature and know i ca n't trust you to tell me the truth about me .
what , no flowery speeches ? about what a monster i am ? what a vulgar fiend ?
and what if there is no hell , or they do n't want us there ? ever think of that ?
we belong in hell .
where do you think , my idiot friend ? we 're in a nice filthy cemetery . does this make you happy ? is this fitting and proper enough ?
where are we ?
what you would n't do . it 's almost sunrise . it will be the sun or the fire . you said they can kill me . the sun or the fire !
you fool , what have you done ?
respect me a little then . i 'm the only life you know .
i respect life , do n't you see ? for each and every human life i have respect .
come the new orleans then . there 's an opera on tonight . a real french opera ! we can dine in splendour !
they know about us . they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses .
but you must know something about the meaning of it all , you must know where we come from , why we ...
i learnt absolutely nothing . i was n't give a choice , remember ?
tell me about him . you must have lernt something from him ! it had to happen for you as it did for me !
as did the one who made me .
paris ? you came from paris ?
consider yourself lucky . in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons . here all one needs is a pair of fangs .
i do n't know any hell -
what have you done to me ? you 've condemned me to hell .
the dark gift is different for each of us . but one thing is true of everyone . we grow stronger as we go along .
i ca n't .
read her thoughts .
but how do you know ?
the trick is not to think about it . see that one ? the widow st. clair ? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband . she 's perfect for you . go ahead .
of course not . it 's so easy you almost feel sorry for them .
have you ever been caught ?
anything is possible . but just try it for a week . come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport !
but we can live without taking human life . it 's possible .
yes . and i 'm bored with this prattle --
fascination ...
there 's nothing in the world now that does n't hold some ...
we can live like this ? off the blood of animals ?
i know . it gets cold so fast .
do you think so ?
you 'll get used to killing . just forget about that mortal coil . you 'll become accustomed to things all too quickly .
the sun will destroy the blood i 've given you . every tissue , every vein . the fire in this lantern could do that too .
and if i do n't ?
you must get into it . it 's the only safe place for you when the light comes .
give it time . you 're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain . it will pass . and we must sleep now . i can feel the sun approaching .
it ca n't be ...
yes , that 's you , my handsome friend . and you 'll look that way till the stars fall from heaven .
you 've killed louis . and enjoyed it .
dear god , what have i done ?
you have fed . you were made for this ...
what have i done ?
forget the crucifix . take him .
the crucifix -
take him .
i want a woman .
come , you 're going to feed now .
dying ?
you 're body 's dying . pay no attention . it will take twenty minutes at most .
sure ...
you 're sure ?
yes ...
did i hear a yes ?
you asked for death . i did n't promise it -
yes . kill me . kill me like you promised -
you really want to be with them ?
because you 're as strong as i was when i was alive .
but why do you want me ?
your perfect . your bitter and you 're strong .
i ca n't go through with it , i tell you .
i wish i were . but if i were , what would i want with you ?
you 're the devil , are n't you ? that 's who you are .
do n't worry . he was white trash , they come at two a penny . i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave , licked his wounds clean .
kill me if you will , but i ca n't do this ...
you 've just done it -
i ca n't do it .
let 's call that a start .
call him .
how do you mean , start ?
you let your overseer run riot , work your slaves to the bone . we 'll start with him .
i want it !
vampires . we thrive on blood .
give it to me ! ! !
you have to ask me for this . you have to want it , do you hear me ?
no ! ! ! ! !
they are gone , louis . death took them . death which you can now destroy ...
diane ! ! ! !
i 've come to answer your prayers . you want to die , do n't you ? life has no meaning anymore , does it ?
what do you want from me ?
why should i be ?
you 're not afraid of anything , are you ?
and a beautiful house it is too . yours is a good life , is n't it ?
who the hell are you ? what are you doing in my house ?
yes ...
you want death ? is it death you want ?
then my luck would have changed .
they would have killed you -
do n't say anymore . the reels are still turning . i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what i 've said .
no ...
dear god . i 've failed again , have n't i ?
if i could see what you 've seen , feel what you 've felt i would n't let it end like this ! you need a like to the world out there , a connection ... then it wo n't end like this ...
is this what you want ? you ask me for this after all i 've told you ?
you need a new passion , louis , a new reason to feel ... what a story you 've told , you do n't understand yourself .
it 's over , i 'm telling you ...
but you talk about passion , about longing , about things i 'll never know in my life ! it 's still inside you , in every syllable you speak ! and then you tell me it ends like that ? just empty ?
but it has . there is no more to tell .
no ... it ca n't end like that ...
he had n't even been there . and all those years i thought he was dead .
lestat escaped the fire !
fictions , my friend . the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman ... so we repaired to paris ...
no vampires in transylvania ? no count dracula ?
peasant rumours , superstitions about garlic , crosses , stakes in the hear , all that - how do you say again ? bull shit . but one of our kind ? not a whisper .
you found nothing ?
he was dead to us . we were free . that was all that mattered .
did he die in the fire ?
where would she have gone ? she was a child , and beautiful , heartbreaking merciless child . and i had made her that ...
and did you lose her ? did she go ?
how could i not ? she had to know .
but why did you tell her ?
perhaps . he knew me . he knew i would love her more than the waking world . but there was more to it than that . perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could . for he lavished affection on her , there was no doubt about that . life was very different with madame claudia , as you can imagine ...
he did it to make you stay with him !
shall we go on ?
i was human then . might as well ask can an angel feel love . both are blesses or cursed with a certain ... detachment . though whether angels take as long to learn it as i , i will never know .
you loved your wife , surely .
can a vampire feel love ?
you loved yvette ...
coffins ... coffins unfortunately are a necessity ...
what about coffins ?
the same . as you would say today ... bull shit .
the story about stakes through the heart ?
nonsense , my friend . i can look on anything i like . and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes .
you ca n't look at them ...
oh , that rumour about crosses ?
you said the slave had a crucifix ...
but times were different then . i was a man at that age . the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans ...
yes .
why should i lie ? 1791 was the year it happened . i was twenty-four - younger than you are now .
you 're not lying to me , are you ?
what can i do to put you at ease ? shall we begin like david copperfield ? i am born , i grow up . or shall we begin when i was born to darkness , as i call it . that 's really where we should start , do n't you think ?
the same way you do it . a series of simple gestures . only i moved too fast for you to see . i 'm flesh and blood , you see . but not human . i have n't been human for two hundred years .
how did you do that ?
we love it . i only wanted to prepare you .
but i thought vampires did n't like the light .
we ca n't begin this way . let me turn on the light .
you believe this , do n't you ? that you 're a vampire ? you really think ...
yes but you need n't worry about that now . things change .
you were going to kill me ? drink my blood ?
perhaps lucky for both of us .
well , what a lucky break for me .
absolutely . i was watching you watching me . i was waiting for you in that alleyway . and then you began to speak .
see ? i knew you were interesting . you mean this literally , i take it ?
i 'm a vampire .
so shall we begin ? what do yo do ?
it 's just a room ...
saw you in the street outside . you seemed interesting . is this where you live ?
you followed me here , did n't you ?
so much the better . i 've got a pocket full of tapes .
you 'd have to have a lot of tape for my story . i 've had a very unusual life .
that 's what i do . i interview people . i collect lives . f.m . radio . f.f.r.c . i just interviewed a genuine hero , a cop who -
so you want me to tell you the story of my life ...
yes !
look at the gaslight . do n't tke your eyes off it . you will be drained to the point of death , but you must stay alive . do you hear me ?
my daughter ...
and the child who did die ?
a child who ca n't die ...
what do you think she is , madeleine ? a doll ?
yes .
and you know what you ask for ?
yes ...
you promise to care for her then ?
au contraire , monsieur , i have .
you have n't the vaguest conception under god of what you ask !
i 'd call this four spoiled city kids who would n't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts . all we can do now is batten down and ride it out . if things get really bad , there 's a storm shelter .
what the hell would you call this ?
sorry . emergencies only .
what about a radio ?
duh . the next couple of days is gon na be rough , but we 'll make it .
july fourth weekend . storm season starts today . the clouds roll in like clockwork .
wait ... did you say off-season ?
and , while you 're here , our marginally trained , off-season staff of five will attend to your every need .
julie , we 're talkin ' suites ! that 'll be just fine with us .
not at all . those are our honeymoon suites .
is that bad ?
you 're in 201 and 202 .
checking in ... karla wilson .
what can i do for you ?
phones went down a few minutes ago .
then i 'll call the mainland for a charter .
not possible , i 'm afraid . the last ferry left hours ago . and we got a storm coming . there wo n't be another one for days .
i want off this island .
who ? who is here ?
listen to me . he 's here .
it 's our version of winter . 201 and 202. there 's scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby . enjoy .
storm season ?
we have n't exchanged anything .
honeymoon suites . i take it you kids have n't exchanged vows , yet ?
your what ?
built in 1948 for a member of the rockefeller clan . the tile work was imported from spain . a lot of history in these walls ... judy garland stayed here ... hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
it sure is a beautiful old hotel .
the guy looks dead .
no .
i do n't know , man . maybe we should keep going , find a phone --
no way , man . surprise her . she 'll be psyched .
i should go up there . i should call her back , tell her i 'm coming .
jeez , ray , fourth and forty , throw the bomb .
stupid . what were you thinkng ?
stupid . stupid .
idiot . idiot . idiot .
you 'll go away with you 're college friends , but you wo n't go away with me ?
up-tighteous and self-righteous .
i got work to do . take the bake elsewhere .
storm is what makes it interesting . thass why all the fish are up . less hook us a couple big ones .
there 's a storm comin ' , titus . no boats are going out .
that 's why you 'll come with titus , mon .
titus , you 're so stoned , you 'd end up in spain .
fish are all over the water ... come on , let us take a boat out .
get lost , you scared me .
is he ?
you 're okay . thank god .
oh , god , it 's you --
... nancy ?
no , you 're not .
i 'm holding your hand !
i 'm right here . grab my hand .
julie ?
come on , you can make it .
i do n't know ...
what do we do ?
there 's no way to lock it .
it 's too late for that .
karla , i just wanted the whole thing to be over . i did n't want to involve anybody else .
i 'm your best friend ... you could have told me the truth about what happened . i would 've understood .
then , we fight --
julie , the boats are gone , the phones are down . there 's no way off this place .
i 've got to see .
be careful , julie .
we 'll be better off in the open . if we stick together , maybe we can kill this creep for good .
i know i do n't want to stay in here .
rio is n't the capital of brazil . it was the wrong answer . sorry , we lose .
what do you mean ?
come on , julie . you saw his room .
let him go . i believe him .
only he was n't dead . he killed barry and helen last july fourth .
julie ...
they never found the body .
oh , stop it ! he 's dead . you killed him . now , get over it . we got ta think here .
i think we can classify this as an emergency situation .
i 'm not crazy ... i 'm not crazy . he 's here ... we 've got to get to the radio and call for help .
just kidding .
karla !
no , this is the safe sun . it 's better than a day at the beach .
cancer in a box .
i 'll be givin ' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it .
nice move .
hey , slow down , turn off the little motor up in there ... what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress ?
it 's okay ... he does n't believe me . that 's his right . i 'm starting to think i 'm crazy , too .
some .
you get any sleep at all ?
the dockhand guy . hanging by his neck from up there .
think about this , julie . what did you actually see ?
not me ... no way ...
yes .
no .
yes .
no way .
okay , i wo n't .
do n't even think about it .
karaoke -- perfect .
i miss ray ... i tried to call him .
he 's cute ... and he 's got a crush on you ... but ...
am i bad ? i mean , he 's really great , and he 's cute --
i also promised tyrell .
karla ! you promised .
their stuff in there ... ... and ours in here .
where is everyone ? i 'll ask --
hello ? hello ?
i will , and you remind me of the same thing .
remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin ' i do for a weekend once every ten years .
no , i 'm the king of the world .
i 'm the king of the world .
hey , sorry ... he 's my friend , too . and that ticket is not going to waste .
oh !
then , do n't .
work hard , huh ? he 's breaking your heart just because he can . and i do n't want to have to say i told you so ...
he does work hard .
he said he 'd try . try is like maybe . try is nothing !
but , he said he 'd try .
julie , you left four messages ... four .
he 's not coming . i thought he was just ...
ray , come on . i want us to be together .
you got ta sell his butt on the bahamas ?
i know it , and it feels good . hi , ty .
okay , okay . you 're right .
would you relax ? we 've been dating three months . he ai n't stalking your butt .
the number 's unlisted ...
julie , people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers . it 's a fact .
that could break the machine .
nope . i told him that you absolutely , positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight . and then he came anyway .
karla ! did you tell him i 'd be here ?
tyrell , i appreciate it , but have you seen my people dance ? we make the mouth face , we move the fingers --
no means yes .
no .
say yes .
yet . nothing yet .
there 's nothing between will and me .
listen to me , julie . ray 's a great guy , nothing against old ray , but he 's so ... ray . i mean , he lives in southport . will 's a nice guy , too , and he lives right down the street .
i think i just really hurt ray 's feelings .
yeah , right -- whatever .
i 'm not going anywhere . i 'm fat , ugly , and depressed .
no . when i put these skinny pants on my body ... now , that 's heart attack time .
that was heart attack time , karla .
i just wanted your black pants , but i 'm not ready to die for them !
what are you doing in my closet ?
i thought you were out of town !
what are you doing in my closet ?
i thought you were out of town !
you know me to well .
checking the locks again ?
it 's gon na be great .
i love it here .
hey -- i did n't know you were here . it 's okay . we got the refrigerator in . come see .
never do that again .
oh ... it 's not working right . you 're home early . did i scare you ?
ray ... what are you doing ?
ray ... please try . i really miss you . okay . bye .
okay , i 'll try . but , listen ... if i do n't make it up , then you go ahead and have a great time .
will you try ... for me , please ?
julie , we 're working a big run up here . it 's been crazy . we probably have to go out again tonight . i do n't think i can do it .
this weekend ?
we 'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun , drink fruity drinks , and swim , and ... you know ...
what ? the bahamas ? you 're kidding .
ray , karla won a trip to the bahamas ! an island called tower bay . and she wants us to come with her .
it 's okay .
no , i should n't have left so fast ... i was just ...
no , you do n't have to be sorry . i 'm the one --
hey . i 'm really glad you called ... i 'm sorry .
it 's not like that . it 's not you . it 's me . my head . i want to go back . i want to be with you . i want to be fine . i want everything to be like it used to be . it just is n't .
i understand something .
i just feel like some part of me has n't healed up enough to go back . like some critical piece is missing . please understand ...
ca n't what ?
ray , i ca n't ...
why are you being like this ?
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first .
ray , we 're just friend .
yeah .
oh , that 's will . he 's a friend . you 'd like him .
i got in early . i was excited ... who was that guy ?
wait , it 's nancy --
do n't kill me --
you never do ... the guy at the nightclub , the body in your room last night . little notes that only mean something to you . how do we even know you 're not the one behind this --
i do n't know .
you 've got all these theories but where is he ? where ? where 's your fisherman killer ?
i told you .
voodoo .
ben willis .
who ?
we 're all going to die . he 's going to kill us one by one .
fine . show me the body .
i am not crazy , tyrell . he was right there .
that 's right . it 's how the species survives . you 'll never convince me otherwise . wan na dance ?
tyrell , you are an unstoppable force of nature .
you 're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight , jules .
why ? come on , julie . think . you 'll get it . will benson -- ben 's son .
... why ?
we had a connection , did n't we ? i can tell you one thing , though . ray did n't trust me . he was right . he 's dead , but he was right .
i trusted you .
me , me , me . it 's always about you . i 'm having bad dreams . i ca n't sleep . i 'm not doing well in school . i 'm having trouble with my boyfriend .
why are you doing this to me ?
i guess so .
he 's in it with willis ?
estes came after me with a gaffing hook .
did you get help ?
come on . we 're gon na be okay .
i was n't dreaming .
julie , you said you were tired . waybe you were dreaming .
there was a body ! i swear it !
it 's in my room !
what ? what are you talking about ? where ?
are you sure ? i really appreciate it .
hey , you do n't have to appologize to me . i 'm the one . i understand . i 'm going to take a walk and dry off .
no -- it 's not that . it 's ... i 'm just a little on edge . i 'm really sorry .
i scared you -- i crossed the line --
no , no , no . this was really sweet ...
it 's my fault . i should n't have ... i did n't think ...
oh , will ! i 'm sorry .
he did something to the screen ... it , it , said ...
what do you mean , julie ?
it 's ... him .
julie ? what 's wrong ?
you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand .
sure . it 's fine . as long as you do n't snore .
you sure it 's okay with you ?
it beets being on the mainland .
and it 's been blue skies all day . it might be perfect all weekend .
right . planes get hit by lightning . they get hit by meteors . they hit other planes .
you 've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning .
fumes build up in the fuel tanks . you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet . planes use o-rings ... which freeze in tap water . planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all .
deep breaths --
what if i do n't have anything happy from childhood ... sorry , i ca n't relax going five hundred miles an hour , or four thousand , four hundred feet a minute ... which is over seven hundred feet a second . imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second .
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood .
i said , this ... do you want a drink ?
what ?
this was not my idea .
are you sure ?
i 'm okay .
nah . i 'll probably just be here studying for finals . the joys of summer school ... are you okay ?
right . now i remember .
to get out of southport ?
i 'm trying . i really am ... sometimes i do n't even know why i came up here in the first place .
it 's ... the anniversary . that 's what 's going on ... take it easy on yourself .
it was one year ago ...
it ca n't get worse . i mean , it 's not like this was the first time i freaked out in class . i hardly ever get a full night 's sleep , my grades suck , i 'm this close from being thrown out of school .
it just takes time , julie . it 's gon na get better .
i thought i was over the dreams for good . i really did . i had n't had one for months .
i 'm sorry .
it was in a church ... it was so real . i mean , i could feel his breath on me .
the shower again ?
you do n't seem fine .
i 'm fine .
you sure ?
i 'm fine .
julie ! wait ! you okay ?
i do n't know , but i 'm starving .
you think that 's a good place to hide ?
i 'm not hiding up no tree . i 'm with her . let 's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho 's butt .
maybe we should just wait here ? hide in a tree ?
are you crazy ? we 're not staying here on our own .
i 'll come with you .
we got ta get out of here . now .
somebody ... is a sick , fingerpainting psycho .
see any dead bodies out there ? any fresh kill ? how 'bout freddy , jason ?
hey --
oh , look . another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director ... miss psychotic episode .
i 'd hate for you to have to blow ... your whistle .
i used to be a lifeguard ... i 'd hate to have to blow my whistle .
baby , i finally got you alone in this jacuzzi and i do n't wan na be discussin ' hair care .
okay , i just did n't wan na get my hair wet .
hello ?
you sure you did n't pick up my hair tie ?
'cause that 's the only way i 'm ever gon na be able to afford a big bed like this .
why ?
tha 's it . i 've decided . i 'm changing my major to finance . and going to wall street .
they all start to look the same once you 've worked in one . am i right , sister ?
pretty cool bar .
rio , baby !
guess the capital of brazil --
somebody 's gone tropical on us , baby . tropical !
oooh , the mainland --
we will , baby ... all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves .
ai n't nothin ' free in this world . everybody says it , and it 's true . i wanted you all to have a good trip .
honey , some folks just ca n't fly .
something is gon na hit your butt if you do n't quit complaining .
where there 's a will , there 's a way . come on .
is there a problem here ?
come on , i 'll take a break and we 'll all dance .
worse comes to worse , you can stand there and watch me .
i 'll talk real slow .
if you can say all you got ta say in a minute then i do n't wan na hear it .
just for a minute , baby . i got something i wan na tell you .
i do n't think so . it 's pretty crowded .
you know what i want to do to you ... right now , do n't you ? there 's got ta be somewhere we can be alone .
he 's probably the only one who can help us .
why ? he ca n't help us .
alone . in the room . got any advise ?
how 's julie ?
ahh , that feels great .
ladies and gentlemen , please put your hands together for my friend , my very best friend , julie james .
come on , it 'll be fun .
yeah , a great weekend . forget the weather !
to a great weekend --
i said we start having fun . and that means now .
julie , is everything cool ? karla said ...
we 'll call you back with all the details ... so what 's your favorite radio station ?
waaaaahhhhhhhhhh !
no . yes ?
oh , no ... did you say rio ?
rio de janeiro !
okay , karla , five seconds . five ... four ...
still here ... thinking ... you mean brazil , the country ?
yes !
how 'd you like to win a magic 96.7 quicky getaway ?
well , i 'm in school and --
well , karla , what 're you doin ' at home over the long fourth weekend ?
mark in the morning ! magic 96.7 ! oh my god ! i 'm karla . karla wilson . jules , it 's mark in the morning .
i 'm not waiting ... so give me the gun and keep the ring .
hell , that 's worth three , easy . and you got your waiting period .
make it three hundred . and throw that in , too .
do n't really have the market for something like this ... i can go two ... two-fifty .
how much ?
well , there 's some flaws in her ...
how much ?
jeez , that 's a full carat --
excuse me , but this island did n't have a murder rate until you people showed up . i 've never seen a dead body before .
must have missed the sign .
you stumbled into my hiding place .
and so could you -- crazy fool .
i 'm sorry , but you could 've been the one doing all of this --
the rest of us see bathrobes .
cool .
julie thinks there 's a dead guy in the closet .
what 's going on ?
no . i shot him .
he leave you ?
not anymore .
what 's the matter , boy trouble ?
wan na drink ?
tell me this ai n't the bar scene .
you guys lost ?
i 'll go find him .
what is up with that weirdo ?
where 'd estes go ?
yeah , wait right here , it 's the safest place .
we 'll only be a second , okay ?
estes ! that 's exactly who it is . that old guy knows something . we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first .
the porter ... what 's his name ? old asbestos --
julie ? wan na tell us what is going on here ?
they were cut loose .
and do what with it ?
take this .
hey -- shut up , okay ?
you know , the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
they 're around ... they just do n't care about us 'cause we 're the contest winners . let 's go find stoner boy ... make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or ping-pong paddles or something .
they 're all dead ... dead , i tell you . ahhhh , we 're all deaaaddddd . tyrellll , joinnnn usss .
where is everybody ?
you do n't have to be a jerk .
i 'm just saying what all of you are thinking . it 's bad enough gettin ' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time .
crowded .
how 's the water ?
there 's ten people on this whole island and they 're all gon na end up in this jacuzzi with us .
so why are you still here ?
the last day of the season . yeah , we heard .
planter 's punch , singapore sling , or how about a mai-tai ?
we did n't get all dressed up for nothing .
see , it 's not a macho thing . it 's about equilibrium in your inner ear . you could 've used a patch , but it 's too late now . get used to it . some folks just ca n't sail .
ca n't talk right now .
she 's in her room .
where is miss wollsten ?
the greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure -- a journey to another world . but i have my other guests to think of -- the general will be wanting to go back to his army . if you 'll excuse me --
how disappointing ! i expected it was something more romantic . a temple to the goddess of love , perhaps .
this was the temple of hades -- the god of the dead . it contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry .
how clover you are , mr. albrecht , to see all that in our simple thea ... she is quite pretty , is n't she ?
you do n't have to . it 's inside of you -- all the glory that was greece - the dancing , the singing and the white marble --
may life be good to you both . as for the others they will be quiet here and i will be with them .
goodbye .
thank you , i 'll do that . good night .
go ahead . i 'll wake you up when i go to bed . then you can watch him .
well
do n't bother . go to bed and get some sleep . i 'll be working late . i can hear any movement down here .
all the more reason to watch him . he 's had some wild notions lately .
he wo n't even know you 're there . he is delirious .
i 'll go up and take a look at the general - perhaps sit with him .
our friend , poseidon , did n't use it for fishing . he raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves .
it does n't look much like the fish spears i knew back in marblehead..
in case you do so , would you --
i 'd like to , very much -- but it depends on what dispatches are waiting for me on the mainland .
or even spirit messages from the next world .
i wonder if my editor 's psychic ? reports from the greek front are going to be a little vague .
that staggering . his dying so quickly . in your campaigns , have you never seen men who staggered before they died , who talked incoherently walked blindly .
he complained of not feeling well . i thought he was drunk he staggered .
he 's dead . i want the general to see him .
drunk again ?
i need your advice something has happened mr. jacks
why do n't you stay here tonight ? get a good sleep . you can return to your command in the morning .
he is exhausted .
you collect these to sell , abroad ?
but the gods played a little trick on me . i was born in switzerland .
it is my home . my name is hugo albrecht .
this is general nikolas pherides , commander of the third army . i 'm oliver davis . to be perfectly frank with you , we did n't expect to find anyone living here .
i took it for granted you gentlemen were refugees as are my other guests .
i must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him i am not afraid --
i 'm here . the general is here . you are not alone .
you can have your servants prepare a dinner . that is the way i 'll meet my old- familiar enemy -- death -- i have fought him before . i 've won often . now he wins . let him come for me at my own banquet .
my friend -- what can one say --
) you feel the symptoms ?
i just came to see if your prayer would entertain me as much as my medicine seems to amuse you .
i suppose you want to hear my prayer to hermes .
very well . i 'll wager a dinner .
we will see who is the first to die .
let us put it to the test . protect yourself with every scientific precaution you can think of . i 'll go out on the cliff and build a votive fire to hermes -- not that i believe in him any more than i do in science .
you 're just talking nonsense .
i have lived long enough to doubt everything -- which is to say , i believe everything , a little .
she 's right . this is hardly the time to bandy old tales .
they used to believe that sort of thing in the mountain villages . some still do --
the ancient greeks had just as good an explanation -- that the gods sent the plague to punish mortals for harboring vrykolaka --
good winds and bad winds !
if the wind shifts , if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the south -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours .
maybe you 're right . help me get something to carry her downstairs .
no . she shall not be left here .
another sad task . we 'll bury her tomorrow . i think we 'd better lock the door for tonight . it will make them less uncomfortable .
did your servant got word to dr. drossos ?
that 's impossible . i told them jacks died of a sudden heart attack , probably brought on by over drinking .
did you hear what thea said -- as if she knew what threatens us .
in the meantime it would be useless to alarm the others . let them think it was a normal and , perhaps it was - perhaps it was .
we will know when the next one sickens . until then you and i remain here . i will not bring the plague to my troops .
i 'm not sure that it is the plague .
i 'll get ida to make up your bed .
perhaps i had better stay . i am tired .
i donut understand .
i 'm afraid so . there were rumors people were aroused . some feared restlessness among the dead you know , the old superstitions .
all the graves ?
there was some trouble here the villagers on the mainland -this island was the focal point of their anger . they came here broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves .
but why ?
they were gore before i came here .
the enemy is in retreat . there will be no more fighting here . i came here to visit the crypts . my wife was buried here . what happened to the bodies ?
this was once a cemetery .
i have not been on the island in twenty years . it is changed - changed completely . where are the graves -- the coffins ?
i do n't know now without my father .
if mr. albrecht is right , we 'll all be free in a few days . i suppose you 'll be going on to athens ?
if only we could get away - - you and i. the others are strangers , they mean nothing to me
there 's no reason to decide any of us are going to die .
last night dr. drossos -- today you or i -- oh , no , oliver , it ca n't be you , i could n't stand it .
poor cathy --
my father -- i 'm alone , oliver , completely alone !
closer and closer - until they bite into your throat !
sharp , shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
tell me about them , thea . they have great wings end long teeth --
on my word ! that 's what they believe .
oh , no - it 's too delicious ! you 're making it up !
i think she went to bed i saw her going toward the house
where 's thea ?
no one can take my father 's place .
i know it must be hard . but you have relatives in london -- you 've got a whole world of living , ahead of you --
i think not .
you 're not leaving tomorrow.. ?
sleep well .
good night , oliver .
thank you .
how could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
i 'm glad you and the general did n't have to leave us . we would feel quite deserted..
of course . tomorrow , perhaps , before i go ?
i adore hearing thea sing -- but my poor head 's beginning to ache . i 'm so sorry .
m~ father will take care of it . pappa is wonderful ! no matter what happens , he makes me feel perfectly safe . i could never leave him . i should be utterly helpless by myself .
i hope mr. jacks gets to bed in one piece .
that was my companion . she sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice , of course .
you were singing , were n't you ? a beautiful voice , miss st. aubyn .
they shall not hurt you
shh it 's all right - i 'll be all right .
in the morning -- go . i 'll not die until then - i 'll not die i 'll watch - they shall not hurt you .
it 's getting dark . i ca n't leave now .
no , that 's thea 's bed . miss wollsten 's bed is in there .
miss wollsten shares the room with you ?
how kind you are . it is so comforting to know that someone cares .
i have been troubled about you . i want you to know that my room is just downstairs -- you have only to cry out if you are ill or frightened .
i was looking for you .
what are you doing ?
how old is she ?
she has never mentioned her family .
has she spoken to you of her father and her mother ?
some village in the mountains -- alethera , i think .
has that girl -- has thea ever told you where she comes from ?
i 'm so ill , i 'm so exhausted -- i almost do n't care .
poor child . these must be horrible days for you .
we quarreled . she never dared get angry or frightened -- but i said things to her -- it was an attack , i know it was .
it was , the plague
suppose , she is n't dead . suppose it was a cataleptic attack ?
she is dead at peace .
when i close my eyes , i see miss wollsten . i ca n't think of anything else .
you should sleep , cathy . lie down and close your eyes . try to forget everything .
i will let him go . he is dead to me as he is to all my mother 's people . i turn my hand against him .
that should decide it or you --
i felt he did not like me .
i do n't know . as a child . i longed for a father and now - i do n't know
come , thea , if you 're going to claim him as your father you 've got to make up your mind . they 'll be leaving any minute .
the general you do n't even know him .
but one must love a father .
thea , your choice is a very simple one . either you want to claim him as your father , or you do not .
my last name is pherides .
i have forgotten it , dear .
you have forgotten my last name ?
what is it -- what are you talking about ?
i do not know him , but i have seen him .
thea -- you 're hiding something . why do you suddenly speak of your father ? you told me once you had never seen him -- did n't know him --
why , i love my father because - because i do . of course , he 's nice to me .
i mean , does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one 's father ?
what an odd question !
cathy - how does it feel to have a father ?
thea is an orphan .
you are fortunate in your father .
and the soldier -- he looked at me so strangely -- who is he ?
the young man , mr. davis , seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer a correspondent of some sort
would n't i ?
you would n't tell that
when i tell him that you 're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic !
you 'd do anything to get oliver away from thea . but i 'm going to stop you . i 'm going to tell mr. davis exactly what you are .
really , this is idiotic !
you 've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man working at him turning him against thea .
would you care to explain what you 're talking about ?
i 've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours but this , cathy -- even i would never have believed it is of you .
no . i mean your other secret - the one you kept bidden even from my father . that old doctor in london -- he told me .
that your father and i
you will not say one single word . i know your secret .
you 're planing something , cathy.. but i wo n't let you - i 'll warn them against you .
why , i 'm fond of thea .
) but thea -- she stands in your way . i know you . i know your little hints the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
what if he is ?
mr. davis seems a good prospect young handsome , sympathetic -- ready to listen to you and feel sorry for you - -
what would i be thinking ?
did n't you ? but now -- what are you thinking now ?
you were father 's secretary - i never thought - -
your father loved me . he wanted to marry me . but he was afraid of hurting the gentle , delicate cathy . you spoiled his life you 've ruined mine
how do you know what my father thought - -
your father knew it too . but he was never sure how much was pretense .
you and your mysterious illness . a new attack everytime you are crossed everytime you ca n't get your own way .
miss wollsten !
they were talking about the vrykolakas this morning . cathy , that 's what you are a weak , pale , half-dead thing that drains all the life and joy from those who want to live .
whet do you mean ?
i wish i did n't have such bitter knowledge of you , cathy .
never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead . i will see to it that you do not walk about again . i promise you that . there is another one here who can not die . i will watch you both . never fear .
that 's superstition . that 's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - i 'm talking of something else -- cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real .
you ask that of me ? you 're afraid to live in your coffin . you know what that means ?
no , i want more than that . i beg you general , make sure -- drive a knife through my heart -- anything .
if you should fall sick we 'll be careful . you need not worry .
i do n't want to be buried alive . if i die i want to be sure - quite sure .
i do n't understand you .
i have not had a happy life -- but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - i want to avoid it .
yes ?
i 'm a woman -- a lonely woman . i have few friends .
he 's dead enough . god rest his soul .
because he was a brave man - because i liked him -- i came here to be sure .
he sleeps quietly . he died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man , drossos , like his father before him .
i wanted to be sure of something , general -- something that has always preyed on my mind . i have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in - entombed imprisoned..
woman , what are you doing here ?
i do n't care who he is . he does n't know . he ca n't tell
this is dr. drossos , chief medical officer of my division .
no . no . i wo n't believe it . he 's not dead .
i will go with you .
this girl -- thea - is not a servant in my household , sir . she is my daughter 's companion . now , sir , if you 'll excuse me , i 'll go have a look at mr. jacks .
this girl --
why -- no not before thea came
was she ill before that girl came into your household ?
nothing , really . she 's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
what is her illness ?
she 's not too well .
your daughter is ill .
miss wollsten - my secretary , she 'd know .
you do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came ?
damn me , if i know . she 's become so much a member of our household i never think of her by any name but thea -- she has a last name --
her family name ?
theodosia .
her name is thea ?
i do n't really know where thea comes from . the viceconsul at adrianople brought her to me..
she was born before your wife returned here to die . you never knew .
daughter -- my daughter --
not theodosia . theodosia 's daughter -- your daughter .
theodosia --
i shall not leave the island
come - you 'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island .
i have had command for the last time -
when you make sense i 'll listen .
listen to what i say --
that 's ridiculous -- thea 's lovely , gentle -
if i told you you would n't believe me -- but this much i can tell you the girl is dangerous to you . take a friend 's advice -- an old man ' s advice -- leave her alone -
and i 'm your friend but that does n't explain why you are always trying to come between thea and me ?
you are my friend .
i had a notion you had become selfappointed chaperone lately why ?
in a way -- this girl , thea . you must stay away from her .
is this what you wanted to speak to me about ?
i don ' t know . when i was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance . they bore her away with them . months later she came back pale -- sick -- she died --
how did she die ?
she was beautiful . there was blood between her family and my kin . but that did not stop me from taking her when i saw her beauty , nor did it stop her from loving me .
if she looked like thea , she must have been beautiful .
thea is so like her in every feature
dr. drossos will tell us . we will know what to do then .
we still do n't know that it 's the plague
better no general than one carrying the plague .
but the war , the army they need you .
until we know , what choice is there ? we have to stay .
the rider on the pale horse is pestilence . he follows the wars .
plague ? there 's no possibility of that , is there ?
i 've seen men die drunk - and i 've seen men die of the plague .
we have no time for that .
well , at any rate , i would like to say goodbye to the girl .
it is not necessary to understand . we are leaving and i am thankful .
i ca n't understand that .
it makes me fear her .
but that should make you like her .
i know all you are going to say -i have been saying it to myself , but the thought will not leave my mind . she resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves the way she turns her head .
oh , now now look here
there is something evil about her .
thea ?
i will be glad to leave this island . it has too much of that old dark world about it . i will be glad to leave it and that girl
it does n't seem to bother you much , general .
you are a happy man oliver . you have but one world to live in - the world of today . i have two worlds . i have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which i was brought up and a new world which the army gave me a world of mathematics , gun ranges , logistics , tactics , strategy .
maybe you 've got the wrong crypt after all it 's twenty years when you wore last here .
she is not there . the coffin is gone .
i 'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you .
there 's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead .
do you mind if i go with you ?
you were at those battles as a spectator i wonder if you can think what that sound might mean to me those men out there dead or dying by my order -- because i willed it so .
i heard the same sound at ladysmith , at nukden , port arthur . what do you expect after a battle ?
you know that sound , oliver ?
in the new york morning globe , the man who wins victory is always a hero . -
hero ?
why not take the doctor 's advice ? you 're the hero of the battle of corphon .
no -- you mus n't . he thinks i 've bewitched you . he wo n't believe it - he 'll hate me even more ! my only chance is to stay away from him .
let me tell him . when he knows you are his child , he 'll forget these insane notions -
for a moment , when he looked at me so sadly , i felt that i had wronged him . but then --
because she loved him . i know him , thea . believe me , he is not a cruel man .
then why does he persecute me ? my family told me what kind of man he is , how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
i do n't think so , thea . he has spoken of your mother . i do n't believe he knows you are his daughter .
it is for that he hates me .
thea , what is this ? what are you trying to tell me ? `` he stole your mother '' -
it is more than a feud between two families . he stole my mother away from her people .
i knew that feuds still went on , but i did n't think people like you and the general would be involved .
he hates all my race .
why in the world ca n't you ?
i ca n't .
well , tell , him .
he keeps asking for the name of my father and mother .
oh , that vrykolaka business . you must n't be too angry with him , thea . he 's an old man and now with all this trouble the disappointment in not being able to lead his own army to victory -- cooped up here waiting for death - naturally his mind goes back to the things he believed when he was an ignorant lad in some mountain village .
the general threatened me .
thea , what 's wrong ?
you see ? thea believes it , too !
please.. you should n't laugh --
do n't let it trouble you . he 's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him . he wo n't harm you .
sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way , i 'm afraid of him .
what 's bothering you , thea ? is it the general ?
everything 's so simple . i like you .
i do n't know . everything 's so mixed up --
you 're crying . why ?
so i suppose i should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me .
mr. potter , what makes you such a hard-skulled character ? you have no family no children . you ca n't begin to spend all the money you 've got .
well , all right . . .
are you running a business or a charity ward ?
but they 're somebody 's children .
i ca n't do that . these families have children .
then foreclose !
times are bad , mr. potter . a lot of these people are out of work .
all i 'm asking is thirty days more . . .
well , you 're begging , and that 's a whole lot worse .
i 'm not crying , mr. potter .
i 'm hurrying .
hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up .
all right all right .
get that ladder up here .
the groom , idiot . come on , get that ladder .
who ?
come on , we got to get this up . he 's coming .
sure i have , but i got rid of it .
how would you like to get a ticket next week ? have n't you any romance in you ?
hey , this is the company 's posters , and the company wo n't like this .
what did . . .
know you ? are you kiddin ' ? i 've been looking all over town trying to find you . i saw your car piled into that tree down there , and i thought maybe . . . hey , your mouth 's bleeding ; are you sure you 're all right ?
do n't . . . george ?
what the sam hill you yelling for , george ?
i hate to do this , fella .
bert , now listen to me . ernie , will you take me over to my mother 's house ? bert , listen ! it 's that fellow there he says he 's an angel he 's tried to hypnotize me .
bert , what 's happened to this house ? where 's mary ? where 's my kids ?
stand back .
bert ! thank heaven you 're here !
all right , put up your hands . no fast moves . come on out here , both of you .
ernie , i 'm a rich tourist today . how about driving me home in style ?
george . . .
well . . . . . . now , come right in here , mr. carter .
yeah , very funny .
good year ? well , between you and me , mr. carter , we 're broke .
well , i guess they do those things . well , i trust you had a good year .
we 're all excited around here . my brother just got the congressional medal of honor . the president just decorated him .
merry christmas .
mr. carter , merry christmas .
carter bank examiner .
good morning , sir .
where is she ?
she 's . . .
i 'm not supposed to tell .
if you know where she is , tell me where my wife is .
i . . .
i do n't know how you know these things , but tell me where is she ?
oh , well , i ca n't . . .
where 's mary ?
yes , george ?
clarence . . .
oh , i 'm not sure of anything anymore . all i know is this should be bailey park . but where are the houses ?
are you sure this is bailey park ?
sure i know where he lives . he lives in bailey park .
you know where he lives ?
zuzu 's petals .
what ?
there is no george bailey . you have no papers , no cards , no driver 's license , no 4-f card , no insurance policy . . .
what do you mean , no identity ? my name 's george bailey .
you 're nobody . you have no identity .
then if i was n't born , who am i ?
do n't you understand , george ? it 's because you were not born .
well then , why am i seeing all these strange things ?
no , of course not .
yeah , yeah , i know . you told me that . what else are you ? what . . . are you a hypnotist ?
what do you mean , i was n't there ? i remember distinctly . . .
you see , george , you were not there to stop gower from putting that poison into the . . .
why ? do n't they believe in angels ?
look , i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here .
every time you hear a bell ring , it means that some angel 's just got his wings .
made what ?
oh-oh . somebody 's just made it .
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings .
no wonder you jumped in the river .
no .
you do n't huh ? well , you got any money ?
no .
oh , yeah . hey , little fellow you worry me . you got someplace to sleep ?
you 'll see a lot of strange things from now on .
what 's the matter with him . i never saw nick act like that before .
well , maybe i left the car up at martini 's . well , come on , gabriel .
it is n't me !
oh , i do n't know . either i 'm off my nut , or he is . . . . . . or you are !
well , i had a car , and it was right here . i guess somebody moved it .
you have no car .
you have n't got your wings . yeah , that 's right .
i ca n't fly . i have n't got any wings .
our clothes are dry .
it 's stopped snowing out , has n't it ? what 's happened here ? come on , soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
your lip 's stopped bleeding , too , george .
well , that 's the doggonedest thing . . . i have n't heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid . must have been that jump in the cold water .
you 've never been born . you do n't exist . you have n't a care in the world .
what did you say ?
oh , you must n't say things like that . you . . . . . . wait a minute . wait a minute . that 's an idea . what do you think ? yeah , that 'll do it . all right . you 've got your wish . you 've never been born .
i said i wish i 'd never been born .
what 'd you say ?
now look , you must n't talk like that . i wo n't get my wings with that attitude . you just do n't know all that you 've done . if it had n't been for you . . .
i found it out a little late . i 'm worth more dead than alive .
oh , tut , tut , tut .
oh , that 's right , i keep forgetting . comes in pretty handy down here , bub .
oh , no , no . we do n't use money in heaven .
only one way you can help me . you do n't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you ?
by letting me help you .
oh , i 've got to earn them , and you 'll help me , wo n't you ?
i do n't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings .
i have n't won my wings yet . that 's why i 'm an angel second class .
well , you look about like the kind of an angel i 'd get . sort of a fallen angel , are n't you ? what happened to your wings ?
i told you i 'm your guardian angel . i know everything about you .
ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money . eight thousand dollars .
i would n't be a bit surprised .
that 's what i was sent down for . i 'm your guardian angel .
angel , second class .
odbody . . . a-s-2 . what 's that a-s-2 ?
clarence odbody , a-s-2 .
well , who are you , then ?
oh , no .
what are you , a mind reader or something ?
oh , i know all about you . i 've watched you grow up from a little boy .
suicide .
go through with what ?
well , i did , did n't i ? you did n't go through with it , did you ?
you what ? to save me ?
yes , but george . . .
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers .
no !
now , you 've probably already guessed that george never leaves bedford falls .
yes , but what happened to george ?
that 's right . not only that , but he gave his school money to his brother harry , and sent him to college . harry became a football star made second team all american .
i know . i know . he did n't go .
well , wait and see .
did he ever marry the girl ? did he ever go exploring ?
not a soul .
it 's a good face . i like it . i like george bailey . tell me , did he ever tell anyone about the pills ?
that 's the kid .
oh , you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist .
george bailey .
who is it ?
i want you to take a good look at that face .
what did you stop it for ?
that 's him when he was twelve , back in 1919. something happens here you 'll have to remember later on .
a boy ?
that 's your problem , george bailey .
hey , who 's that ?
oh , wonderful !
if you ever get your wings , you 'll see all by yourself .
why , yes . this is amazing .
oh , i forgot . you have n't got your wings yet . now look , i 'll help you out . concentrate . begin to see something ?
where ? i do n't see a thing .
well , keep your eyes open . see the town ?
well , naturally . of course .
if you 're going to help a man , you want to know something about him , do n't you ?
sit down ? what are . . .
poor george . . . sit down .
oh , thank you , sir . thank you .
clarence , you do a good job with george bailey , and you 'll get your wings .
the adventures of tom sawyer .
what 's that book you 've got there ?
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission i mean might i perhaps win my wings ? i 've been waiting for over two hundred years now , sir and people are beginning to talk .
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey .
oh , dear , dear ! his life ! then i 've only got an hour to dress . what are they wearing now ?

oh , no ! but , uncle billy . . .
that 's the best part of it . they 've appointed george here as executive secretary to take his father 's place .
what 's that ?
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .
thank you very much .

joseph , now show him what happened today .
on v-j day he wept and prayed again .

oh clarence . has n't got his wings yet , has he ? we 've passed him up right along .
that 's why i came to see you , sir . it 's that clock-maker 's turn again .

pop , do you want a shock ? i think you 're a great guy .
this town is no place for any man unless he 's willing to crawl to potter . you 've got talent , son . you get yourself an education . then get out of here .
you see what i mean , do n't you , pop ?
yes . . . yes . . . you 're right , son .
oh , now , pop , i could n't . i could n't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office .
i know it 's soon to talk about it .
no , i 'll settle for half that in cash .
still after that first million before you 're thirty .
oh , well , you know what i 've always talked about build things . . . design new buildings plan modern cities all that stuff i was talking about .
i say , maybe you were born older . i suppose you 've decided what you 're going to do when you get out of college .
how 's that ?
maybe you were born older , george .
well , no younger than i was .
he 's pretty young for that job .
we have that all figured out . you see , harry 'll take my job at the building and loan , work there four years , then he 'll go .
pretty much . you know , george , wish we could send harry to college with you . your mother and i talked it over half the night .
father , did i act like that when i graduated from high school ?
oh , he 's a sick man . frustrated and sick . sick in his mind , sick in his soul , if he has one . hates everybody that has anything that he ca n't have . hates us mostly , i guess .
i wonder what 's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway ?
i thought when we put him on the board of directors , he 'd ease up on us a little bit .
oh . . .
oh , i had another tussle with potter today .
i 'm going to miss you , too , pop . what 's the matter ? you look tired .
hope you have a good trip , george . uncle billy and i are going to miss you .

here , now , you 're broke , are n't you ?
no , george , do n't . . .
why , of course you can . come on in the office here .
george , can i see you for a second ?
then we can go up to the falls . it 's beautiful up there in the moonlight , and there 's a green pool up there , and we can swim in it . then we can climb mt . bedford , and smell the pines , and watch the sunrise against the peaks , and . . . we 'll stay up there the whole night , and everybody 'll be talking and there 'll be a terrific scandal . . .
huh ?
let 's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass .
oh , i 'll probably end up down at the library .
where are you going ?
nothing .

now look , did you buy anything ?
we 'll save them for seed . a toast !

the whole town 's gone crazy .
and then i got scared , george , and closed the doors . i . . . i . . . i . . .
holy mackerel !
every cent of it , and it still was less than we owe .
all of it ?
about an hour ago . i had to hand over all our cash .

how does anything like this ever start ? all i know is the bank called our loan .
all right now , what happened ? how did it start ?
i just did , but they said you left . this is a pickle , george , this is a pickle .
why did n't you call me ?
george . . .

some other time , george .
got to see pop , uncle billy .
avast , there , captain cook ! where you headin ' ?
five hundred dollars .
yes . . . how much is your equity in it ?
i see . i 've suddenly become quite important . what kind of security would i have , george ? have you got any stocks ?
they do n't have that kind of money , mr. potter . you know that . you 're the only one in town that can help me .
well , what about all your other friends ?
i ca n't get hold of him . he 's in europe .
not that it makes any difference to me , but why did you come to me ? why do n't you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money ?
what is it a woman , then ? you know , it 's all over town that you 've been giving money to violet bick .
no , sir . no , sir . i have n't .
no , sir . i did n't want the publicity . harry 's homecoming tomorrow . . .
have you notified the police ?
yes , sir .
all right , sir .
in the meantime , i 'll draw up the papers .
i 'd like to do that .
sure , sure , sure . you go on home and talk about it to your wife .
well , mr. potter , i . . . i . . . i know i ought to jump at the chance , but i . . . i just . . . i wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over ?
oh , confound it , man , are you afraid of success ? i 'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year , starting today . is it a deal or is n't it ?
well , what about the building and loan ?
oh , yes , george bailey . whose ship has just come in providing he has brains enough to climb aboard .
would i ? you 're not talking to somebody else around here , are you ? you know , this is me , you remember me ? george bailey .
you would n't mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , a couple of business trips to new york a year , maybe once in a while europe . you would n't mind that , would you , george ?
the envious ones say that , george , the suckers . now , i have stated my side very frankly . now , let 's look at your side . young man , twenty-seven , twenty-eight . . . married , making , say . . . forty a week .
yes . well , most people say you stole all the rest .
you like it ? i 'll send you a box .
thank you , sir . quite a cigar , mr. potter .
i know very well what you 're talking about . you 're talking about something you ca n't get your fingers on , and it 's galling you . that 's what you 're talking about , i know . well , i 've said too much . i . . . you 're the board here . you do what you want with this thing . just one thing more , though . this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter . come on , uncle billy !
i 'm not interested in your book . i 'm talking about the building and loan .
just a minute just a minute . now , hold on , mr. potter . you 're right when you say my father was no business man . i know that . why he ever started this cheap , penny-ante building and loan , i 'll never know . but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character , because his whole life was . . . why , in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing , he never once thought of himself . is n't that right , uncle billy ? he did n't save enough money to send harry to school , let alone me . but he did help a few people get out of your slums , mr. potter . and what 's wrong with that ? why . . . here , you 're all businessmen here . does n't it make them better citizens ? does n't it make them better customers ? you . . . you said . . . what 'd you say just a minute ago ? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home . wait ! wait for what ? until their children grow up and leave them ? until they 're so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars ? just remember this , mr. potter , that this rabble you 're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community . well , is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath ? anyway , my father did n't think so . people were human beings to him , but to you , a warped , frustrated old man , they 're cattle . well , in my book he died a much richer man than you 'll ever be !
you see , if you shoot pool with some employee here , you can come and borrow money . what does that get us ? a discontented , lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class . and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas . now , i say . . .
yes , sir .
they 're not my children .
pop !
have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages ?
pop !
well , now listen . i want you to put every cent you 've got into our stock , you hear ? and george , i may have a job for you ; that is , unless you 're still married to that broken-down building and loan . this is the biggest thing since radio , and i 'm letting you in on the ground floor . oh , mary . . . mary . . .
money ? yeah . . . well , a little .
that so ? well , i 'll tell him . hey , that sounds great ! oh , baby , i knew you 'd come through . now , here 's the point . mary , mary , you 're in on this too . now listen . have you got any money ?
oh , i do n't know . . . why not right here ? you remember that old tool and machinery works ? you tell your father he can get that for a song . and all the labor he wants , too . half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down .
well , why not ? can you think of anything better ?
rochester ? well , why rochester ?
well , dad 's snapped up the idea . he 's going to build a factory outside of rochester . how do you like that ?
huh ? yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans . yeah .
i have a big deal coming up that 's going to make us all rich . george , you remember that night in martini 's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans ?
you have no idea what happened . . .
you have no idea what 's happened to me .
oh , george , george !
mary ! let me touch you ! oh , you 're real !
oh , george , george , george .
george , darling ! where have you been ?
mary ! mary !
going up to see zuzu .
where 're you going ?
just a teensie one ninety-nine , six . she 'll be all right .
is she running a temperature ? what is it ?
yes , i called him right away . he says it 's nothing to worry about .
the doctor ? was the doctor here ?
just a cold . the doctor says it 's nothing serious .
what is it , a sore throat or what ?
oh , she 's got a cold . she 's in bed . caught it coming home from school . they gave her a flower for a prize and she did n't want to crush it so she did n't button up her coat .
zuzu ! what 's the matter with zuzu ?
left them at the office .
where 's your coat and hat ?
yeah , just started .

lassos the stork ! you mean you . . . what is it , a boy or a girl ?
george bailey lassos stork .

i did n't want to marry anybody else in town . i want my baby to look like you .
you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town .
to keep from being an old maid .
mary hatch , why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me ?
hi .
hi .

just a minute , dear . oh-oh . . .
that does it come here .
after that , who cares ?
you know what we 're going to do ? we 're going to shoot the works . a whole week in new york . a whole week in bermuda . the highest hotels the oldest champagne the richest caviar the hottest music , and the prettiest wife !
i feel like a bootlegger 's wife . look !

mary . . .
george . . . george . . . george . . .
no , marriage is all right for harry , and marty , and sam and you .
oh , it 's just marriage in general you 're not enthusiastic about , huh ?
well , of course i like her . she 's a peach .
do n't you like her ?
oh . . . yeah , yeah . that 's all right .
thank you .
well , i see it still smells like pine needles in here .
well , then , sit down .
no , i do n't want to be rude .
would you rather leave ?
all right , for a minute . i still ca n't understand it though . you know i did n't tell anybody i was coming here .
oh , i worked there for a couple of vacations , but i do n't know . . . i guess i was homesick .
it 's all right . i thought you 'd go back to new york like sam and ingie , and the rest of them .
do you like it ?
where 'd you get that dress ?
tuesday .
when did you get back ?
well , i 'll come in for a minute , but i did n't tell anybody i was coming over here .
well , are you coming in or are n't you ?
i did n't tell anybody . i just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
did n't you tell her ?
my mother just called you ? well , how did she know ?
about coming in . your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit .
about what ?
have you made up your mind ?
how 's that ?
yeah , so i noticed . have you made up your mind ?
hello , mary . i just happened to be passing by .
i 'm going to scream !
they 're way downtown . they 'd be on my side , too .
gesundheit . this requires a little thought here .
ouch !
well , then you could swallow it and it 'd all dissolve , see ? and the moonbeams 'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes , and the ends of your hair . am i talking too much ?
i 'll take it . and then what ?
what is it you want , mary ? what do you want ? you want the moon ? just say . . .
if i told you it might not come true .
come on , tell me .
oh , no .
well , not just one wish . a whole hatful , mary . i know what i 'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that . i 'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and i 'm going to see the world . italy , greece , the parthenon , the colosseum . then i 'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then i 'm going to build things . i 'm gon na build air fields . i 'm gon na build skyscrapers a hundred stories high . i 'm gon na build bridges a mile long . . .
what 'd you wish , george ?
i would n't live in it as a ghost . now watch . . . right on the second floor there .
uh-huh .
in that place ?
oh , no , george , do n't . it 's full of romance , that old place . i 'd like to live in it .
oh , no , do n't . i love that old house .
okay , then , i 'll throw a rock at the old granville house .
ummmmm . . .
you may kiss my hand .
your . . . your caboose , my lady .
oh , no . just right . your age fits you . yes , sir , you look a little older without your clothes on .
too young or too old ?
eighteen ? why , it was only last year you were seventeen .
eighteen .
i do n't know . maybe i will say it . how old are you anyway ?
well , why do n't you say it ?
i guess i 'm not quite the football type . you . . . look wonderful . you know , if it was n't me talking i 'd say you were the prettiest girl in town .
do i look as funny as you do ?
beautiful .
hot dog ! just like an organ .
okay what can we lose ?
neither am i .
i 'm not very good at this .
uh-uh . that was a little girl named mary hatch . that was n't you .
uh-huh .
me ?
you 've passed me on the street almost every day .
well , i do n't .
hello . you look at me as if you did n't know me .
well , hello .
of course you never . only us explorers can get it . i 've been nominated for membership in the national geographic society .
a new magazine ! i never saw it before .
you do n't like coconuts ! say , brainless , do n't you know where coconuts come from ? lookit here from tahiti fiji islands , the coral sea !
i do n't like coconuts .
with coconuts ?
i 'll take chocolate .
made up your mind yet ?
okay , mom . you coming later ? you coming later , george ?
put those things in the car and i 'll get your tie and studs together .
oh , no you do n't . harry , now , not my best haviland .
oh , mom i 'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen .

well , are n't you going to make a deposit ?

you forgot something .
huh ?
i guess you forgot something .
i 'm supposed to .
sure you do -- you win either way .
but of course .
i ca n't wait to get there .
soon , dark eyes , soon .
when do we get to the lighthouse ?
so 's mine .
my hair 's getting wet !
i want to go faster !
how fast is enough ?
wheee ! faster !
with butter , if they got any ... .
great ! find one for me .
what the hell . for you ... .
for me ... ?
well , i do n't know ... .
come on , you guys .
you going to the lighthouse ?
you can ?
what ?
with the right wind , 15-20 knots .
how fast does this go ?
swim for it !
get on the rocks !
back down !
easy , easy -- you 'll swamp us !
stop paddling !
do n't !
i think we 're changing course a little .
bring her to port a little . that 's it -- steady .
sean ! listen ! listen to me , sean .
it 's okay , it 's okay ... .
i ca n't help it it sticks in my mind .
what 'd you do ? memorize the tide tables ?
low tide at cable junction is 7:46 p.m .
no problem , no problem .
someone pop your balloon ?
oh , shit .
i was counting on hours .
putz -- that wo n't be for hours .
it 's not going to be easy .
we better go back in .
your dad must be really pissed .
yee-hah !
turkeys ! eat wind !
okay , okay , do n't say i did n't remind you .
shut up .
i could give you a dozen good reasons .
why not ?
then why are we futzing around the dock ? we can make a few bucks working at the beach .
yeah .
if you 're beached , why are we doing this ? for practice ?
they 're moving pretty fast .
maybe by now they are .
i hope that 's the cousin .
who 's that ? quick -- i 'm in love .
good . it 's terrible .
no .
is she responsible for the punch ?
yeah , it 's her job .
we 're hung up on something .
what is it ?
too hot in the lighthouse ?
why 'd they decide to move ?
no big thing , we 'll see who 's out there , maybe picnic .
the lighthouse ?
lucky . lucky , lucky , lucky .
over here . i want you to meet somebody .
mostly old garbage . today we found a '48 hudson .
shells and lobsters and stuff ?
same as always -- glub-glub , bubble-bubble , stroke-stroke . there sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean .
what the hell . did your mom put all this together ?
that 's awful .
they 're okay , if they got little white canes and tin cups .
the shark .
but the island !
shit . shit , shit , shit !
but we had it ! we were headed right for it !
we 're throwing a rope and you better catch it , hear ?
listen to andy , sean .
goddamn it , sean , you listen to me or i will kick your ass , do you hear me ?
oh , out a ways . maybe the lighthouse .
where 're we going ?
what the hell , we 're steering for it .
i do n't know .
sean ! catch it !
throw it .
there 's a shark ... .
as soon as you get us on the island , you got to call in . my dad 's the mayor ... .
you 're betting what you already got .
loser sails home alone .
like hell ! we 're on the starboard tack !
coming up ! give way !
we 'll take your supercargo .
we 're carrying weight .
can you get us a line ?
we 're hung up here . snagged .
the rope ! the rope !
sean ! catch the rope !
over here !
hey !
anyone got another set of sails ?
how 're we going to do that floating on this garbage ... ?
you bet . hang on ... .
you coming up on him ?

let 's just go sailing , okay ?
i thought you said she was going with us ?
gangway , turkies !
coming up !
i need a hand here ... .
it 's still there !
what is it ? what 's there ?
no ! it 's still there !
it 's okay , it 's okay . what 's the matter ? tina ? honey ? hey -- -
n-o-o-o-o-o-o ... .
tina !
oh , yeah . sure .
chief brody -- can we go ? please ?
got it .
see where cable junction is ? look to the left . the lighthouse . that 's it .
never mind that shit . just point .
about 10 degrees off your star- board bow , take a heading leeward of sand island , and lay her north by northeast ... .
hey -- you ca n't do that .
i 'm going out there .
goddamnit , hendricks , untie the rope there .
you 're too close . back off .
please . it 's my job .
untie that rope .
but i signed for the boat . you ' re not authorized any more .
mike 's out there .
you ca n't stop me .
i ca n't let you take her out .
about an hour , maybe two . let 's see -- i came on about eight ... .
how long ago ?
right .
oh yeah -- i 'm expecting a long distance call , very important . give them my home phone .
shit -- i 'm late for dinner ... close up , okay ?
nine-thirty , ten maybe .
the drugstore 's closed ? what the hell time is it ?
of course not , they 're closed . phil fogarty 's place . he 'll do it for me .
not the drugstore !
i know just where to go .
you got it .
if there is , develop it !
well , what the hell -- might be something worth seeing . take it somewhere and see if there 's film in it ... .
that one -- from the wreck . you brought it up , did you look inside it ?
what camera ?
what about that camera ?
oh .
the woman passenger on the boat that blew up .
positive i.d . ?
you did n't miss much . christ , what a mess .
i missed you at the funeral home . santos said you were here .
in here .
chief ?
could you just keep that crowd back , please ?
we got a helluva tide this month .
if you had a $ 100,000 boat there 'd be an investigation .
if i had a $ 100,000 boat , i sure as hell would n't leave it anchored alone in the channel .
rich people . home port is newport , rhode island .
abandoned ? it 's a little early in the season for that .
diver 's camera . tom andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser .
i just made it up . it means , `` get me out of there . '' what the hell 's that ?
i never heard of a 908 .
hendricks . i want to go over your reports and your form 908 .
chief ... .
then check it out . i 'll be in the office .
happy to do it .
on your own time ?
till noon . this is on my own time . hi , shorty .
are n't you off-duty ?
good morning !
stay here . do n't go anywhere . just stay here .
dad , i 'm sorry ... .
what ?
sean 's still out there .
jesus , do n't freeze on me . what about the others ?
at least you 're safe . what about the others ?
i passed out , but i 'm okay .
it 's okay . what happened ?
pop . i 'm sorry .
mike ? is that you ?
no backtalk ! i spoke to upton , at the beach , and he 's got a job for you there . you can work until school starts .
hey , come on ... .
sailing ? forget it . you 're beached . grounded . no more boats .
i kind of had plans ... .
i got something for you to do tomorrow .
you want to come here a minute ?
yeah ?
michael .
not till next year .
is hooper coming to dinner ?
you stay right here . you 're going in with me .
pop ... .
you heard me .
oh , c'mon .
you stay here a minute .
okay , okay .
do n't go out if it 's rough or any- thing , huh ? we 've had a lot of trouble .
i 'll be careful . i 'll see y'later .
look , humor the old man -- just be careful .
because .
okay , not bartending . why on the water every day ?
bartending ? i 'm 17 .
what about tennis ? riding ? fixing up old cars ? bartending ?
i 'm going .
you 'll have to make up your own mind about that .
do i have to ?
you could work out at the beach , make a few bucks for school .
what else is there to do ?
every day ?
i do n't know about him -- i 'm going down to the dock , maybe go sailing .
sailing ?
no place special . just hanging out .
where to ?
okay , okay -- stand over there ... .
come on , phil , do n't jerk me around .
let 's see -- you got a minute ?
what else you got ?
not bad -- that 's a real fast lens , probably 1.4. look at the diffusion , though ... .
well , yeah , i did , that 's the funny thing . you ca n't tell much from the negatives , i was going to blow 'em up . here 's a test i did ... .
did you get any pictures ?
sure , sure -- jeff hendricks brought in this camera , see , from underwater , and i did n't know how to get it open , but my brother-in- law , in montauk , he works at a hi- fi store , and they sell cameras , so he ... .
you said something about a camera .
i do n't know what you did , but that kid stopped . i have n't heard one peep , not one 'breaker breaker ' for days . believe me , it 's a pleasure ... .
it means i do n't like all that grab-ass and heavy breathing with my wife , it means i know who 's out to screw me here , and it means that i know something none of you know because i 've been there -- and i do n't want to go through that horror again . ever !
what 's that supposed to mean ?
maybe i do n't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here , but i do n't work the same way .
you do n't make enough .
is that what it is ? dollars ? money ? i 'll pay for it . take it out of my salary .
will you listen to this man ? will you just listen to him ? you really caused a panic on a public beach , you shoot up the place , god knows who could 've been injured -- what if somebody de- cides to sue us ? that could ruin us .
there is nothing to discuss .
my ass !
what have you seen before ? this is nothing . seaweed . mud . some- thing in the lens .
you 're damn right that 's what it is .
is that what it is ?
what are you all , blind ? it 's a shark . look -- teeth , jaw , gills .
look -- i just got this from phil fogarty . it was in the camera belonging to the missing divers . it proves i was right , all along .
it came up during the meeting .
temporarily ? uh ... sure ... .
is jeff hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim chief of police in your absence ?
heck of a way to treat a taxpayer . do n't you have any pull with the chief , here ?
too late , it 's written .
wait a minute ... .
sorry , i 'm all booked up ... come , m'dear .
may i have this dance ?
all of us thank you , okay ?
y'know , brody -- for the first time in years it 's worth putting money into this town .
me neither .
fantastic lady . do n't know what i 'd do without her .
do n't be ridiculous -- sharks do n't take things personally .
look -- can great white sharks communicate ? send out signals , or something ? you know , take revenge , sense an enemy ... .
not when it 's like this . this animal has been ashore for 10 , 12 hours , and drifting for a day , at least . every little nibbler in the sea 's taken a bite .
ca n't you tell ?
it 's either a great white , or another killer whale .
not necessarily . these wounds could 've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea , or more . none of them are immediately fatal . currents could 've carried the body 10 miles further .
so there 's one around here .
sound . like sonar , or radar . they home in on irregular sounds , unusual sounds , any rhythmic low- frequency vibration .
sound ?
and sound .
that 's it ? probably ? look , sharks are attracted by blood , and thrashing around ... .
probably .
jesus , do n't quibble with me . i want to know if a great white shark did this .
this is a mammal , not a fish .
because this big fish has been bitten by some other big fish ... .
what makes you think there might be ?
is there one in these waters ?
okay , so that 's it .
that 's it .
carcharadon carcharias .
i know that this was probably a great white shark . car-cadon ... caradan ... .
do you ?
look , i know a little bit about sharks .
could be a shark . but maybe not .
you do n't tell me my job , and i wo n't tell you about yours , okay ?
but that 's what we 're here to find out , right ?
we do n't know that , do we ?
the shark that did this . it was a shark , was n't it ?
what shark ?
the shark 's mouth .
the whale 's mouth ?
bite radius . you know , the size of the mouth ?
the what ?
come on , let 's check the bite radius .
length , 22 feet , 8 inches .
first things first .
look at that :
after we 've looked , we 'll talk .
as soon as i heard about it , i called you . this thing is big ! his arms indicate big .
mike 's out there .
what is it ? what 's the matter ?
going out .
what 're you doing ?
just one minute ... .
hey -- it 's not your job any more . i 'm going to be late for work .
do n't rush into it -- we may need the income .
i 'll give notice .
turn in the car . clean my desk , explain things to our sons , then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss .
what 're you going to do today ?
i try . goddamnit , i tried ... now , i 'm tired ... i ca n't keep fighting it ... i 'm too tired ... i 'm ... i 'm ... .
i know you did ... .
fired me ! i 'm not a hysterical man . i 'm responsible . i know what i saw ... .
they have no right to treat you like that . you 've given them every- thing . for four years , you 've protected this town , the people on this island ... .
... everybody wants the job . no one wants the authority . except hendricks . fine . he can go out there in that precious boat , and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me . call me in new york ... tell him to kiss my ass ... .
honey , this is nothing ... i do n't know what it is . what did they ... .
showed them the photo , showed them the goddamn shark , big as life . they did n't see it . not like me . not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture ... he 's out there , somewhere ... i shot off my gun , shot off my big mouth , so they fired me ... .
stop that ! we 're not going any place . you love it here . tell me what the hell happened !
no sweat . a blessing in disguise . back to the city , you can go to bloomingdale 's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat ... we 're surrounded by water here , you realize that ? me , surrounded by water ... ridiculous .
because of today ? the beach ?
then that 's what i meant . fired . canned . out on my fanny . the selectmen just made hendricks the new chief of police . just like that .
that you were fired .
what 'd i say ?
what ?
ooohh , nothing . i just got fired , that 's all .
what 's wrong ?
that 's great too . gorgeous .
sean 's asleep .
that 's great .
hi . i closed a sale today , without len . that 's $ 1200 commission , if the papers go through .
yeah . i think so . mike ! keep it down , for chrissake !
are you going to be able to sleep ?
the goddamn smell is always the same .
it was bad , was n't it .
in the city , it happened all the time -- some kid o.d . 's on a rooftop , top , a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local , old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies . call the cops . what are we , immune ?
do you ?
i know what you 're going to say .
he wanted a job , he 's got one . i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night .
all summer ?
terrific .
no .
oh . want to talk about it ?
found one of the missing victims from that boat deal .
use the little brush there . why were you at santos ' ?
that 's what i said . is there any of that hand cleaner stuff ?
nothing , huh ?
nothing .
careful . what 's wrong ?
oww !
santos ' place .
oh , perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair . where were you ?
oh , hi -- how was dinner ?
damn .
sort of -- mathew hooper is aboard the research vessel aurora , presently in the antarctic ocean , and wo n't be in radio range until half-past next spring .
for me ?
thank you . i 'll tell him .
it 's an island . got to run .
boat nut . what is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating ?
one what ? ah-ha !
because , i 'm in the middle of a boating accident , i got only four regular cops and one secretary , and a chief deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat he 's another one .
why do n't you take a half day and clean this junk up ?
in the den .
where 's my day book ?
what 're you guys doing today ?
eat cheerios .
so 's a donut .
it 's good with coffee .
you have to smoke so early in the morning ?
better yet .
hey ! that 's my boss !

sean 's awake .
mmmmmmorning ... .
mmmm .
home it is .
let 's get the kid home .
right .
fooling around ?
listen -- what are you doing later ?
i did , i did .
and how . i thought you would n't respect me .
remember 1959 , the jersey shore ?
because they 're playing our song .
why ?
can you take a little time out from your busy schedule to dance with the old man ?
my boss and your boss . sure .
do i have to talk to those two ?
i can see that . do n't you know this is a big deal ?
late .
where the hell were you ?
go ahead , whatever it 's worth .
martin , could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up our minds about something ?
what the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls ? jesus , it 's right there in front of you . i know what a goddamn shark looks like , i 've been through it , do n't you understand ? i 've seen this sonofabitch before !
martin , it could be anything .
what ?
chief -- the board of selectmen has a question only you can answer .
perfect . look at this -- -
martin , this is kind of an official meeting
thank god you guys were all together . i got something for you . proof !
do n't push it this time . if you do , it wo n't turn out the way you want , i guarantee you that .
someone has to do something .
what am i , an ass ? when you called me , i called elkins , and her bosses . nothing she saw is proof of anything .
bullshit ? i 'll give you bullshit -- there 's a dead whale out there with bites all over it !
bullshit .
maybe they are !
there 's always deaths in these waters that never turn up . are they all shark victims ?
two of them are still missing !
a tragedy . but that was a boating accident ; no bites , no sharks , nothing but a boating accident .
please , larry -- there 's good reason . those water skiers ... .
martin , when we build up our tax base a little , you can have every- thing you want ; right now , the town 's broke .
it 's still a good idea .
and i stood by while you told the people from ramada and marriott that if they put up a hotel they 'd need $ 800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches ! in new england ? we all lost on that one .
i know , i know ... .
we have done something -- hell , we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it 's the only one in 2000 miles , y'know .
we have to do something .
of course i can , but ca n't it wait ? these things cost money , and this town does n't have much money .
i got a feeling . i have to act on it -- you can understand that , ca n't you ?
no one has seen a shark -- no fin , no bites , nothing . be realistic .
of course . look -- i 've got some missing persons , fatalities , evidence of a large predator ... .
are you serious ?
larry , i do n't know how to say this , but i think we got a shark problem . a real one .
we 're alone .
we have got to talk , and we have got to talk alone .
i 'm showing summer rentals . we got a helluva season going .
thank you , thank you . you know my son , do n't you ?
very impressive ceremony . good speech .
hello , hello . it went well , i thought .
1530 hours . might still be there . base out .
when ?
that 's what he said .
did you say cable junction ?
then nothing . if you see him , tell him to switch to an operational frequency , or give me a status report yourself .
yeah ? then what ?
last transmission said ten juve- niles .
did he raise the kids ?
that 's what i 'd like to know . lost transmission at cable junction .
where the hell is air one ?
brody ? this is patrol base .
harbor air , do you read ? over ?
affirmative , affirmative . turn the kids day-sailing back to port . i heard you . patrol out .
if they 're not at the light , look for them . i do n't want them out there . get them back to port !
10-4 , soon as i can raise him .
that 's it . just do it , all right ?
that 's it ?
there 's a bunch of kids day-sailing that way . turn them back to port .
what for ?
get him the hell over to amity point , the old lighthouse . right now .
10-4 , in a few minutes . he 's down checking a buoy in the bay channel .
affirmative . can you get your chopper airborne ?
sure they did ... .
they made me go with them .
i 'm okay , baby , i 'm here . it 's okay ... .
dad ! dad !
hang on !
hiya yourself .
hi dad .
you stay with mrs. silvera , tootsie . okay ?
can i go with you today ?
what 's daddy doing ?
some people .
no . find your brother , okay ?
can i go swimming ?
should n't he be at home ?
mom , michael wo n't talk to me .
it 's all right , we 're okay .
we 're going to die .
shh . shhh ... .
it killed her . it ate her .
tide does n't turn for three hours .
what 's wrong ?
oh , yeah . so why are n't they doing it now ?
i told you , remember ?
you going to fool around with mike ? well , i 'm not doing anything with him .
now i really want to see it .
the lighthouse is a make-out spot .
i 've never been supercargo .
that 's you .
is that me ?
maybe .
mike ! are you going out ?
great .
she just likes to tease . i think she really likes you .
i will , i will .
i want you to meet my cousin .
waiting for andy .
you 're not going out right away , are you ?
great .
my cousin will be here tomorrow .
i 'm not crazy about blind dates .
seventeen . she 's a senior .
how old is your cousin ?
okay , okay , coming ... .
help ! help !
terry ! you okay ?
hang on , hang on ... okay , go .
ready ?
whoops , almost lost one . ca n't play with the dolphins without skis ... .
great !
sure . they like to play . we may see some today .
did you ever see a dolphin ?
gaff rigged ? why not a staysail schooner ? go anywhere . look at this -- the mayan , an alden schooner .
that 's what i want -- a gaff rig .
none at all . i wonder what the brebner twins are doing tomorrow night .
no class .
i know .
that 's a crock of shit .
does n't hurt to ask . sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest .
you 're crazy . she 's ed 's girl friend .
tina wilcox .
who 'd you ask ?
me neither .
nope .
get a dance yet ?
sideways - for every yard we go this way , we also slide sideways this way ... .
what 's that mean ?
the wind drift is lateral .
i ca n't stop thinking !
shut up .
by 7:46 , when the tide turns around , we 'll be twenty miles out . more , with this wind .
they tend to follow moving things . maybe it 's following polo and timmy .
maybe it 's gone .
3:30 .
anyone know what time it is ?
you got it .
that you 'll put down a blanket . i 've got black and blue marks all over my butt , and my mom 's getting uptight about them .
anything . anything .
wait a minute . promise me something .
mmmmmm .
and second ?
but first , a little juice ... .
i dunno . we 'll think of something .
what 're we going to do in the mean time ?
they 'll be there when we get there . might even have a fire started .
what about the others ?
it 'll take us to budapest if you 're not careful .
the tide 's running . it 'll take us to the light .
what about sailing ?
just like this .
you want to tack , or just leave her pointed up like this ?
double nope !
give me back my hat !
nope .
come on back up here !
with you , everything 's next week . i want to go skiing soon . tomorrow ?
next week .
eddie , can we do that ? can we go skiing ? we can use my uncle 's boat . eddie ?
huh ?
take a break for a minute , okay ?
anything ?
be careful ... .
what the hell , they ca n't fire both of us -- someone 's got to be in charge , right ? which way are we going ?
hurry , please .
i 'm going .
mrs. brody , look -- if he ca n't go , then you ca n't go . neither of you can go .
yep . looked like they were headed to the lighthouse .
mike ? our mike ?
all of them . mike , junior vaughn , brookie peters , pat , lucy -- all that whole gang .
what kids ? who went out ?
right after , the kids went out ?
now you 're talking . let 's get out of here before we do find something .
untangle it and let 's go -- we do n't need a blackout on the island .
it comes here from cable junction .
oh , great .
power line .
what is it ?
what the hell is it ?
about damn time .
i do n't care about the overtime , i 'm hungry . and cold . and most of all , bored .
until we find something .
how much longer ?
happens every season -- someone takes off . once we had a schooner for a month while the owners went fox hunting .
figure they split ?
rich or poor , it 's nice to have money .
we 're fighting wind and current . i though we 'd be out longer , catch the incoming tide .
what 's wrong ?
i love it .
i do n't care .
name it .
that 's fun ! let 's race for some- thing !
i can go out if i want to .
i thought you were grounded .
good . i 'll be on the dock at eight . eight o'clock , everybody !
no .
you do everything your parents tell you ?
that 's not it . my dad told me not to go .
no way . everybody 's going sailing . if you do n't want to take me , just say so .
maybe you and brooke could come over to the town beach ... .
it 'll be fun , come on !
i 'm not sure i can .
i 'd like to go out to the light- house with you .
i 'll be right there . wait up .
we 'll be over by the lighthouse .
is there something i do n't know about ?
too hot tor those two ? i ca n't believe it .
great . i got some wine .
it 's an island , near here , with a lighthouse . we sometimes hang out there , you know ... .
what 's the lighthouse ?
sean , baby , please ... .
he 's got to help or it wo n't work .
might as well .
heading back ?
your ass i will . besides , the wind 's turning with the tide . sailing back is going to be a bitch .
uh . well . maybe you could give polo a hand going in ... .
what about me ?
if we beat them , they can both go home stag ! single-o ! alone ! jackie can come back in this boat !
mike and larry are racing ! loser goes home alone !
coming about ... .
faster ! faster !
coming about , then .
they 're turning around .
anyone want to go the lighthouse ?
who would n't .
you going with patrick ?
not tonight .
when are we going out ? you and me ?
i do n't think she 's such hot stuff .
would you take him ?
yeah .
i 'm not in the way . andy , am i in the way ?
look -- if you 're going to get in the way , you can just go home .
okay , okay . close your door .
michael ... .
quiet ! shhh !
i want to go with you !
no .
take me .
maybe .
you 're going sailing .
yeah .
you 're going out .
you eat cheerios . i want fruit loops .
eat cheerios .
i want fruit loops !
yeah . go on , beat it .
do i have to play with the little kids ?
how was dive class ?
you always go with andy .
i do n't need you . andy 's here .
forget it , he wo n't listen .
be reasonable , please ... .
look , what am i supposed to do ? it 's done , it 's over . we have to deal with the consequences .
so it ca n't be done like that . the man 's a menace , plain and simple .
so ? so ?
larry , i 'm a businessman , trying to make a buck like anybody else .
he thought he had a good reason .
you should 've been out there . you should 've seen him waving that gun , like a maniac . there were shots fired !
what the hell is he doing ?
oh , my god ... .
maybe nobody will notice . let 's get them back in the bus .
how the hell do we get him down . from there ?
wave to my son .
oh , shit .
brody 's riding his tower .
i think we got a couple of live ones .
len , can i see you a minute ?
and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities , ellen brody here will be happy to answer them .
okay ... have them get it out of the tank .
do n't feel bad .
get the hose ! we 've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him !
it has n't adjusted .
no , i 'm fine , thanks .
go on , you 're tired .
i 'm only walking him . you caught him . you have to be exhausted .
why do n't you take a rest , brian ?
i have to walk him till the drug wears off .
we 're ready for you .
and philip will be there to film it . now that 's the end of it !
no , it will be too much distraction . i do n't want that many people in the water . i 'll go in , give it a belly shot , and get out .
he 's going with you , doctor .
with those camera lights and ...
absolutely . good idea .
i can get it .
it would make a marvelous attraction ; the only great white in captivity .
no one 's ever caught a great white except indirectly in fishing nets . i want to dart it and keep it alive .
go on , doctor .
it 's easy . put a net on the derrick . put the net in the water by the intake passage . turn off the intake passage . shark comes out into the net and is hauled up .
what 's your plan , brody ?
and a missing man .
what you 're saying is we have a great white shark in the lagoon .
i know , but you 're just going to have to find another way . so you better start .
we 're going to have to cover the entire lagoon .
ca n't help you , mike . do n't have the manpower .
i 'll need more men to look .
have you checked the bars ? the guy 's irresponsible ; he 's done this before .
i do n't understand . overman 's too good a diver to disappear .
shit .
yeah . down there .
you see the three-quarter socket ?
coming with us ? overman 's buying .
sure am .
you buying ?
it 's miller time !
me ? i do n't know . twenty , thirty . i love them , think they 're the greatest .
how many sharks have you killed ?
never know down there . helps to have a friend , sometimes .
she can take care of herself . she does n't need you .
well , do n't worry about your fiancee . we 'll watch over her .
no .
are n't you suiting up , mate ?
i 'm fine .
are you okay ?
only to myself .
you do n't have to prove anything .
i want that shark , kathryn .
michael , you do n't have to go down there .
it 's a construction job . i 'm the only one that can do it .
but you --
i am . you 're not .
michael , you 're not going down there .
me .
who 's going to do it ?
that 's right .
... okay .
... i have to go , honey . phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark .
couple of fractures , lacerations . they say he 's gon na be all right .
how is he ?
you two go ! i 'll call calvin !
come on !
it 's all controlled from the control room .
somebody better get down there !
you wanted to know about a cave ?
that 's why they 're always moving . they have to have it .
what did you just say before ? about water flowing through them ?
i do n't understand .
that 's what i 've come to ask you . is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing ?
thirty feet ? ? ?
this tooth is from another shark . a shark that could be 30 feet long !
what do you mean , we do n't ?
that 's just it , michael . we do n't !
what 's the big deal ? a shark got overman , and we got the shark .
it was removed from charlie overman 's body .
so ?
it 's a shark 's tooth !
put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
i ca n't ! my dad had it , and i do n't know if you can inherit it or what , but i got it , and i hate it . i ca n't stand it !
yes , you can .
i ca n't take water , kathryn .
come on .
i have to get out of here .
michael , take deep breaths .
hydrophobia ...
honey , what is it ?
well , that 's why you got it .
i did . he wants it on exhibit .
so tell calvin .
it 's too soon to move him .
... he ought to put him in here .
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow .
michael , i do n't have time . please ! it 's time you dealt with this and got over it . now come on !
i do n't want to see them , kathryn .
they 're not going to hurt you . they 're encased in plastic .
i 'm not going to walk through that shark arcade .
michael , come on , do n't be silly . this is the quickest way . you 're not going to walk all the way around ?
no , i 'm not going through there .
yes . it 's faster .
... mean through the tubes ?
no , we 'll go through here .
sure . let 's go .
i want to make sure the white is getting enough flow . would you do that for me ?
okay .
i need more pressure in the shark tank .
what 's up ?
they said you 'd be here .
it 's my new perfume . great white , the man-eater .
you do n't .
mmmm ... you smell good .
me , too .
recovering nicely .
how 's your patient ?
finally .
sean , that 's right ...
get some sleep . and tell sean i 'm sorry .
you want me to stay ?
we 'll go to palm springs , death valley , arizona desert , anyplace where there 's no water .
sounds wonderful .
after this has opened , when everything 's settled down , you and i are going away . just the two of us . no dolphins , no sharks , no whales , no penguins . just you and me .
... me , too .
i can use a shot of what he 's got .
no , you 're not .
you amaze me . i 'm more scared than you .
no .
change your mind ?
why ? 'cause they 're hungrier ?
it 's easier to lure sharks at night .
would n't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime ?
yes ?
kathryn ...
thank you .
should protect you a little , from the compression . if that thing gets ahold of you .
fine piece of engineering .
bracelets .
what 's that ?
here .
i got it on sale . a real steel .
oh , yeah . really nice . who 's your designer ? sassoon shark ?
kathryn , you 're crazy . really crazy . a suicidal maniac .
i know i can capture it .
after what happened to us ?
yes .
you 're going down there again ?
it 's never over ... here comes another six years of bad dreams .
do n't think about it . it 's over .
god , they 're horrible . i hate them . did you see its eyes ? how black they are ? the look in them ?
how the hell did it get in here ?
it 's all right , baby . we 're safe ...
michael ...
i 'm okay .
i think so . i 'm not sure ... are you ?
you all right ?
get your reserve bottle and let 's go .
you would , would n't you ? i 'd end up whale shit , you would n't care .
no , i do n't want to leave now . i 'm having too good a time ... of course i 'm coming ! you 'd think you 're gon na leave me ?
are you coming ... ?
i 'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber .
i talked you into this ?
what mind ? if i had a mind , i 'd never have let you talk me into this .
make up your mind .
and leave me down here ? ? ?
up .
where are you going ?
okay , stay . we 'll come back for you .
yeah , and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle .
michael , the sub 's dead .
swim where ? out there ? oh , no , forget it , not me ! you go , i 'm staying .
that we swim .
you sound like houston mission control . what the hell does it mean ?
... electrical connection malfunctioning .
... if nothing 's wrong , why are we stopping here ?
nothing .
what 's wrong ?
let 's not talk about that now , okay ?
you know , on our honeymoon , we should go scuba diving .
oh , yeah . very .
it 's romantic down here .
i know , i built it . i 've just never seen it this way .
that 's a lot of ground to cover .
let 's head to the gate and work our way back .
... friggin ' fish .
they just wanted to say hello .
baby goddamn scared me to death !
hi , baby .
damn it !
yes .
are you scared ?
no .
honey ... you all right ?
just put your mask on .
that 's cute , kathryn . real cute .
take a deep breath and hold it .
what do i do now ?
i do n't have a choice .
look , michael ... you do n't have to come .
where 's the rubber band ?
we play hide and seek all the time . they find a lot of things .
they 're coming with us ?
get out of here !
not enough loving .
no , you do n't need all that starch . you 're getting too fat .
sure . want to try that new italian place ?
i ca n't leave now . we taking sean out ?
okay , forget him now . i 'm going to pick up sean . take a ride ?
he does n't need the money . he inherited a fortune . he kills for kicks . tv battles between non-predator fish and divers . the diver always wins .
it 's his work .
i do n't like what he does .
yeah , you really do n't like him .
... hutton . he really pisses me off .
and what else is bothering you ?
i do n't know . i ca n't understand it . something 's bothering them .
how come ?
everything 's going wrong . i 'm having more trouble with bobby than i ever have before . i ca n't get him to respond .
you called , doctor ?
okay , bye .
honey , i got ta go .
my imagination is n't that good .
do n't let him get you . just continue your patterns and pretend he 's not around .
that macho pompous english --
see you later .
yeah .
do n't forget you have your brother .
damn it . i ca n't understand ! i got ta go , hon .
i guess .
pre-opening jitters .
they 're acting very strange suddenly .
look , kathryn . they 're jealous .
you will . i 'll see to it .
hope i make it through both .
till this opens , not our wedding .
what is it , 97 days ?
well , not much longer to go .
want another one ?
thank you .
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage .
a piece of pie on sunday .
he . she . let 's blow the bitch up !
she , mister hutton .
we can assume he 's back in the water intake passage .
the water ski show ! we have to get them out !
he 's big as a bloody bus !
how 'd it get in here ? !
i 've heard of a white that big , in australia ...
is there such a place ? a cave or something with such a flow ?
sharks have to keep moving . they can never stop or they 'll suffocate . if water is n't always flowing through them , they 'll die .
thanks to you .
well , doctor . you 've got your shark .
brian , he 's coming around !
believe me , i am .
get ready to go .
hello . i think his nap 's over .
and here i thought i was charming you .
i think that you and i are natural enemies .
the grenade 's just to intimidate whitey . he knows i have it , so he watches out . same is true when i film lions , tigers , rhinos ...
we 're all from the sea , mr. hutton . our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans . by continuing to destroy fish , man destroys himself .
that 's because i am the shark .
before , you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade . now you 're helping to nurse it back to life .
philip .
you 're a strange man , mr. hutton .
that 's what life is , doctor . full of chances to hurt yourself , or somebody else .
somebody could have gotten hurt .
some miss all their shots .
skillful ? i missed my first shot .
you were quite daring in capturing him . very skillful indeed .
and i like you .
so do i. but for different reasons .
i like it when they wake up .
why are you ?
not at all .
thanks for helping .
could be a new dance ... walking the shark .
just watch it when he does .
should be coming out of it soon .
kiss him , maybe he 'll turn into a frog .
still sleeping .
how 's sleeping beauty ?
look , doctor , this is n't one of your pet porpoises we 're after . it 's a torpedo of muscle . murderous expertise ! i 've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves ! do n't be so concerned about them . worry about yourself .
you 're supposed to film it , not turn it to hash !
afraid i ca n't do that .
i insist you get rid of that bomb .
because i do n't trust you , that 's why .
why ?
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that !
let 's hope he knows that .
we 're taking that shark alive !
lunch for whitey . something to munch on in case things get dicey .
what in hell is that ?
shark bait . draws them over for closeups .
you look like an orange worm .
so do i , love .
i want that shark alive .
make a lovely item for `` good morning , america ''
like hell !
well , then i 'm going to film it .
i will .
the only great white in captivity , calvin . all those people standing in line ...
a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack . you know how many are born ? maybe five . they eat each other before birth ! they 're born killers !
it 's one of the world 's greatest creatures .
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world 's ever known .
calvin , i insist i be allowed to capture it !
it 'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes .
no !
calvin , let me go down there and kill the bastard .
i 've handled sharks before . bigger than this one .
you can get killed !
that 's preposterous !
i think we can capture it . i 'd like to try .
that 's a load of codswopple . a great white does n't fear man . it does n't fear beast . it 's an orgy of food and blood .
sharks are man-biters , mister hutton . not man-eaters --
unhappy combination . most likely one 's inside the other .
well , we 'll just try again , dear . keep working on it . maybe you 'll get it one of these years . pack up , boys . flipper 's a flop .
i 'm sorry .
well , i have to get this into the networks . if you ca n't do it , you ca n't do it , that 's all .
i told you , something 's upset them .
no , no . that wo n't do .
i can have them walk backwards .
i thought they were clever .
wait a minute . these are n't kangaroos , mr. hutton . they 're dolphins .
well then , can you have them jump to the camera over here ?
it 's no use . they wo n't come into the lagoon .
make this quick !
okay now . have flipper flip or something .
yes , are n't we all .
i do n't know . they 're nervous and skittish right now .
fine . have them do some .
they 're not tricks . they 're behavior patterns .
i just did . can you make them do tricks ?
nobody told me .
on the telly . we 're to film him for the evening news .
go where ?
we got it to live for ten hours . that 's some kind of record .
not good enough .
no one 's ever done it before . it was a good try ...
i should have never listened to calvin .
do n't blame yourself .
i knew it ; it 's my fault . we moved it too soon .
ten minutes ago .
when did this happen ?
and big for his age .
he 's a young one .
i know .
they still seem nervous .
i think they 'll come out now .
better than catching sean 's herpes .
i 'm neo-senephrened out . think i 'm catching a cold .
how you doing , kelly ?
hi , mike .
someone 's looking for you .
sean . sean , where are you ?
thanks .
sure . no problem .
kelly , could you look after sean for a while ? show him around for me ?
hope with none of my girl friends .
he 's missing .
musclehead ?
'preciate it .
sure .
give me a ride ?
sean !
take it up !
he 's diving !
take it up .
it 's okay , sean .
let 's go , let 's go !
what , hon ?
no ... it ca n't be .
goes up .
now what 's this do ?
told you you 'd like it .
can hardly wait to do it again .
is n't this fun !
i 'm not acting ! i do n't want to go in it , okay ?
sean , this is ridiculous . you 're acting very immature .
no , think of something else .
you 're not in the water . you 're in a gondola .
not for me . i do n't go in the water , remember ?
come on , it 's fun !
no , kelly , i do n't want to ...
yes , it 's great !
the one that goes underwater ?
i know ! we can take the gondola ride !

filter system number four . is it large enough ?
that 's impossible . if it 's that big , why has n't anybody seen it ? huh ? tell me that . it 's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool .

i 'll remember that , my lordship .
reach for the limit i always say .
yeah , tradition 's a bitch , ai n't it ?
tradition . royal sense of adventure that 's been in my family for centuries . dates back to the crusades and king richard . what i was born to do .

yeah , poor bastard .
your friend overman picked a hell of a time to come back .

this company 's expanding . they got parks in texas , ohio , california . i think i 'm gon na be going to waco .
you and kathryn gon na stay here ?
it 's not that easy . worked construction every summer to get through school . three years apprentice in the park 's engineering department , and two years to build all this . finish school first , sean . then make up your mind . if you still want to work with me , we 'll have plenty of time .
mike , this is fantastic . i mean , you 're responsible for building all this . what a job you 've done ! maybe i 'll quit school and come down here and work with you . brody brothers construction . we 've always wanted to do that together . boat building .
do n't hurry back .
okay , you two , have a good life without me . i got ta go .

he taught us good , though , did n't he , sean ? we were lucky to grow up the way we did .
that 's dad ...

big bust ! he confiscate their water pistols ?
last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring . gang of kids were using slugs in the pac-man games .
how is he ? still fighting crime ?
yeah , right .
he needs a haircut .

so was dad .
hey , i 'm proud of you , kid .
great . i got one b , two c 's , and eight incompletes .
how 'd you do in school ?
... i 'll go to mcdonalds .
in a restaurant . you sit there and they swim around you .

hey , what 's goin ' on , little brother !
absolutely . the audience will stain their drawers . i did .
you want to show this ?
she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that .
i would n't mind going down with her .
give me a 400-foot magazine ; we may be down there for a while .
that bugger moves fast .
we 'll shoot this with an .18 , boys .
it 's time for tea , grandma .
yes , i did .
you said it was n't polite to interrupt people ... .
yes , you can make sandwiches ... .
can i make sandwiches ... ?
my tea set . i got my tea set . thank you ... .
only children are my favorites . that means you , magee ... .
was uncle sean ever bad ? did you ever spank him ?
you 're welcome . i was the one who cried .
i do n't want to . i want to swing ... .
did you hear what i said ? come inside ... .
daddy , why ca n't i ... ?
not today . come on , thea ... .
but you always let me ... .
come on , sweetheart ... .
watch me , grandma ... .
it has its virtues . it has n't fallen down yet ... .
do n't bother hoagie ... .
sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the jeep .
thea ... .
that 's what grandmas are for .
you 'll spoil her .
i 'm sorry . please , carla . i did n't think there was any danger . i 'm sorry . i love you . both of you .
why did n't you tell us ? why did n't you tell us ?
i do n't know ... .
where 's my mother ?
how could you do that ? your own daughter ... .
where is she ?
she could have been killed ... you knew and you did n't tell us ... you let your mother think ... .
sweetheart ... .
it went away ... .
you knew ... ?
but it went away ... we would have known ... .
the doctor said she should be all right ... she 's in shock ... .
thea was attacked by a shark ... .
what 's wrong ? what happened ?
where have you been ... ?
they 're at the beach ... .
close the door .
i 've always wanted to make love to an angry welder . i 've dreamed of nothing else since i was a small boy .
i have work ... .
off ... .
no ... .
turn it off ... .
then do n't come any closer .
no fair , i 'm not armed .
i do n't know ... you ... i do n't know .
what the hell are we arguing about ?
why should there be anything wrong ? i 'm sitting around the house , enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage ... .
we do n't have anything straightened out . you 're uptight about something ... what 's wrong ?
i take out the garbage , because ... i 'm glad we got that straightened out ... .
because ... .
how come it 's my responsibility ?
i thought artists worked with their subconscious ... .
do n't give me that preoccupied scientist crap . i 'm trying to get ready for ... .
my brain is shrinking . there 's only so much room .
it does n't take much to remember what day they come ... .
tell matt he should be here ... .
i miss him , matt . i still ca n't believe he 's gone .
i 'll be right there .
we need beer ... .
big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks ... .
we need milk ... .
make a list .
we forgot to stop at the store .
she calls it , 'tourist on the loose . ' local government commissioned it . for the public beach ... .
it sure is ... .
it sure is good to be home ... .
my mother always told me , if god had intended us to ride parachutes for fun , we 'd have been born with free tickets ... .
like mother , like son ... .
chicken ... .
no way ... .
i 've always wanted to ride one of those ... .
please , mom . at least consider it . you should get away . you should n't be alone now ... .
what do i think ? i think it 's a lovely idea ... .
nowhere ... .
where are you going ?
it was a piece of wood . a shitty piece of wood . it 's not fair ... .
he was doing his job ... .
he was such a good-natured kid ... always going out of his way ... .
he told me you both did ... .
i bought him his first legal drink . he got so pissed that night ... .
you make sure they come ?
we 'll be there ... .
we will ... we 'll have a lot of time together . what are you going to do now ?
i do n't know what he thinks ... i do n't know what i think ... i do n't even know why i 'm talking about it ... it 's silly ... i 'm getting too old for this sort of thing ... .
maybe he 's got good taste ... i do n't think he 's spent much time with a woman like you ... .
part of me wanted to go off with him , the rest of me could n't ... i do n't know why he wants me ... .
give it some time , ellen ... see what happens .
i always thought when i grew up i 'd know what to do about things like this ... i do n't even know if he 's serious ... .
whatever happens next ... ..
beginning of what ?
it 's beginning ... .
all he did was kiss me ... .
do you enjoy dealing blackjack ?
at least he does n't have a beard ... .
i 'd be afraid of losing ... .
you want to try your hand at something ... ?
you 're not interfering , ellen ... .
you caught me ... .
henny youngman ... .
i should n't interfere ... my mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock ... .
i used to worry ... but you know what happens , you find out that scuba diving 's safer than climbing into the bathtub ... .
i ca n't help it ... .
usually it 's all he talks about ... you must n't worry ... .
do you and michael ever talk about his work ... ? about spending so much time working in the water ?
i could use a half-dozen more arms ... i 've only got two weeks to get this thing finished ... .
i like it . really ... .
it 'll grow on you .
i 'm not on vacation ... .
no cooking while you 're here ... no washing dishes ... no cleaning ... .
he knows what he has to do ... .
i hope the man knows what he 's doing ... .
we 'll divert it ... we 'll do something ... .
they wo n't kill it ... .
we 're going down . all of us ... .
bang sticks are like yelling at it ... .
get the bang sticks . we 're going down .
what difference does it make ? it 's here ... .
what the hell 's it doing in warm water anyway ... ?
you have something to say about everything ... .
sweet breezes ... sweet women ... .
spent it all on beer ... .
we have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it ... .
michael !
you rigged it ... you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this ... .
michael ! this thing working ?
i wo n't ... .
do n't be late .
a small one ... your brother wo n't be here ... .
a big one ... .
good .
he heard that .
ask the big doctor about his work . tough life you bahamian beach bum ... playing in the water all day ... .
i 'm on the phone ... .
you check it ... .
the fish . check it ... .
hello ? thea who ? i know it 's thea brody . how many grandchildren do i have ? i know you can use the phone by yourself . you 're a big girl . i know you 're five .
we do n't want any ... .
adds flavor ... .
are you all right ?
let me finish dinner before you eat it ... chop the peppers ... .
i 'm hungry , mom ... .
i see what you 're doing ... .
ca n't help myself ... .
serves you right . will you please stop ... .
that hurt ... .
i 'm not doing anything .
that ... .
stop what ?
stop that ... .
i 'll miss you ... .
i will . i 'll miss you , grandma .
good night , daddy ... .
i 'll be in to read you a story .
thanks for the consultation ... .
i put everything in my room . my teddy bear is joining us .
i did n't .
i almost forgot ... .
the water 's coming in ... the water 's coming in ... .
what 's it cost to take a ride on that plane ... ?
it 's not nice to be evasive .
no one . nothing . we 've got to get this finished before the tide comes in .
who 's coming ?
you 're coming , are n't you ... ?
you 're silly ... .
we have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around ... so we can swim to it ... .
i 'm still five ... .
your father was six then . just like you ... .
mommy lets me ... .
no , no ... it 's too dangerous ... .
thank you ... .
i like grandma 's cooking ... .
where 's the lady who brings the soda ?
i never ... .
it 's too dangerous ... .
can i ride one sometime ... ?
i 'd like that . i need to be away from here .
you can stay in my room .
yes !
what 's going on ?
in a minute ... .
i 'm going to finish what jake and i started . i owe him that . hell , i owe him everything ... . i 'll get something important done for both of us ... .
we will ... we 'll have a lot of time together , michael ... .
i 'll wear my rubbers ... i 'll be careful ... i 'll be ... .
promise me ... .
promise me you 'll be all right ... .
there 's a lot ... i want to talk about it ... .
i want you all to come to amity this summer .
why 'd you take the boat ?
why 'd you come out here ?
it got him ... .
no .
you hungry ?
i 'm tired of hearing about it . there 's no shark . sean was n't killed by the same shark.. dad did n't die because of it ... it 's all wrong ... some fantasy you 've concocted ... you keep bringing it up .
it 's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe .
i do n't want to talk about that .
you looked just like your father ... the first time the shark came to amity ... .
i 'm your mother . it 's my job ... .
there 's nothing to worry about ... .
i 'm worried.. we have n't had our ... .
i m not unhappy . frustrated maybe ... discouraged a little . it 'll work out ... .
i 'm leaving in a few days . i do n't want to do that with you unhappy ... .
i have to get this finished .
you and sean used to make ... .
i 'm fine ... .
you look tired ... .
trying to write our report ... .
it 's late ... .
children are never satisfied . i have my house , my friends , my job ... my life , michael . i have to live it . besides , i 'll be back . now show your mother what a good dancer you are .
you just got here ... .
no more sharks . i 'll stay for another week , then ... .
i 'm pleased . i really am . really ... .
that 's it ? good ... i thought you 'd break out the champagne ... .
good .
it 's not easy . none of it is . i have to find some way to get on with my life and i 'm going to try . i finally figured that out . i 'm going to do my best ... .
will you let me finish . i 've been working on this all day .
you 're not a pain in the ass ... .
i 'm not going to bother you anymore about your work ... .
he 's not chasing and i 'm not running . and that 's ridiculous ... .
i do n't like him chasing around after you ... i do n't trust him ... .
i enjoy his company ... .
i am .
you 're having a good time ... .
you 're all i have left ... i do n't want you going in the water ... .
i 'm not going to quit now ... .
you could teach ... you could ... .
mom , please do n't start that again ... .
i want you to give up your work ... .
once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window ... .
nothing out of the ordinary ... .
good . so will i ... .
i 'll be all right , michael .
we have n't had a real talk , have we ? we 'll do that before i go .
okay .
how are you doing ?
i 'm fine ... .
all you all right ?
you were a monkey ... .
do n't be such a grandma ... i was always climbing something ... .
i did n't mean to start that ... .
come on , i 'll show you around .
oh , i did n't mean ... . i 'm being such a grandma ... .
it 's jake 's actually ... our floating lab ... .
oh , it looks like my uncle 's . he taught me how to sail when i was a kid ... .
your brother 's dead ... your father 's dead ... .
there 's never been a great white where we live . it 's warm water ... they do n't like it ... .
he died from fear ... from having to go out there after it ... .
dad died from a heart attack ... .
it picked sean ... it killed your father ... .
hey , come on , you ca n't believe that voodoo . sharks do n't commit murder . they do n't pick out a person ... .
i wo n't have anyone in my family any- where near the water ... . never again ... never ... .
mom , you 're upset . sit down ... please ... .
i do n't want you in the water anymore ... .
i 'm just getting started ... .
you 're damn right i 'm serious ... .
come on , mom , you ca n't be serious ... .
i want you to give up that terrible job .
what ?
i want you to get out of the water ... .
you guys must be starving ... .
sit down , ma ... .
mother ... .
it came for him . it waited all this time and it came for him ... .
yes you can ... .
i ca n't ... .
give me a hand here for christ 's sake ... .
i tried to tell you ... i tried ... .
my vision is perfect ... .
you sure you do n't need glasses ?
the whole idea is preposterous ... .
there 's nothing to be sorry about .
i 'm sorry ... i ... .
because it would n't occur to you to know why . blushing suits you ... .
why ?
i have this overwhelming desire to kiss you , ellen brody .
there are ... i 'm tired of one-way conversations ... .
there must be plenty of women who would be glad to go ... .
only if he finds out ... it 's a short hop to the caribbean . we could take a few days ... .
wo n't you get in trouble ... ?
i borrow it without telling him ... .
what ?
i 'll nick the boss ' plane again ... .
i like to travel ... .
you 're always taking time off ... .
i could take some time off ... .
i dreamed about always being warm ... stay a while ... .
that 's hard to imagine ... .
i tried winter once . burlington , vermont . flew a run to new york . i have a bone in my foot that still has n't thawed . when i was a small boy ... .
but it gets cold in winter ... .
i have my own little island .
our little island seems to agree with you ... .
good . i have two left ... .
i have two right feet .
you 'll be sorry .
would you suffer through a dance with me ?
no !
all or nothing . you want to roll them for me ?
you 're not going to bet it all ... .
couple of more passes and i 'll buy my own airplane.. hell , maybe my own airline ... .
a big one ... .
a big one ... .
a drink with an umbrella in it ... .
give it up ... kick it in the ass ... get on with your life ... .
the kind with an umbrella in it ... .
sharks come and go , ellen . people do n't have anything to do with it ... .
you promised me a drink ... .
i 'm terrific ... come on ... .
no , you 're not ... .
i 'm fine .
nothing ... .
what 's wrong ?
it 's wonderful ... .
how do you like flying ?
the plane 's turning ... .
they took me to the chief , who took a long look at me , then took me in his hut ... .
you 're impossible ... .
got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters ... .
you 're not going to tell me , are you ?
one time i was flying supplies up the amazon . went down in the jungle ... .
i 'm only doing this to get out of my family 's hair ... .
you 're doing fine . i 'll keep you out of trouble . relax ... .
where do i pull off ... ?
it 's just like driving a car ... .
if you do n't take it , we 'll be swimming in a minute .
what are you doing ?
no one does till they learn ... .
i do n't know how ... .
sure you can ... .
i ca n't ... .
boss ' day off ... take the wheel ... .
how can you just take the plane like this ?
does n't matter ... .
depends on where you want to go ... .
when it killed sean it was like a stab in the heart . i knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him . i knew that . i know it 's coming ... .
i 'm not saying you 're wrong , just that there are other possibilities ... .
it was no accident ... .
it could have been an accident ... .
sometimes i think i 'm going crazy . the nightmares ... .
i always listen to my feelings ... .
i ... i ca n't explain it . it 's just something i feel .
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier ... .
i do n't know why i 've told you all this . i hardly know you .
mostly it feels like driving . you digging for buried treasure ?
flies the plane ... .
i 'm the captain of this majestic ship . it goes where i take it ... .
can you just go off ... ?
you must get bored easily .
first time for everything is the best . after that you know too much and it 's never quite the same .
no ... .
i own the airplane . i can do whatever i want . i 'm the boss .
yes i can ... .
can you keep a secret ? something no one else knows ?
just like that ?
hurry !
i 'm the artist . like my mother .
you the architect ?
you 're the man who drives the plane .
i do n't know why i fish here ... never catch anything ... must be a sign under the water ... 'beware , hoagie 's here ... . '
i do ... .
want to go for a little ride ?
the wind does that . ever been to the bahamas before ?
how come it bumps up and down when there 's no road ?
i 'll get it back next time .
i 'm too young for coffee . can i drive the plane ?
i have coffee in the thermos .
they had them on the big one ... .
aye , aye , captain ... .
keep it steady ... .
they spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it they do n't care what it is ... .
maybe the plane gave it indigestion ... .
get her started ... .
what say we get the hell out of here , ellen brody . ...
will you get the bloody hell out of here ... .
it 'll come for the plane . it 's attracted to metal . the electro- magnetic impulse ... .
hell , that was n't half bad.. get going ... i 'll keep it busy ... .
hell , no . what kind of pilot do you think i am ... ?
you sure you know how to do this .
grab your socks ... .
she said it was coming ... .
what do you mean , it 'll find her ?
she 'll be all right , partner.. she 'll never find it . we could n't ... .
when we find her we 'll radio her position ... the coast guard will pick her up . do n't worry ... .
you got a better idea ... ?
you 're going after her in that ? you 're crazy ... it 'll take all day in that bathtub ... .
a shark attacked thea and some kids ... she 's going after it ... .
i hope she 's a good sailor ... .
we 'll buy you one . we 're having a party ... .
it was theirs anyway . i 11 buy us all a drink ... .
it needs more time to charge .
the damn thing is going to have our asses ... .
nothing ! what the hell are you doing down there ?
what happened ?
all you passengers are the same ... . complain ... complain ... .
come on , hoagie ... .
any faster and it 'll turn into a flying cuisinart and dice us into oblivion ... .
ca n't this thing go any faster ?
i fly elephants for smugglers ... .
what do you deliver on all those charters you ... ?
what 's that ... . ?
i want you to leave her alone . i do n't want you involving her in ... .
the world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers .
mind if i cut in ? your date 's lonely ... .
good news travels fast ... .
jake tells me you 're going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table ... .
you too , michael ... .
i 'll get her . have a good christmas , matt ... .
let me speak to ellen ... .
it was like having snow in the house ... jesus , i miss them .
feathers all over the place ... .
the stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing ... .
oh , boy ... .
would you talk to her ? she 's got it in her head that the shark came for him . she still blames it for my father 's death ... .
she 's had a lot to deal with ... she needs time ... .
i wish there was something i could do ... .
she 's a tough lady ... .
she has good days and bad ... i do n't know ... .
how 's ellen ?
inch by inch ... .
tricky little devils , are n't they ? how 's the degree doing ?
we 'll be done pretty soon ... .
still tagging conch ?
still chasing fish ?
yeah ... .
you do n't have to say anything , matt ... i know how you feel ... .
i do n't know what the hell to say ... .
tell thea i 'm sorry ... .
matt ?
i 'm the one who wanted to study it ... .
jake .
we need it to eat electronics , man ... not you . get it on me ... .
it 's my fault ... i have to ... .
no way ... .
i 'll do it , jake .
my equipment does n't crap out ... .
your equipment has crapped out again ... .
i forgot my rubber gloves . let 's do it .
the big picture ... if we ca n't get him to swallow it , we 'll shove it up his ... .
wait for the sucker to charge , then hit the switch . just like taking a picture .
if we 're real lucky , it 'll eat itself ... .
theory , partner ... if it responds to external electrical impulse , it might respond to one coming from inside it ... confuse it ... drive it away ... .
it 'll work ... .
all the time ... .
anybody ever tell you you 're nuts ... .
if it works , if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off , it 'll shock the hell out of it . we 'll need a slave switch to set it off . pull the dry cell out of the radio .
you jump , you 'll kill yourself ... .
i 've got to get to her ... .
what the hell are you doing ?
mom ... .
holy christ ... .
screw you , jake ... .
you told me what ?
tough shit . 'when the shark bites with his teeth , dear ... '
i do n't like the song .
you do n't like my voice ... ?
stop that !
you 'll be the eternal tropo ... the old man and the sea ... know the words to this one ? 'oh , the shark has pretty teeth , dear , and he shows them pearly white ... '
shove it ... .
do n't be so down , man . money 's gone ... shark 's gone ... we 're back to conch ... we 've got it made ... .

'it got us in hot water ... we should have been there for carla ... . '
'snuck up on me ... . '
'a moray eel ... . '
'it was so ugly ... it was so big ... . '
a moray eel ... a moray eel ... .
just trying to be helpful ... .
funny , jake ... funny .
maybe he only likes white meat ... .
how come only me ?
nothing ... hey michael ... you know i was thinking about yesterday . maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry ... .
what about the monitor ... ? you getting anything on the shark ?
i live to hear the sound ... you all right ?
you getting a reading on them ?
she 's not going to like it ... .
i 'm going down , jake ... .
what about carla 's gig ?
i did n't ask you to ... .
i do n't like it ... .
you fall off a horse , you get right back on or you do n't ride again ... .
it 's my turn in the barrel , man ... .
close ... i do n't know ... just get the hell ... .
i 'm coming ... how close is it ?
nothing.. but stay within a quarter mile ... i 've got a three-mile radius on the monitor . if he comes back i 'll hear him . you 'll have time to get up .
i 've got about a half dozen ... i 'm going to tag them . you hearing anything ?
maybe it 's gone ... .
if you had n't been gassing about hoagie ... .
maybe the gear crapped out ... .
we lost it ... .
i hear he flies a lot of private charters ... .
he gambles ... he likes a good time ... i see him around ... .
i am ... you must know something about him ... .
half do n't ... bring her about ... .
half the pilots down here fly drugs ... he 's always going off ... .
bring her about . we 're headed in the wrong direction ... .
you think he 's not good enough for her ? you 're right . if she was my mother , i 'd send her home right now .
what 's so funny about that ?
what do you know about him ?
i do n't remember . one day he was just here ... .
hoagie .
who ?
how long has he been here ... ?
bring her to starboard .
as long as he 's been here ... .
how long ?
what the hell does hoagie have to do with this ?
how long have you known hoagie ?
what ?
how long have you known hoagie ?
shit ... .
what she 's got . nine knots ... .
what are we getting out of this old bucket ?
so far..
and it 's always worked ?
lots of times ... .
you sure you 've done this before ?
you do n't know shit about anything . time you learned ... .
i do n't know shit about electronics ... .
so did i ... .
i thought we were planning a long rosy future together .
the shark will get it for us .
my name goes on that report . it 's a half-assed job , i do n't get my doctorate . neither do you ... .
we 've got a rare bird here , michael . great whites do n't come to the bahamas . there 's never been one down here before . i 'm not just going to let it swim away .
we have at least three months ' work left . we ca n't write a report ... we do n't know enough ... .
okay ... we got it together ... .
we got it together , jake ... .
when i invited you ...
when i signed on ... .
when i got the grant ... ..
when we got the grant ... .
okay.. .we 're done , man ... .
we do n't write up anything until we 're done ... .
we 're out of money , partner.. we wrap it up , write it up and turn it in ... how come your heart sounds stronger than mine ? you got two of them ... ?
as the sun slowly sets in the west , we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch ... .
what for ? we 've got a job to finish ... why are you making the monitor ?
gave them the day off ... .
what happened to clarence and ... ?
down here ... .
where is everybody ?
do n't say anything about this to my mother ... .
you guys are making this into some- thing that just is n't so ... it 's just a shark . a great big bloody wonderful shark . do n't say anything to anyone . the locals find out they 'll panic . they 'll want to kill it . we 've got us a great white , michael . we 're going to do us some real research ... .
holy shit !
trouble with you , jake , is you have no sense of humor ... .
spade 's a garden tool ... .
what ?
i wish you would n't say that ... .
i 've struck the mother-lode . i 'm counting ... spade work ... .
oh , it 's okay for you , but not for me ... .
stop busting my hump ... .
how many ?
you 're nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics . you 're never going to amount to anything .
he 's just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own ... .
you 're afraid of the competition out there ... .
it 's not a bad life , jake ... .
a regular tropo ... spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit , living off nickel and dime grants . you want to be a bum all your life , be my guest . not me . i 'm not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot ... .
i know a guy who got money from them to study eels ... .
they put bombs on dolphins ... .
money is money ... .
forget it ... .
office of naval research has some money ... .
may your sex life be as busy as your shirt ... .
sharp shirt , jake ... .
i did n't do it on purpose ... .
bad boy ... .
where the hell 's the beer ... ?
maybe i missed you too ... .
put me down , damnit ... .
they wo n't fight with me ... .
put me down ... .
i missed you , is all . it 's dull around here working alone ... smelling all that sweet cologne ... .
yeah , well , just stop yelling .
should n't pick on that . sorry . i 'm sorry about your brother ... .
hey !
you leave me high and dry ... you come back looking like a zombie ... .
you could n't find your ass with both hands ... .
a blind man could find more conch on a mountainside ... .
if you made them right , it would n't happen ... they leak ... .
you did n't stick them on right ... .
i stuck them on , man ... .
i made them , man ... .
maybe it 's the tags that suck ... .
the readings suck ... .
i know how to tag a damn conch ... .
if you 'd leave me alone , i 'd be able to get my work done ... .
if we had some decent money , i 'd be able to read their temperatures ... study their motor systems ... .
we 're being paid to see where they go ... how they propagate ... .
we 'll pass around cigars ... .
the females have eggs ... .
you moved any slower , you 'd grow roots ... we 've got a schedule ... shake it , man ... .
i 'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen ... .
you tagging them ... ?
will you leave me alone ... ?
how many ... ?
try the area around the wreck ... .
stop busting my hump ... .
stop farting around ... .
you want to be careful how you talk to me ... i 'm about to become famous ... you should see ... .
when he has a pillow over his head ... .
woman has taste ... .
i 'd have to manage a nookie parlor to do that ... .
manage the whole damn place some day . i 'm looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed ... .
i 'm training to ... .
she 's in management ... .
i 'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair .
i just want to make an honest woman of you ... .

what ?
i 'm glad of it . i 'd rather please you than anybody i know of . oh , darlin ' , will you give me something ?
yes .
did you like that , mama ?
we only got one .. he does n't drive .
how about any guys on your staff ?
only me and mom ..
i 'm sorry to worry you with this , but we had a real serious robbery , and we- 're chasing a white v.w . van ? you guy came up an the computer , so as a matt- er of routine we have to check . could you tell me who 's driven it recently ?
no , my mother 's .. you better stop in .. i 'm just here to feed the cat .
is it your vehicle ?
the van ?
i 'm afraid it 's the `` van '' again .
as i said , sergeant , you nearly ran into < u > me < /u > ? what 's the problem ?
that 's a liability , ross . i do n't want you hanging on to my shirt . anyone but me comes down these stairs , take em out but try and keep him alive . i want this bastard living ..
you ai n't going in alone ?
alright . i 'll start at the top , and work down .
we 're not < u > here < /u > . i do n't want the desk to hear us ..
what if we need a back up ?
< u > hit those wipers , ross < /u > .
policemen 's bodies age at diff- erent rates . look at me . gut in its fifties . balls in their six- ties . and feet in their eighties ..
what d'you mean , `` bits . ''
bits .
bull shit .. i 'm in my prime ..
it 's twenty of three .
i guess by the bed .
where 's your watch ?
hey ..
listen , you do n't havta come ?
this `` cop '' that 's calling , thinks she gon na be there over christmas .
now ?
i 'm going up to the institute .
what exactly you doing , john ?
i spose i 'm drinking myself to sleep . it 's helena 's christmas songs .. they 're really pretty ..
jesus . what are you doin ?
that 's just what i wan na find out .
hey , john , do n't start getting antsy over this tonight . it may well have been the local cops ?
you got a quiet phone somewhere ?
are you sure you did n't call ?
yeah .. i guess she 's in the kit- chen .. we got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
do n't thank me . thank margie .
ca n't thank you enough , ross ..
screw citrine . he can fire me .
what about citrine ?
i dunno what i 'd do with your help . i 've got ta take her out of there ..
i dunno what i can do to help you ?
do n't give me that ! < u > not another < /u > < u > word < /u > ! when you had the fat lady in there , and i asked you if she was lying , you looked me right in the eyes and said < u > yes < /u > . so as far as i was concerned , < u > she 's ly- < /u > < u > ing < /u > . and if the king of fucking england had walked in & told me different , i would n't have bel- ieved him - because < u > you < /u > told me ..
everything you say sounds reason- able . but there 's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite .
< u > i 'm sick of this toy town shit < /u > .
ease off , john ..
how the hell do i know < u > who < /u > ? some jerk-off . some peeping-tom prick .
i 'm asking it .
that 's a very stupid question , ross .
no .. you did n't know that ..
well .. i did n't know that ..
< u > one hundred fucking per cent < /u > ! .. and you know why ? coz i never told her good-bye . o.k. ? is that good enough for the `` committee ? ''
you do n't really believe this ?
i 'm already familiar with taylor 's opinion .
i 'm not in here to apologize , john . i told you what was gon na happen & it 's happened ? `` good-bye , princess , '' & the same night she gets attacked ? that 's a tough one to swallow , bro ?
nothing you got ta say do i wan na hear right now . so save yourself saying it .
alright , enough , ross . you 'll bring on my `` nervous tick '' ...
you do n't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved ?
sure .
alright , she was n't lying about the van . but it could have been < u > any < /u > van ? any little foreign diesel ? .. she 's < u > blind < /u > , bro .. it 's sad .. she 's pro- bably lonely , and you 're a nice guy to have around .. but you 're getting far too far into the element , brother ..
she was n't lying about the van .
you 're a fucking great policeman , but give yourself a break . you 're here 5 minutes , you find yourself a fucking homicide ? .. not many people could do that in a place like this .. and you got ta admit , there 's a lot of shaky areas in this case ? .. i mean , stop me if i 'm going up the wrong nostril ..
just makes to so god damned mad ..
you got ta stop calling los angeles .. you 're dragging l.a. around with you like an addiction . look at the shit you 're putting yourself through ? for what ? for < u > nothing < /u > , i know it , i been there . remember me ? up to my asshole in anger , living off the vitamins in cigarettes ? if there 's a body under the snow , < u > fuck < /u > < u > it < /u > . let somebody else worry about it . you got ta accept you stopped living in that world , & try and give yourself a break in this ..
john , < u > stop < /u > < u > it < /u > . the case is on its ass , you 're closed . c'mon , let it go for once .. have a drink . c'mon , relax , drink your beer ..
i never knew about the sailor the- ory , ross . he might have that one little thing i need in his files ?
stop it .
no god , brother . if there was a god , asses would n't be at the perfect height for kicking .
god , it pisses me off , ross .
car accident .
why 's she blind , bro ?
he did n't shoot it , ross . and no way by accident . there 's a flash-burn . it was point-blank .
no , i think you 'll find i looked like he could have ? by accident even ? he 's up here spraying the scenery all day .
you looked like you did ?
did i say he did ?
i wish he 'd tell that to citrine .
i dunno , i dare n't go in there - just about get her wired up , and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff ? we should be out chasing major violators ..
all but .. how < u > you < /u > doing ?
did he shut you down ?
what does it matter what i bel- ieve ? .. what you got ta worry about is what citrine believes ..
you believe me , do n't you ?
i was wrong .
that is n't what you said before .
we 've fused into a major series , ross . this girl is n't the second victim . this is `` jennifer < u > eight < /u > . ''
for a < u > dead < /u > < u > dog < /u > ?
i wan na take that fucking blind in- stitute to pieces .. every address book , every phone call , everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
listen to me saying what ?
that 's what i 'm here for . i want you to come and see citrine with me ? he 's not gon na here it from me but i know he 'd listen to you .
identity of whom ? you got a girl , does n't even have a driver 's lic- ense ? .. she 's untraceable , john .. you need fifty detectives on this .
they possibly did - but they nev- er had a head , so they never had a bullet - and they never got an i.d . - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we 're the first to get a positive identity .
how come the f.b.i . do n't put anya this together ? they work- ed over `` jennifer '' for months ?
six girls over a period of 18 months , and give or take a head or two , the m.o . 's exactly the same . dark hair . no hands . all shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head .
you want me to stop the car ?
i remember the old bastard 's liver ! i do n't believe you did that . i had a great sent- imental attachment to that .
it 's not your friend . it keeps you sucking . remem- ber the old bum 's lungs ?
what are you doing , ross ? i 've had that 15 years ! ..
to throw out of the window .
what do you want it for ?
i do n't want excuses , i want that weird-looking stuff called `` cash . ''
i had one < u > puff < /u > on a < u > pipe < /u > .
i need some security . i do n't trust you anymore .
why ?
then give me that zippo .
i have n't got it .
pay me , and i shut up .
do n't start again . if you win a bet , you ca n't keep winning it ..
so am i. but where 's my money ?
maybe not ? i 'm feeling lucky ..
forget it . they got stringent hyg- iene rules . he 's long gone in lime .
we 're going .
no way .. not me , mister . i 'm not going up there again . might find someone 's prick in a hot-dog roll .
alright , i did n't , but i nearly did , and if i had i 'd have been right .. i knew there was some- thing about that labrador , that dog was too good to be dead .. we got ta get back up that dump ..
no , you did n't .
had a seeing eye dog since she was eighteen .. did n't i tell you those dogs meant something ..
< u > what < /u > ? she 's < u > blind < /u > , bro . you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano ?
let me just keep going a while . she might remember something ?
thank christ we got a witness .
this looks promising .. i think this one could be it ?
i dunno .. i guess this is staff side of the building ?
where is everyone ?
i think i got something - twenty two years old , dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - last seen < u > 5 weeks ago < /u > ..
pig woman agreed to take a test .
no you do n't . that 's how you < u > think < /u > you feel about him . that 's how you feel about < u > yourself < /u > . you wo n't give yourself one-fucking-minute for < u > you < /u > .
o.k . and i 'm not in love with this fukker ? that 's how i feel about him .
because i dislike her too much ..
why do n't you dump the `` fat lady ? ''
why do n't you dump it ? mail it off . give the fucking f.b.i . a present ?
what do you mean , ross ?
worrying - clicking - picking - you may as well be back in los angeles .
what do you mean ?
a dollar ? .. not worth giving up for a dollar ..
someone bet me a dollar ..
how 'd you do it , old man ?
i do n't mean this `` system '' shit that keeps you sucking , i mean < u > stop < /u > .. i was exactly like you are .. i used to wake in the night - heart going so hard i coulda made love with my left tit .. if i can stop , < u > you < /u > can ..
i < u > am < /u > stopping smoking ...
you got ta stop smoking ..
find yourself a farmer 's daughter with nice big fucking tits , and shake that `` bye-bye . '' send it to sacramento , john .. i sniff grief ..
maybe ?
you want my advice ?
because it 's a ritual you got ta go through with . i 'm down to 10 .
why do n't you throw them all away , and smoke none ?
it 's a technique i read about . if you smoke 60 a day , you buy three packs , throw one cigar- ette away , and smoke 59. day 2 , you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
it 's a method for quitting smoking .
he thinks you stole his promotion . what exactly you doin there , john ?
i already did . what 's his problem ?
it 's an `` unsolved . '' they spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - you might wan na check it with taylor , he worked the case .
watch my lips .. < u > do n't get into it < /u > ..
there 's nothing in the files ?
because , do n't get into it ...
why so coy about the word `` frozen '' ?
seven thirty-five .. here , `` town gets top cop . '' i was gon na pin it to your wall .
what time is it ?
c'mon , just shut your eyes until it 's painted . you 're gon na love it . this is `` god 's country , '' john .
not too good in daylight ..
what does that mean ?
o.k .
how 's the new residence ?
since when did you drink diet soda ?
not today .. i 'm on a diet to- day .. i 'll take a diet soda ..
what d'you mean , i just opened it for you ? this is < u > french < /u > champagne .
not for me ..
a professional , whining , con-person bitch with an ass the size of africa ..
who is who ?
think i 'll lay down with him . only way i 'll get outta here .
yeah , he can go ...
two dogs . he should do the dogs .
the < u > dogs < /u > ?
we give it one more hour . did the photographer do the dogs ?
i think you 're here all day .
what do you think ?
oh , shit . of course . the kid . < u > travis < /u > . find that kid and get the knife off him . he 's gon na lie to you - but he 's got it - so < u > get < /u > it . well , go on , get on with it . whatta you staring at ?
what about that kid , ross ?
watch my lips , coz you 're not gon na believe this - < u > this < /u > is a rare occurrence . we have n't had a body in eighteen months .
so what happened to the barbecues , and fishing ?
uh huh .. he 's well rehearsed ..
mr blattis , of our local news- paper . you sure it 's a suicide ?
`` welcome to eureka . ''
no , sir . i have n't started till monday . i 'm a `` tourist . ''
you heard . look for the knife .
i dunno .. guess the dozer musta shifted him ? you need some hands up here to look ..
old guy , offed himself with a knife . i ca n't find the knife .
be my guest . what you got ?
i hope i 'm not intruding ?
did you bring it with you ?
i am calm .. < u > i am calm < /u > ..
you ai n't talking to no one , till you calm down .
i 'll sign anything you want . < u > please < /u > . bring here her .. < u > i want helena here < /u > ..
coz i 'm < u > short of men < /u > & ang- elo wo n't do it .. who ever i got free first - < u > you < /u > < u > get < /u > ..
i want serato .. why ca n't i have serato ?
alright , you got it . and i 'll be putting an observer in with you .
no .
and did they ?
i never asked if he could `` see . '' i just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything ?
he says , you freaked one of em out ? `` asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see , ' is both cruel , and dangerous '' ..
that 's bullshit ,
got a letter from this goodridge guy ? says , you 're upsetting his students ?
once .
i 'm talking , outside the girl ?
three or four .
do n't underestimate me .. the mayor 's pissed - but that 's nothing to do with this - sit down - how many times have you been up at that institute ?
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman ?
i 'm shutting you down on this `` blind thing , '' john .
we have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor 's dummy wearing a brassiere - < u > and a bill < /u > < u > for seventeen dollars for its wig < /u > !
we have a multiple homicide , sir ..
i < u > have < /u > heard you . you just do n't like hearing < u > me < /u > . you got this whole damned thing outta proportion . i do n't know what you gotten used to in los angeles , but i do n't believe there 's a police chief , < u > in this country < /u > , would put a task force together for a body part ..
if you 're not gon na hear me , chief ..
she 's < u > not < /u > `` missing . '' did she shout ? did she scream ? did he coerce her ? < u > no < /u > . she left of her own free will .. and if she gets on a plane and goes to peru with the prick , she 's still not missing . you got no case , john .
it 's < u > her < /u > hand . < u > her < /u > scars . < u > her < /u > dog . her dog 's shot . and she 's missing .
it could be anyone 's hand . illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
no , sir .
have you got a print from the hand ?
no .
have you got a match on the bullet ?
he < u > has n't < /u > hidden it . he never made a hit this far north before , and he never read a weather forecast .. she 's probably fifteen feet from the highway , three feet under snow .
then < u > where 's the body < /u > ? .. where 's the body , and < u > why 's he hidden it < /u > ?
coz this is a major & we 're closer to this bastard than anyone 's ever been .
you 're pushing this too hard . it 's like you < u > want < /u > me to say < u > stop < /u > ? you must know that 's the way this is going , john ? there 's other work to do , why do n't ya ease off a little ?
i 'm not telling you what to do . what i will say , is < u > right < /u > < u > now < /u > , that child 's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
what do you want me to do , chief ?
sucked in officers from all over the county . and it was the worst six months this station ever had .
i thought it was taylor 's case ?
probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall . he worked a lotta time on this .
yeah , that 's all very inter- esting , but where 's the body ?
i got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
i do n't see that at all ..
yes , sir , i think they maybe . i think `` jennifer , '' and this lady got hit by the same guy ?
what is all this jennifer stuff ?
hair on her hand . plus jen- nifer had raven black hair .
how do you know her hair 's black ?
laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it 's really bothering me .. see these striations right here ? it 's like she 's always worrying the end of her finger ? rubbing it with a thumb nail , or something ?
what is that ?
that , i could n't tell you .. and do n't worry about anya this crap , by the time you 're back it 's gone ..
why did he ask if it was frozen ?
maybe he 's lying to you ?
kid told me he did n't take it ?
no .. but we have a theory ..
did you find the knife , sergeant ?
popeye was n't old . younger than you .
i think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - i think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
did he get you the job ?
average rainfall , 48 inches . pisses down , october to june .
is this normal ?
your predecessor . he did- n't like to get outta bed . catch you later , freddy t ..
my pleasure .. who 's popeye ?
alright , gentlemen , i 'm gon na leave you . i got a couple of questions for the paper , serg- eant ? mind if i swing by later , wring out a tea-bag with you ?
cut your own throat , you 're ner- vous about it , tend to hesitate . he 's got three trial cuts , lower left side of the neck , before he works up courage for the big one .
what does that mean , sergeant ?
fucken noddle 's hanging off ..
week or two . musta been on the ker- osene . stinks like a diesel engine .
you < u > have n't < /u > . and you got no voice in here , taylor , < u > so keep it shut < /u > .
i 've heard you call him freddy .
i 've told you the truth . it is n't me .. i 've never call- ed ross `` freddy '' in my life ..
he ai n't offerin me shit .
he 's offerin you a deal ? why do n't you take it ..
well , her , it ai n't . that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat .
i know what a `` witness '' is .
< u > if < /u > , your friend from san diego was up here , and thought for < u > one < /u > out of < u > two fucken seconds < /u > , she was a danger to him , he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
you do n't know what you done , taylor .
just walk away from me , taylor ..
hey , c'mon , country boys , let 's all line up and hear the expert .
do n't you know nothing about this guy ? he < u > reads < /u > the newspapers . col- lects the cuttings . when are they gon na find her ? now he 's reading helena robertson 's name , phrased like she 's a fucking witness . you could n't have done anything more stupid if you 'd sat down & tried ..
bullshit .
so read it ! you just hung a target around her neck !
alright , i gave him the case ? .. so the case is closed , so what ?
do n't lie , taylor . i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case !
i may have said some- thing . i do n't recall .
< u > you < /u > put it in there .
his blind friend got `` attacked . '' angelo went up there , and some- how , it got itself in the paper .
wrong cabinet .
vehicle references .
what are you looking for ?
.. feel like i 'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time , feel like i 'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. i 'm sorry , king j ..
how come he 's suddenly so forth- coming ? i 'd like to kick him right in the ass . if he 'd discussed it with me , i mighta gotten somewhere ..
yeah , in and outta frisco on the big boats .. every lead we had went right out to sea .. night , night , freddy t .. john ..
i see .. well , she 's teaching an- other class at four .. i 'd apprec- iate it if you do n't detain her ..
well , apparently , she saw amber the weekend she left , & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with .
as she 's a member of my staff , may i ask what this is about ?
yes , sir .
then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving , sergeant . what i said on the phone 's the same as i 'm saying now . i got no idea where amb- er is , or who it was took her there .
i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is ?
then what are you hoping i 'm gon- na do ? dissuade , or persuade you ?
i 'm afraid i ca n't give you an ans- wer to that , mr goodridge . as i ex- plained to your secretary , we 're do- ing a lotta looking , but we 're not even sure it 's her we 're lookin for ..
as recent as we have .. what ex- actly is your interest in amber ?
it 's not as bad as it sounds .. they ca n't refuse me bail . raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
i do n't want them to arrest you .
i think they 're gon na arrest me .
i wan na be near you ...
you do n't wan na sit here any more , sweetheart ..
i 'm blind because my father drank .
you do ?
i know about alcohol , john .
he does n't need my help .
then why did n't he kill me ?
he do n't know that . i did n't .
i ca n't identify him ..
coz he thinks you 're a witness .
why does he want to kill me ?
the man who killed amber is a psychopath . he was up at the in- stitute to < u > kill you < /u > - he do n't wan na kill rose - he was there to < u > kill you < /u > - that 's the truth - and i did n't wan na tell it to you - but that 's the reason i want you to stay at margie 's - coz i ca n't protect you here ..
< u > then explain it to me < /u > . i got enough darkness , do n't i ?
i know you 're trying to help me , but you do n't understand .
do n't say that . do n't you < u > dare < /u > say that .. < u > i believe you < /u > ..
no .. not now ..
i 'm going back to the institute .
she has an aunt , in vermont . i 'll take her there tonight .
please do n't ask no quest- ions now .. not right now ..
why ?
it 's not possible right now .
why ca n't i stay with you ?
alright , i 'm worried about christmas . i wish i had n't told him i 'd be back ..
you 're looking more worried now than when you `` decided to stop worrying '' ?
no i 'm not .
you 're looking worried again , helena ?
who ? probably angelo .. i 'll take care of it .. do n't worry , we- 're gon na find this guy , and everything 'll be o.k . .. o.k . ?
i do n't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
has he got your aunt 's address ?
coz you hardly said a word since you got here . but you been thinking pretty loud ..
you know ? how do you know ?
i know .
i have to talk to you , helena .
fifty-seven .. i do n't mind ..
which is what ?
just your age .
he said that ? what else did he say ?
he said you 're quite chubby . and you have a nervous tick .
really ? what did he say ?
ross told me .
how d'you know what i 'm like ?
i know what you 're like ..
i was married to her sister ..
have you known her long ?
she runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know , beauty salon ..
.. sorry your father , mother sis- ter , whatever .. i could n't take another day of it .. come on , i 'm gon na rob you of a cup of coffee ..
sorry ?
no , i do n't pray .. had a dream once , about god , just around the time i was getting well .. he was a nasty lookin little guy , moved into the apartment right on topa me .. i said , do n't you listen to people 's prayers ? he said , prayers ? not often . they 're junk mail .
you said , you were in the bad lands ?
pray ?
do you pray ?
i do n't know , i have n't read much . i do n't think poetry 's my kinda thing ?
no , wordsworth .. do you like poetry ?
yeah , that 'll do .. is that `` hamlet ? ''
`` thoughts that lie too deep for tears . ''
i know , but you pick on the one time in my life i like not to remember . i was in the bad lands . really not well . it 's something that happens to a lota cops . we do n't wan na talk about that .
you just asked me to ask you questions .
was . but i do n't like to talk about it .
are you married ?
there 's no one `` looking at you '' .. there 's hardly anyone in here . the only person looking at you , is me .
i 'm sorry .. i do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone 's looking at me ..
well , i 'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with .
oh .
no .
are you wearing a uniform ?
you should . it 's wonderful .
no .
hamlet . have you read it ?
what are you reading ?
it was probably the wind .
i 'm sorry , someone slammed the door on me . i could n't get out .
of course i would ..
if i came to the diner with you , would you bring me back ?
well , some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin , and this kind of car sounded `` hollow '' ..
i got ta admit , you 're one of them . just wish i knew what you meant by a `` hollow car ? ''
i suppose i 'm the worst witness you 've ever had ?
no problem . i 'm not in a hurry .
i 'm sorry . i 'll get my things .
no , just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door - no one home , so i followed the music ..
have you been here long ?
i do n't know .
what color was it ?
yes .
did amber have a dog ?
sometimes i look after friends dogs , if they go to dances , or something ?
lotta scratch-marks on your door ?
no .
d'you have a dog ? seeing eye dog ?
yes , i could smell it on his breath , like i can on your 's .
me ?
no . except he smoked . like you .
is there anything else you can tell me ? anything about him or her ? does n't matter how small ?
my hands ?
can i see your hands ?
no , it has a mind of its own .
the elevator was n't working ?
i do n't know . i guess she must have called him john ? i 'm mak- ing tea . would you like some ?
john ? .. you never said that on the phone ? .. what makes you think his name was john ?
why not ? you heard my voice ?
no .
when we spoke on the phone , did you know i was blonde ?
you must have some idea about him .
what kind of friend ? was he a boy friend ? an old friend ? new friend ?
well , i think i told you on the phone .. i went up to her room to say good-bye , and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while , while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
i 'm mr berlin . mr ross is right here . and mr ross is maybe gon na take a few notes , if that 's o.k. ? o.k . .. i 'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want , what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft- ernoon she left ? take your time , and nothing 's too trivial , o.k .
what d'you wan na ask , mr ross ?
the man from the f.b.i .
who sought the warrant ?
yes , sir .
you got a warrant for this ?
i dunno , sir . brought you up a chevy .
why ?
i been told to take your car in , sir .
what are you doing , travis ?
come on , michael , outta here , the guys trying to move in . i told you what we know , something else , you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
was n't frozen , was it , sergeant ?
then do me a favor , and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities , we do n't even know if it 's ours ? till we do i do n't want no one worrying about ..
grateful for your candor , sir .
.. we got a body part . we do n't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we 're gon na try and check it out . o.k . now you know as much as we do ..
c'mon , chief , if it 's sensitive , tell me .. i 'm not taking notes ..
interview over , blattis ...
no , sergeant , i got < u > no < /u > < u > idea < /u > with who . and i might add , that in another six weeks , a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here , & driving away for their christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name i-won't-know-either ..
and you got < u > no < /u > < u > idea < /u > with who ?
then let me put your mind at ease .. firstly , amber is n't `` blind '' - she has some useful vision - and second , this is n't a prison , it 's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability does n't mean my stud- ents do n't value their independence as much as anybody else - and amber was a very independent young woman - she decided to leave - so she left ..
yeah , i guess i do .
you find something curious in that ?
a blind girl can just walk out of here , and you do n't know who with ?
i 'm here , honey . i 'm right here .
is that margie ?
do n't mix very well with beer .
how you doing on those shoes ?
i think john , would < u > love < /u > it ...
you think john would like it ?
sure you can . anyway , parties are all about standing still ..
i have n't worn heels since i was 16. i do n't think i could walk in these ?
think he still thinks about her . but not like then . then was an obsession .
you think he still loves her ?
you know , he crashed . he just could n't come to terms with it .. john hates to lose , and he hated losing her .. every spare minute , he 's driving down to san diego , having a terrible time with her , getting drunk , and driving back .. you just do n't believe the amount he drank ..
what does that mean ?
suzanne ? very pretty . she was a semi- professional model . but a policeman 's wife she was n't . so one day , she just packed it and left . and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet .
what was she like ?
two or three years ago .
when did john divorce ?
got a handshake like a partially excited penis .
he 's not that bad of a guy .. ?
she married some english prick .
i would n't mind another b.e.e.r .
you want something , darling ?
well , that 's who she is . cept she ca n't run away .
except for the hair color , she looks just like suzanne ?
i 'm sure he is . but gettin in- to the `` element '' is a bad idea .
he 's happy , darlin ..
she 's a doll . but i wish he had n't brought her out here .
such a shame .. she 's a really sweet kid ..
even better .
no it is n't .. it 's californian ..
tonight i 'm feeling lucky ..
so tonight she confesses ?
freddy 's new obsession ..
friday night at city hall . got a great chance to frighten the fat .
bobby 's out .. what 's the hurry ?
dinner 's another night , darlin .. this is a drive-by . i got an hour ..
i 'm not giving him < u > pizza < /u > . i have n't seem him for a year ? i 'm gon na cook him a dinner .
no , c'mon , freddy , let 's have this out & over . you know what everyone thinks ? they think you 're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass . and no one 's blaming you for it , i hear she 's worth the flowers . but do n't come in here get- ting holy over us . sure i put it in the paper . coz i wanted to < u > stop < /u > this bullshit . i do n't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain . it 's pissing < u > me < /u > , & < u > everyone < /u > off .
shut up , king jay ..
he tells her , `` bye-bye , '' and she gets `` attacked . '' well , give me a fucking break ! there < u > is < /u > no `` ser- ial killer . '' stick her name up in neon , there 's still no serial kil- ler ! and i ai n't the only one say- ing it . everyone in this building is saying it . and i mean < u > everyone < /u > .
alright , guys . we stop this < u > now < /u > .
you think you 're the only guy ever worked a homicide ? i was a big-city cop too . and i bust- ed the clock on fucken jennifer . i know more about this man than you 'll over know - and that 's how i know it ai n't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
whass going on here ?
just easy on the words you 're putting in my face , sergeant ..
no one 's gon na make that gent . six months investigation , & the nearest we got , we thought he was a sailor .
hey , we 're not talking `` talk '' tonight .
ask him .
the coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict ?
i think i 've found a hand .
whatta you mean , `` horrible ? ''
i think i found some- thing horrible , sir
no , sir .
do n't annoy me , travis .
i wonder what would make him do a thing like that ?
his father 's the manager , sir . the kid was up there shooting vermin , and he found the body .
where do you fit in , trimble ?
a derelict .
damn a , it 's o.k . with a bit of luck i 'm goin home . what we got ?
he was waiting for you , sir . wait- ed a good while . said he 'd go down and take a look . i hope that 's o.k .
he has ? .. what 's he doing here ?
on the infill . the guy from l.a. 's just gone down there ..
i 'm already walking . where is it ?
you can drive down there , sir ..
you know i did n't ever want to hurt you .
oh jerry .
no .
i did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours ! i can make this work .
i 'm not trying to make history . _ 67 .
no one has ever dumped me .
listen to me , it 's over .
you 've never been alone and you ca n't be alone --
there is something missing here .
did n't hear it .
it 's over --
no .
listen to me !
-- stop --
do n't say it . we 're both ragged out right now .
i think you added the `` brutal . ''
what was our deal when we first got together ? brutal truth , remember ?
tell you what -- i 'd prefer loyalty..
go ahead . jump right on into my nightmare . the water 's warm . _ 65 .
it 's not `` love me . '' it 's not `` trust my handshake . '' it 's make the sale . get it signed . there should n't be `` confusion '' about that .
look , i do n't want a --
jerry . you and i are salespeople . we sell --
everything 's on the fucking run ! everything --
i have to finish my job --
could you just stop moving ?
it 's all about you , is n't it ? soothe me , save me , love me --
oh honey . it 's spun .
what do i do ? how do i spin this ?
i just heard .
jerry ! do something --
this ca n't be happening to me .
it 's a plan -- -- _ 51 .
you lost your head , it happens . i 'm so fuckin jazzed ! listen . i 'm going to have to fly to chicago tomorrow , how 'bout if we meet in the dallas airport and we all fly into new york together for the draft ?
well , no you did n't --
do n't worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either --
i know . sorry i threw a scare into our lives there --
let 's go . i 'll drive you . _ 45 .
now .
i 'm sorry . i was on a roll . i meant something else . when do you want to leave ?
who said anything about `` loser ? '' where do you get this word `` loser ? ''
you are not a loser .
okay , this is working .
king of the housecalls ! master of the living room !
that 's right .
well , it worked , and i will not let you fail . you are jerry ma- fuckin-guire .
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time .
good . they 're all heatseekers ! all of them , everybody . you keep one superstar and they 'll all follow . there 's no real loyalty , and the first person who told me that , jerry maguire , was you .
seventy-two clients . one stayed . jacket on , tie in pocket . _ 44 .
ugh !
`` dad says we gwan sleep on it .
and the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket . tell me again , how was it left with cush ?
the power move is to go unannounced . black suit , right ?
one of the accountants .
who told you ?
i know about the bachelor party .
oh -- do n't forget tomorrow we have dinner with wade cooksey .
jerry , this is what intimacy is !
you know . i do n't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything !
oh gawd , oh yes , it 's never been better . never better ! !
sooner ... or later ... i 'll have to stop .
do n't ever stop fucking me !
still going .
yeah , how 'd it go with sportboy ?
he 's asleep , right ?
good , that 'll put him to sleep early . no offense .
hey , man , tonight i 'm going to teach ray about jazz .
do n't let him stay up too late .
yeah , dotty . you did . _ 50 .
wait . did i just say `` hon '' to him ?
talking and saying nothing , man , it 's an art i have not mastered .
just be friendly and say `` no comment . ''
reporters , jerry . they been callin ' all night .
`` something in the way . yeah . ''
okay . san diego just came in with a last-minute scenario . it 's big .
`` it 's okay to eat fish , 'cause they do n't have any feelings ...
cush , matt -- we have a decision to make .
wait . what do you mean ?
i see what you 're saying .
let me think about that . want something to drink ?
then you should n't have begged me to hire him .
airight . enough . i 'm pulling him out of this . this is n't what i had in mind anyway .
bill , rod , wait --
look , rod , just get on the camel !
they ai n't laughing , man . something 's wrong .
... this is ... uh ... too funny ...
you 're imagining it .
this is fuckin michael jordan , man ! they should be screaming .
oh come on --
you hear those courtesy laughs , jerry ? there is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party .
aw , shut up . you had me at hello . _ 130 .
this used to be my specialty . i was good in a living room . send me in there , i 'll do it alone . and now i just ... i do n't know ... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life , it was n't complete , was n't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete , because i could n't share it with you . i could n't hear your voice , or laugh about it with you . i missed my wife . we live in a cynical world , and we work in a business of tough competitors , so try not to laugh -- i love you . you complete me .
come on , jerry . you know this is n't easy for me . _ 118 .
so this break ... is a break-up .
there 's no question you 'll be friends . of course you 'll be friends .
what about ray ?
oh please . my need to make the best of things , and your need to be what , `` responsible '' ... if one of us does n't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it . why do n't we call this next road trip what it is . a nice long break .
i do n't like to give up .
i know . i watched it . i sort of know it by heart .
what if it 's true ? `` great at friendship bad at intimacy . '' i mean , come on . it 's the theme of my bachelor film --
i think we made a mistake here .
dorothy -- what if i 'm just not built that way ?
why fucking not ! i deserve it .
... my soul or something . _ 117 .
i do n't know --
you want ...
i do n't need you to `` stick . ''
well -- i 'm not the guy who 's going to run . i stick .
i took advantage of you and worst of all , i 'm not alone . i did this with a kid . i was just on some ride where i thought i was in 1ove enough for both of us . i did this . and at least i can do something about it now .
tell me -- let me help --
it 's not fair to you . this whole --
what --
it 's my fault .
why do you love me ?
why do you love me ?
okay ... i will ...
well , when you wonder , ask me .
and i really do n't know your noises yet .
sometimes i ca n't tell at all , what 's going through that head of yours .
i was thinking i hope he does n't get injured . i felt responsible .
will you marry me ?
no no . do n't do that . do n't say that if you do n't ...
if i said that , would you stay ?
look , just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes ... whatever ... do n't make a joke of your life . go back and read what you wrote . you 're better than the rest of them , better than the bob sugars , and do n't forget it .
what --
so i 'll see you this weekend .
this rig ? phht . no problem .
sure you 're okay to drive this ?
and i appreciate that impulse .
fine , i just --
another time , okay dorothy ?
easy , easy --
oh god .
oh hell yes .
okay . wait here a second . do we really want to do this ?
right . i 'll come in .
no . i have to go in . i live here .
same to you .
i think you should not come in , or come in depending on how you feel .
good night .
well -- this would be goodnight .
let 's not tell our sad stories .
what ?
yeah . it was n't like my marriage to roger was so great , even before -- jerry ?
no no no . i just underestimated her ... her temper , i guess . why are we even talking about this ?
maybe you should call her .
maybe love should n't be such hard work . i know , but --
it was laziness1 my whole breakup with avery . you know that thing you say , `` it 's nobody 's fault . '' it 's one of the great lies , right ? someone is always to blame -- if you go for it , go for it like you do a job , work at it --
bye you guys . _ 88 .
we 'll see you soon , honey . bye .
yeah , i did -- am i dressed okay ? i guess i did n't realize we were ...
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster . you meet chad the nanny ?
wow . that 's more than a dress . that 's an audrey hepburn movie .
exactly because i know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts . _ 86 .
you walked out on a job for me , and i wo n't ruin that .
oh good .
i mean , the other night was ... i felt like you understood something i could barely even say , something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about . i wo n't ever take advantage of you in that way again .
i 'm relieved you said that .
we 're two people working together and we ca n't have an atmosphere .
yeah , what happened there .
look , the other night , i want to apologize .
you do n't have to explain .
i sunk most of what i had into this condo , which devalued , and --
plus , you could use that commission .
good . good . glad is good .
actually he said `` glad . '' _ 85 .
happy . he said `` happy ? ''
dennis wilburn called from arizona to say he 's faxing in the new tidwell offer on thursday morning , and you 'll be happy .
good evening .
well , good evening .
i may not sue .
no , i do . i feel like clarence thomas . i 'm like ... harrassing you ... right now .
no . no do n't feel like clarence thomas .
now i feel like clarence thomas .
yeah , i did .
oh shit . you said `` boss . ''
do n't worry about it , boss .
sorry about this hand . you know that feeling -- you 're not completely embarrassed yet , but you glimpe tomorrow 's embarrassment ?
well .
mission ... statement ...
i 'm working with you because of that memo ...
what you wrote inspired me . _ 79 .
me too .
sure .
truth ?
and i am ...
-- especially one like this .
we will be fine !
do n't worry about me . i can get jobs --
good idea . thank you .
drinks . food . plus , i called you a cab .
yeah , thanks .
beer okay ?
sure --
do you have something to drink ?
sorry . uh , let me see , have a seat . i 'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too .
and just think if i got her the ring she really wanted .
jesus , it 's a real gash , is n't it ?
better now than later . we 'll still be friends . i 'm dying here .
too bad .
yeah . that too . i broke up with avery .
oh my god .
i 'm glad you 're home . that `` alone '' thing is ... not my specialty ...
he 's asleep . watch out for that lamp .
thanks for inviting me over . where 's the little guy ?
hi .
hey you .
yep . have a good time at school , ray . wish me luck .
okay , have we gone over everything ? back on tuesday , right ?
call me later , hon .
thanks .
happy for us ... okay . here 's the number . 404-453-2222 .
happy for us .
well , i 'm happy for you .
it 's all going to work . we 're going to save the world .
i just got goosebumps .
it 's all going to work .
we are ?
dorothy , let me tell you something , we are back . we are so very very back . i re-signed cush . we 're set .
shit , it 's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to avery --
... light .
wait . that 's yesterday , from the other office . today is ...
no , that 's fine . what calls came in today ?
sorry , that 's my son and the nanny . i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff .
hello ?
honey -- later , okay ? whoop . wait .
same to you .
that took guts .
absolutely .
but i mean really ... wonderfully ... great .
no no , i know --
give me your number . i 'll call tomorrow . i 'm just a little . i 'm a little insane right now . but it 's going to be great .
and i guess we did n't talk about money . so , i 'll just dive in --
sure . yes . medical , i do n't know .
so i know this is a bad time , but -- you will have a medical program , right ?
my favorite aunt is hearing impaired . he said `` you complete me . '' _ 40 .
wonder what he said .
dorothy . ray . a pleasure .
oh no . i 'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach , taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic , and your life flashes before your eyes , but -- hey , i 've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here 's my sister laurel to pick us up . thanks , though . bye .
-- the part about `` we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm '' --
i appreciate that , because some of that stuff ... you know , it was two in the morning and ...
oh tsht . yes .
you think so ?
i think in this age , optimism like that ... it 's a revolutionary act .
no , i 'm just ... anxiously looking past it . i already had my bachelor party . it was called `` my twenties . '' see you later .
nnnnn . i just killed the surprise .
no no . i knew .
oh no .
and have fun at your bachelor party .
well , take care .
well , thanks .
my son ... my mind ...
now what did you lose ?
hmm . pretty good .
i know who y6u are . you 're dorothy boyd . you 're in ... wait ... you 're in accounts . you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal 's body .
oh . hi . i work in your office . i was on the junket to the conference . i 'm --
can i help ?
oh , tell the story .
no no ...
oh , well , why did n't you say so ? and oh , i do n't know if you 're interested in this detail , but i was just about to tell you that i love him . i love him , and i do n't care what you think . i love him for the guy he wants to be , and i love him for the guy he almost is . i love him .
easy , hon , i was just looking for fun details --
guys are just different people when they 're hanging onto the bottom rung .
please , if i start talking --
because i 'm worried that you 're putting your faith in this guy who , because of the way things are going , may not have an emotional marble in his head .
no --
first you got ta tell me something .
oh , knock it off ! _ 89 .
no no . do n't cry at the beginning of the date .
that 's the first time i ever saw him kiss a man , like a dad , was n't that just ... thrilling ? i mean , he must have been needing that .
forgot your keys --
thanks .
good .
i 've got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger , for the rest of my life . i have had three lovers in four years , all boring , all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours i might add , and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath . look at me , laurel , look at me . i 'm the oldest 26 year old in the world ! how do i look ?
as opposed to twenty angry women ?
but you just got ta hear me out on one thing . you 're very responsible with ray and you know it 's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man 's voice in the house .
that 's the girl i love .
look , here 's some of that chicken with salsa too , i warmed it up -- _ 74 .
thank you .
this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest . wait . use the frosted glasses .
no kidding . i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen .
i heard .
honey , he 's engaged . and for the first time in my professional life , i 'm a part of something i believe in .
dotty -- this is not `` guy. '' . this is a `` syndrome . '' it 's called early midlife , about-to-marry , hanging onto the-bottom-rung dear- god-don't-let-me-be-alone , i'll- call-my-newly long-suffering- assistant-without medical-for- company syndrome . and if , knowing all that , you still allow him to come over , more power to you .
he just lost his best client . he called from the plane . i invited the guy over .
at eleven at night ? _ 70 .
he 's coming over .
he 's in the living room asleep .
wait . where is he ?
of course i know --
you know how much those well child exams cost --
if you 'd read what he wrote , you would have left with him too .
you are a single mother . you have given up the right to be frivolous .
of course , medical ! _ 42 .
what about medical ?
and i love my fans , of which he is one . wan na thank them for all my sundays , and of course my monday nights too . that about says it ...
ten seconds , rod .
oh yes . jerry maguire ! my agent ! this is a fierce , loving individual , i love this man , he is love , he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan .
it 's only a half-hour show , rod .
i ... i love everybody , man . i love my wife . my kids . little tyson . my new baby kaydee . my brother tee pee . i love my friends , my teammates , who am i leaving out ?
-- well , rod , your agent passed me a note before the show . he says that your deal memo has been signed by the arizona cardinals . four years for ten-point-two million dollars . playing in the state where you grew up .
no , roy . i 'm not gon na cry .
we signed an hour ago . you were in the lobby with the black fella .
now . wait . you did n't actually sign with sugar , did you ? tell me you did n't sign . because i 'm still sort of moved by your `` my word is stronger'n oak '' thing --
i brought denver to twenty million . denver deals with me all the time . you listened to sugar ? you let that snake in the door .
i 'm sorry , i --
so you empowered bob sugar to deal with denver behind my back ?
hey , i 'm learning as i go .
said who ? sugar ?
apparently , denver wanted to deal with him instead of you .
do i know everything there is to know here ? you fellas are n't talking with bob sugar , are you ?
not right now , jerry .
denver got very silent about a day ago . san diego 's got a fever for cush . this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft . people get crazy . and san diego , you should know , is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty . signing bonus of eight . million .
what happened to denver ?
you know i do n't do `` contracts . '' but'cha do have my word , and it 's stronger than oak .
i 'll give it everything .
denver is where he should be .
it 's either going to be denver or san diego trading up to take him .
i want him to go number one in the draft , and i want him to play .
you know , i 'm not a hugger and yet ... i ca n't let go .
told myself -- if he shows up , we 'll stick with him .
oh , thank you .
we decided to stay with you .
matt , i came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to smi . but to me --
i missed ya . what can i say ?
thanks for coming .
go . flee .
jerry ! you made it --
only 'cause my wife likes your wife !
we still having dinner in l.a. ?
beautiful .
fine .
i do n't want to be friends anymore .
airight . here 's why you do n't have your ten million dollars yet . you are a paycheck player . you play with your head . not your heart . in your personal life ? heart . but when you get on the field -- _ 113 .
i think so .
well , friends can tell each other anything , right ? if we have our `` friends '' hats on --
why not --
look . i 'm happy to entertain you , as always , but i have a question for you . are we really `` friends ? ''
for loyalty , you buy a dog . for love , you get married .
damn right .
that 's an answer .
no , i 'm going to answer you . you want an answer ? i 'll give it to you . loyalty . she was loyal . everything grew from there .
i 'm sorry i asked .
you 're jabbing at me . _ 112 .
then why 'd you get married ? i 'm asking you as a friend .
not everyone has what you have .
i 'm trying to talk to you . how 's your marriage ?
no , you 're --
i 'm asking you a question --
why are you doing this to me , rod ?
you do n't want to go home , do you ?
i do n't know -- how 's `` dedication '' for an answer ?
why are you even here , man ? you could have told me all this over the phone .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
do n't i know . now go home to your wife .
take care , okay ? you 're my entire client roster .
i 'm gon na have the game of my life on monday night football , and show all these motherfuckers .
hey , that 's my word , okay ?
well , just stay healthy . i will show you the kwan .
no .
we can still take the offer , rod .
i 'm worried too . i 'm worried that the only reason i 'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you were n't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago .
i 'm a little worried --
tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair , signs an autograph and moves on . jerry alongside . the quarterback sucks , man . he 's gon na get me killed .
well , this was another way to go .
no .
you never had the talk , did you ?
shame on you . shame on you .
i did n't `` shoplift the pooty . '' we were thrown together and -- i mean it 's two mutual people who -- alright , i shoplifted the pooty .
no . a real man does not shoplift the `` pooty '' from a single mom .
the kid is amazing .
well , that ai n't fair to her . a single mother , that 's a sacred thing , man . _ 103 .
but i sure do n't like that she 's leaving .
then you got ta have the talk .
no , i do n't know .
you know when you know . it makes you shivver , it eats at your insides . you know ?
how do i know ?
first , single mothers do n't `` date . '' they have been to the circus , you know what i 'm saying ? they have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings . you love her ?
tell me , because it 's been a month , and she 's about to take another job in san diego .
oh i know plenty . i was raised by a single mother .
what do you know about dating a single mother ?
oh , we gon na be friends now ?
can i ask you a question totally unrelated to your career ?
rod , get on the camel .
dude , know your art form . if you put the camera down here , looking up , i look more powerful . there 's no need for a camel ... you got me .
good deal , man .
i 'll get you some quick work --
it 's a risk .
wo n't happen . i 'm strong in my mind .
if you get injured , you get nothing .
you 're hanging by a very thin thread , dude . and i dig that about you .
i 'm out here for you ! you do n't know what it 's like to be me out here for you . it is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that i will never fully tell you about ! okay ? ! help me help you help me help you .
no tell me . _ 84 .
forget it . forget it .
what 's wrong .
fine .
do your job , man , do n't tell me to dance .
rod , i 'm not a rascist . i 'm telling you to be the best version of you , to get back to the guy who first started playing this game . way back when you were a kid . it was n't just about the money , was it ?
`` love me love me love me ... put me on t.v . '' that 's the iconography of rascism , man !
no , i 'm saying to be --
you 're telling me to dance .
you .
is that your porty or mine ?
rod , i say this with great respect , but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
no , i air-dry .
great word . towel ?
i got there from `` coin , '' dude . coin , coin ... kwaaaan .
but how did you get `` kwan ? '' _ 82 .
yeah , man , it means love , respect , community ... and the dollars too . the package . the kwan .
that 's your word ?
-- the kwan .
maybe you do n't . because it 's not just the money i deserve . it 's not just the `` coin . '' it 's the ...
i understand your anxiety .
john taylor . j.j. stokes . andre rison . i smoke all these fools , and yet they 're making the big sweet dollars . they 're making the money , and i got an agent that ai n't even put the number on the table .
uh , not today , but --
did you tell him about the `` ten million for four years ? ''
oh my god .
anybody else would have left you by now , but i 'm sticking with you . i said i would . and if i got to ride your ass like zorro , you 're gon na show me the money .
another drink please .
man , i got a shelf life of ten years , tops ! my next contract 's got ta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time . i 'm out of this sport in five years . what 's my family gon na live on ? what you get me . so i do n't want to hear about ya shit , your `` nya nya nya . ''
why not ?
you are not allowed to act this way .
it 's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime . _ 69 .
no .
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
well , boo-fucking-hoo .
see this jacket i 'm wearing ? you like it ? i do n't really need it , because i 'm cloaked in failure . i lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft . they will teach my story to other agents on `` do not do this '' day in agent school . why ? let 's recap . because a hockey player 's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk , i had two slices of bad pizza , went to bed , grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page manifesto of doom !
do n't you even see -- i 'm finished . i 'm fucked . twenty-four hours ago , i was hot . now ... i 'm a cautionary tale !
huh ?
what are you doing with me , rod ?
you feel bad you tested positive ? quit doing blow ! you feel bad about your baby girl ? why did you leave the mother ?
rod --
very much .
you love me now , do n't you ?
i might call you later !
call me tomorrow .
sure you do n't want to go out and find some karoake ? i 'm a very good singer , man --
get some sleep . see you tomorrow .
good . i was just testing ya . but just you saying that ? makes me love ya .
i 'm not about love -- i 'm about `` showing you the money . ''
you 're loving me now , are n't ya ?
okay , i understand . i 'll boil it down for ya . fuck nike . all they do is ignore me ...
i got ta get back to cushman .
you believe they 're shooting a nike ad down there ? did i ever tell you my nike story ?
let 's do it again .
yeah . and it might have even worked too .
i came all the way here for that ? to walk the lobby ?
why the fuck am i here ? i feel like i 'm five years late for the prom .
at last i find you .
congratulations . you 're still my agent .
show . me . the . money .
now does n't that just make you feel good to say it ? say it with me .
i got it .
here it is . `` show me the money . '' show . me . the . money . _ 36 .
yes .
it 's a very personal , very important thing . it 's a family motto . so i want to share it with you . you ready ?
mmm . hmm .
-- now to recap , i want to stay in arizona , i want my new contract , i like you , you 're nice to my wife , i will stay with you , that 's what i 'm doing for you , but here 's what you 're gon na do for me . you listening ?
exactly . and i 'm sitting here with an ant problem , look ! and my brother tee pee 's room is flooded with water . say hello to jerry maguire --
now you want arizona dollars .
good , 'cause see , i am a valuable commodity . i go across the middle . i see the ball and a dude coming right at me , wanting to kill me , i tell my brain `` get killed , catch the ball . '' that 's new york steak , baby . rare . and yet , nobody 's giving me love . nobody 's giving me props . nobody . i went to arizona state , i 'm from arizona , i break arizona records , i 'm a sun devil , man ! ! !
okay .
alright , we 're just getting started on my list of things you need to know . take notes if you want to .
jerry . you two will be together forever .
which they do . and we 're standing there . all the football guys are in the lobby , watching , there 's even an espn crew . so i turn to her and sort of grandly say , `` well , this is me , klutz , asking you , goddess of rock climbing , to marry me . '' and i took out the ring , and i do n't much like big scenes , but she said `` yes '' right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies . we 're getting married in february .
but wait ...
how sad --
well , it bothered me somewhat . and i got quiet . and now she 's quiet and we 're both pouting a little , you know . and i decide i 'm not going to propose . the mood is not right . why be impulsive ? now at this point i know she knows that i was going to propose and did n't . and she knows i know . so the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport , we do n't speak . and we 're both good at that . we fly to honolulu in silence . we check into the pro bowl hotel --
oh no -- _ 14 .
to the pools . now she 's miss rock climber , and i 'm more the non-rock climber , but we 're hiking up through the pools and there 's a fine mist in the air , and i have the ring in my pocket , and i 'm a little nervous , i 'm lagging behind , and she says to me , get this -- `` hurry up , klutz . ''
to the pools ?
exactly . and the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor . i knew i wanted to propose , so i took her there .
that 's when you need to cement , and define define define .
a year-and-a-half later , we were both in hawaii for the pro bowl . now i 've always hit a wall at 18 months . every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months . it 's like -- ka- boom . the curse of 18 months .
gorgeous .
-- so our first date , she told me about her favorite place in the world , the seven pools of hana on the island of maui ...
oh , tell the story .
she 's an nfl publicist ... amazing sense of style ... former athlete ... volleyball ... world class ... really knows how to live every moment of her life , which is why i should take a nap now ...
tell me , and then you can sleep .
i uh ... do n't think we 're quite at your pitch yet .
it 's the death rattle of my singlehood , right ? because i finally see the white picket fence looming and i love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it ... you 're right , i 'll know when i see him . why is it so easy to talk with you ? ! tell me about your fiancee .
i think you 'll know when you see him at the gate .
and i ca n't say his name without laughing i want to eat him up . i want to say goodbye to every bad thought i ever had about relationships . i mean , i crave this guy ... and yet ... why ... why did i have that affair this weekend ? does that mean i 'm not in love with my boyfriend ?
well . good luck with that --
bobbi fallon . bpi . i 'm producing the coke commercials for the playoffs .
jerry maguire . smi .
you 're with the sports people on the plane , right ?
where 'd you find the perfect white shirt ?
what --
i have to ask .
alright , i 'm freaking too . but they need you to stay calm . i 'll call back . _ 124 .
`` stay calm ? '' i 'm freakin ...
keep the phone open . i 'll call back . stay calm . he 's got some good doctors out there .
i 'm freakin out . oh god i 'm --
he took a shot . he 's unconscious .
my husband believes in you . we 're gon na make it . bye bye dorothy .
do n't be silly .
i 'm sorry what i said back there .
what do you stand for ? ? ?
marcee --
what are you talking about -- `` do n't get emotional . '' if you ask me , you have n't gotten emotional enough about this man . _ 98 .
okay , we do n't take this emotionally . we roll with this problem .
and say what ? `` please remove your dick from my ass ? ! ''
i 'll go back to them .
damn right .
damn right , and you can start by taking rod 's poster and putting it where people can see it !
marcee , things are changing around here . you and rod will have my total personal attention .
not a chance .
you gon na get that --
i know you say to take the arizona offer , but my husband needs more recognition . _ 25 .
how can i make your life better ?
jerry , rod is very very upset . tyson , no !
marcee . how 's my favorite player 's wife ?
i 've got the clients . i 've got the juice .
smi represents all three quarterbacks on your team , where 's their loyalty going to be ? you stay with me , i 'd fight for you alone . you 'd be my only client on that team ...
you 'll always be my hero , jerry . always always always . we 're bringing other elements in , we 're focusing on endorsements -- it 's not about handholding anymore . we 're no longer babysitters --
-- and i 'll get 'em .
jerry --
i 'm over it . now i want all my clients and yours too .
you wanted smaller .
you 'll lose .
give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face ! what i went through knowing i was going to do this to my mentor ! can you get past yourself for a second ?
dick .
... dick ?
you did this to yourself . you said `` fewer clients . '' you put it all on paper . scully was very upset . heart attacks make some people sweeter , but not him . you did this to yourself --
you ...
i know . it sucks . i suck .
aw shit ... the crowded restaurant ... so there 's no scene ...
came here to fire you , jerry .
pardon me ?
i came here to let you go . _ 27 .
i 'm fine . what 's up ?
you okay ?
gim me a second here ... tidwell ... arizona contract ... new glass cabinet ...
pleasure .
marcee -- this is one of our agents . this is bob sugar , who needs to learn to knock .
cronin 's okay for lunch ?
the best commercial director in the business . i hail you .
dooler , you know bob sugar .
it 's in a cage . do not be scared of ...
i 'm scared . what is it ?
-- i give you my favorite animal in the zoo . are you ready for the weirdness , the strange perfection and truth of ...
right up ahead , buddy --
show me the animal , jerry !
a lot . we got a big fax today ... we need this commission , buddy .
what 's going on , jerry ?
funny ... i better go to bed .
funny .
i do n't see any .
we 'll go to the zoo sometime . okay ? i think i might have some time on my hands .
i wo n't tell .
yeah i know . i did .
you said `` fuck '' .
aw , the fucking thing ... i mean , the zoo is closed .
let 's go right now . let 's go to the zoo .
okay . i 've been hogging it . you 're right . _ 76 .
let 's go the zoo .
wait . i want to tell you more about my dad .
and then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and i love the zoo . do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo ?
hi ray .
hi .
i 'm not your brother !
they do , my brother .
no .
hey , man , you know they have big balloons built into cars ?
thanks . may i offer you both a ride ?
one-two-three , swing .
i 'm not putting him down , i just have a commitment to the truth .
shut up ! ! !
he should have kept his head tucked down .
what 'd i say ?
can you be quiet ?
he 's gon na have nothing left for next season . they 're letting him kill himself .
that 's why they cheer , you know . the white man sending the black man into battle ...
now go kiss your daddy , quick .
a bird cage .
what is it ?
oh , my god .
one way to find out .
do you think it goes all the way across ?
this is how you play god .
this is how you make dinosaurs ?
quiet !
eric !
he 's smart , dr. grant . and he knows so much about dinosaurs .
after what you 've seen today , you really think your son could be alive ?
a few of us survived . a lot more died . and we were better prepared and better armed . how many days have they been missing ?
still , you have survived the dinosaurs before . you saved those kids .
and tell your wife to stop making so much noise ! we 're food to these damn animals .
errr-iiic !
i would completely support that .
either that , or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age .
i do . it 's worth another shot . and who knows ? things might turn out differently .
you mean it ?
we should try fishing again .
but he did n't . and neither did you . and i 'm glad about that .
he could have died .
how would you have helped eric ? he needs you , paul . he needs us .
i should have tried . it should have been me on that beach back there , not billy .
you could n't have made that jump .
my own kid was right in front of me and i did n't do a damn thing .
i 'm trying ! that thing took him down this way !
paul ! where is he ? can you see him ?
we 're not going anywhere , i promise .
eric , its okay . you 'll be right behind me .
never had a doubt . never did . us kirby men , we stick around , huh ?
sweetheart , you 're okay . you 're okay . you 're okay .
i loaned it to nash . he must have had it on him when he ...
what ? ... what ! ?
think .
i do n't remember
when did you have it last ?
i do n't know . i do n't have it with me .
he would have been , safe . completely , entirely , suffocatingly safe . i would have him to see more of the world than enid , oklahoma . i wanted to see more of the world than enid , oklahoma . and so yes , it 's my fault that this happened . i 'm sorry that you have to be here .
that one time was just the bumper .
this would n't happen if he was with you . i mean , you drive five miles below the speed limit . i totaled three cars in fives years .
well damn it . i do n't speak ill of the dead . what i 'm trying to say is , its was just a crazy accident . the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me . you ca n't go beating yourself up about it .
well what ?
i want to find them too , but we ca n't do a bit of good right now . for every scary thing we saw in the daylight , i 'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night . am i right ?
we ca n't just stop looking . eric and dr. grant are out there somewhere .
we have to help him .
it 's not safe .
he 's this way .
udesky .
eric !
eric ! are you here ?
its not about him . it 's eric . he 's alone out here somewhere . our baby is all alone .
i know you liked ben . i had no right to ...
no , it 's ...
i 'm sorry amanda . i am . and i 'm sorry for the things i said about him .
i filmed this the morning they left .
that 's him . thats eric !
eric ...
young adult .
just drop it paul !
what did you say !
nothing .
what did you say ?
nothing .
what ?
oh , do n't worry about that .
fine ... and when the tricyclatops comes after you , do n't come crying to me .
because `` dr. grant '' is n't looking for eric . dr. grant is looking for the coast .
well what 's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him ?
dr. grant says this , dr. grant says that ...
no , dr. grant says ...
well we should split up or something . we can cover twice the area .
stop that . dr. grant says this is dangerous territory .
so do you .
you look good .
people change .
you hate to swim .
twenty , twenty-fire pounds . i 've been swimming at the y .
how much weight have you lost ?
nothing you have n't seen before .
sorry .
we called everyone , did everything we could . because of all the controversy over this island , no one will step in . costa rica says it 's a no-fly zone , it 's their own damn fault . guys at the u.s embassy -- our u.s. embassy -- said we should `` accept the inevitable . '' you believe that ?
a friend . we were vacationing . eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs , so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing . they never came back .
her new boyfriend .
do n't worry , honey . we 'll circle around and come back .
we ca n't just ...
what 's a bad idea ?
he says it 's a bad idea !
what ?
amanda , honey ! dr. grant says it 's a bad idea !
from what i understand , it 's pretty much whatever we want .
well , i 'm no aviation specialist . but i do know it 's hell of a lot lower than anyone else .
we 've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna . and we want you to be our guide .
... once-in-a-lifetime .
we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight .
amanda and i , well , we just love the outdoors . heck we 've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with : galapagos , k2 , the nile ...
it is truly , whats the word ? inspiring .
first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts , amanda and i have admired your work for years .
where is it ?
you had the phone the whole time ?
what about eric ?
going to the coast was alan 's idea . if he 's alive , thats where he 's headed .
what about eric and dr. grant ?
we need to stick to the plan . head for the coast .
he 's not a kill , he 's still alive .
he 's right . a predator would n't leave a kill wounded .
here !
i thought we were n't suppose to yell .
who 's that ?
he 's with a man named ben hildebrand .
how low ?
you see , that 's just the thing . paul and i have special permission to fly low .
okay . he loves us very very much . and i know that right now more than anything , your dad would want to know that we 're safe . okay ?
he loves you too .
let me tell you a few things about you dad , okay ? he 's very very very clever , very very brave , and he loves you ever very much .
then we should ...
i know . i know . i want to look for him too .
we have to keep looking for dad . we have to .
just hold on .
where 's dad ?
dad !
paul !
it wo n't hold !
eric !
sure .
he 's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is . figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island . right ?
dr. grant was .
i thought you were an expert .
i dont know .
they set a trap they actually set a trap .
they couldnt climb up , so they were trying to get us to come down .
about a thousand feet above it , actually . most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were .
thirty-thousand , i think . closer to the top .
so mr. kirby , tell me , when you climbed k2 , did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet ?
i did n't know , there were two islands .
that was isla nublar . this is isla sorna . the second island .
i know the consequences !
no !
i can get him !
some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions . you rushed in with no thought to the consequences , to yourself or anyone else . you 're no better than the people who built this place .
you have to believe me . i did it with the best intentions .
billy , i ca n't talk to you now .
alan , i want to tell you that i 'm so sorry about the ...
we need to keep moving .
keep going !
alan !
ah yes , the first rule of academics . publish or perish .
we could co-write a paper .
we should take it with us to signal any planes .
it looks intact .
that 's because it was n't on their list . who knows what else they were up to ?
i do n't remember that on ingen 's list .
not with that sail . spinosaurus aegypticus .
baryonyx ?
they never got that big .
obviously a superpredator . suchimimus . that snout .
how would you classify it ?
i do n't think so .
is it a rex ?
mr. and mrs. kirby ! if you look out the right you can see ...
i 'm so use to seeing bones . it 's weird to see skin .
the bones will be there when we get back . that 's the nice thing about them . they never run away . and besides , you got me into this . i do n't intend to be alone with these people .
listen alan , i really appreciate you bringing me along .
reverse-darwinism . survival of the most idiotic .
it was this strap alone that saved my life . got caught on a rock as i was falling .
that does sound lucky .
no way . this is lucky . couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand . updraft sent me right into the side . boom !
even with what i pay you , you could get a better bag .
what ?
they 're here .
absolutely not .
not if it ca n't dig .
it 's a rapid prototyper . i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull , than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints , one layer on top of the other . it 's the future of paleontology .
you rented an automated litter box .
three weeks . i had to rent some equipment .
we 'll be broke in four weeks .
how was your trip ? profitable ?
alan do n't be afraid to evolve .
a well-accepted theory .
when i met you , i thought that one day millions of years ago , all the dinosaurs became extinct . wiped out . but you told me otherwise . when conditions changed , dinosaurs changed . they became other things . they evolved .
goodbye , alan .
okay . goodbye , ellie .
let me know if i can help , alan . youre bad about asking for help , but please ask me . anything , anytime .
i 'd better get going .
the last of my breed .
times change alan . but you 're the still the best . i mean that .
it was never easy , but before jurassic park , you could find money . somewhere . now fossils are out . everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur .
good luck with the fund raising .
to a degree we never imagined .
you think they could talk to each other ?
we 've done cranial scans , and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber . i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence . the way they can work together as a team .
i try not to .
you remember the sounds they made ?
my favorite .
raptors , mostly .
anything good ?
really ? what do you do there ?
so , mark 's working at the state department now .
sorry , alan it 's been six years .
he used to know me .
he 's three . why do n't you wait till he 's a little older ?
hmm ?
the population will stabilize eventually . they 'll adapt to fit different roles .
what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs ?
no we 're not .
we 're safe !
do me a favor . go back to your parents for a minute , would you ? they look worried .
no . i could n't see .
eric , do you know what happened to the boat ? that brought you here ? why did it crash ?
you 're right .
you should .
it 's strikes me now i never told her that .
she 's the one person i could always count on . and she 's saved me more times than she realizes . i owe her everything .
the lady you called , how do you know she can help us ?
something must 've scared them .
bonitas .
exactly . the difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are . to be able to touch them . that 's what billy wanted to do .
but then you never get to go in space .
see , i was the opposite . i never understood why anyone would want to go into space . it 's so dangerous . you do one thing wrong and you 're dead . the astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety . and truthfully , everything you really need to learn , you can learn it from the ground .
i want to be an astronaut .
i have a theory that there 's two kinds of boys . those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts .
no . although i 've studied them in the wild .
do you have any kids ?
then we go home ?
we climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean . with any luck , the costa rican coast guard will pick us up .
closer you get to the water , the bigger things get .
why ?
are you sure ?
we need to head for the coast .
i stayed pretty close to the compound , figured if anyone came to look for me , that 's where they 'd start .
how much of this island have you explored ?
mine 's new .
a raptor claw . i use to have one . a fossil .
know what this is ?
i dunno . i mean , it was kind of preachy . chaos-this , chaos-that . and like , to me , the guy seemed kind of high on himself .
what did you think ?
yeah .
did you read malcolm 's book ?
the important thing is we both made it . that 's something we have in common .
is that all it 's been ? i thought it was longer .
it 's a wonder you are n't . i 'm amazed , eric . i barely lasted 30 hours . you lasted eight weeks .
found this , but the battery 's dead .
any weapons , radios ?
when ingen cleared out , they left a lot of stuff behind .
back then , they had n't tried to eat me .
the first one . before you where on the island . you liked dinosaurs back then .
which one do you prefer ?
you 're alan grant , are n't you ? i read both of your books .
you 'd be surprised what people can do when they have too .
they 'll never make it . i mean , they ca n't manage when the cable goes out .
on the island .
in costa rica ?
eric , your parents are both here .
stan .
well , we do n't exactly have a costa rican phone book here , so it will have to be somebody we know in the states . someone we can absolutely count on to send help .
whatever you do , do n't call the u.s. embassy . they wo n't do a god damn thing .
it 's no use , dr. grant . no use .
billy !
back out ! move !
amanda !
but you never came across just one .
well that 's good .
there is . i own a place called kirby paint and title plus . we 're out in the westgate shopping center in enid , oklahoma . the `` plus '' is for bathroom fixtures , fireplaces accessories , patio furniture . stuff like that .
there is no kirby enterprises , is there ?
you can stick with us , or you can go and look for him . either way you 're probably not getting out of here alive .
dr. grant , we 're not leaving without our son .
no , i 'm sorry , but no . we 'll savage what we can from the plane . then we head for the coast . there may be a boat left , something to get us off this island .
sure you have . you wrote that book ...
i have never been on this island !
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land . somebody who 'd been to this island before .
mr. kirby , trust me , on this island , there is no such thing as safe . we have to get back in this plane ...
establishing a perimeter . making it safe . these guys are really good . one of them was a green ...
what the hell is going on ? what are they doing ?
this plane can not land !
dr. grant if you 'd just sit tight , we 'll explain this all in a jiffy .
let 's just say that through my business -- imports/exports , emerging markets -- i 've made some friends in high places . in this case , the costa rican government .
that 's hard to believe .
i 'm flattered , but i 've taken this little adventure tour . and with the air restrictions they 've imposed after the incident in san diego , you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest .
no , no , see dr. grant , you 're the best . you 've seen these animals in the flesh . no one else has come close to you .
that 's a very nice offer , mr. kirby , but i 'm afraid i 'm much to busy . if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified ...
now , for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special , something ...
hmmm .
i guarantee it 'll be worth your while .
you know , i 've been traveling and i 'm very tired . maybe some other time .
well sir , i am a great admirer of yours , and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss . would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight ? our treat .
what can i do for you , mr. kirby ?
no . i feel something .
you hear something ?
if the nest is upwind , so are we . when he comes back , he 'll know we 're here before we have a chance . the truck --
make a blind here ? wait for the buck to return ?
it certainly does .
it matches the pictures .
ajay . go on up to my ranch , take a look around the trophy room , and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me .
you broke that idiot 's jaw for no reason other than your boredom . tell the truth , roland . are n't you even interested in knowing this expedition 's quarry ?
sorry . we were saying ?
a true hunter does n't mind if the animal wins . if it escapes . but there were n't enough escapes from you and me , ajay . i 've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death . maybe i just feel too close to it my --
how do you mean ?
just a little bit too much , i think .
but alone ? we always had great success together , you and i .
well , i 'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch . you go .
i got a call from a gentleman who 's going to costa rica , or thereabouts . if he 's to be believed , it 's a most , uh , unique expedition . and very well-funded .
last time i plugged it in , i suppose . why ?
you . tell me , roland , when was the last time you answered your phone ?
that cheap aftershave i send you every christmas , you actually wear it . i 'm touched . sit down , sit down , what brings you to mombassa ?
how did you know ?
because i did n't know ! i do n't have the faintest idea what they 're doing here .
why did n't you tell us about these guys , ian ? !
like if you shoot yourself in the foot ? would n't matter . you 'd be dead before you realized you 'd accidentally pulled the trigger .
is there an antidote ?
is there anything we 've forgotten ? anything at all ?
it does n't matter what i think .
you think i 'm all talk , eddie ?
former academic . now i actually make things . i do n't just talk .
you are an academic .
light and strong , light and strong , sure , why not , it 's only impossible . god save me from academics .
`` minimal '' is too much . it has to be light , it has to be strong --
minimal .
any damage ?
ian , you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world . i ca n't walk so far and leave no footprints ; die and leave nothing with my name on it . i will not be known only for my failures . and you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic . you 're too smart . you'e too proud . dr. malcolm . please . this is a chance at redemption . for both of us . there 's no time to equivocate , we must seize it now , before --
i 'm not going , john .
you 'll need an animal behaviorist , someone with unimpeachable credentials . i believe you already know sarah harding . she 's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers i bet she 'd be dying to prove on a scale like this . if you convince her to go , it 'll be a major coup . when she publishes , the scientific community must take it seriously .
john . . .
i 've been putting this together for over a year . i have personal suggestions for your entire team , phone numbers , contact people . they wo n't believe you about what they 're going to see , so do n't bother trying to convince them . just use my checkbook to get them there . i 'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts , as such money and equipment as you need , but only if you leave immediately . if we hesitate , all will be lost .
so what ?
it would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen .
are you out of your mind ? i still have nightmares , my reputation 's a joke , my leg is shot -- you think i need more of that ?
after the accident at the park , a hurricane wiped out our facility on site b. we had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves . and they did . for four years i 've fought to keep them safe from human meddling , now i want you to go there and document them .
no , no , no , no , no , no . . .
isla nublar was just a showroom , ian , something for the tourists , site b was the factory floor . we built it first , on isla sorna , eight-some miles from nublar .
i do n't believe you .
the hatchery , in particular ? you know my initial yields had to be low , far less than one percent , that 's a thousand embryos for every single live birth . genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation , not the spotless little laboratory i showed you .
what are you talking about ?
well ? did n't it all seem a trifle compact to you ?
what ?
you were right -- and i was wrong . there ! did you ever think you 'd hear me say that ? spectacularly wrong . instead of observing those animals , i tried to control them . i squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives . not their lives as man would have them , behind electric fences , but in the wild . behavior in their natural habitat , the impossible dream of any paleontologist . i could have had it , but i let it slip away . thank god for site b .
they do have motives . why did you want to see me ? your message said it was urgent .
it 's the lawyers . the lawyers are finally killing me .
i did n't know you -- were n't well .
when you have a lot of time to think , it 's funny who you remember . it 's the people who challenged you . it is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning . i never told you how sorry i was about what happened after we returned .
resentful .
everyone , keep your voices down !
are you looking for a problem ?
you got ta be kidding . you dragged me out of greenpeace to be a corporate stooge ? you could n't get anybody else ?
but he 's the head of ingen !
is that who we 're really working for ? ! gene splicers ? !
ingen is a genetics corporation , is n't it ?
-humidity , i know . highest lead density on the market .
do you have chromium tapes ? the others fog in high-
-- my --
oh --
we 've got to see one to find out . is there any --
that does n't say a thing about t-rex , they could have been rogues . robert burke certainly thinks they were .
why would n't they ? look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds --
i 'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group , but there 's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did .
and let 's forget about the high hide . we ca n't do this kind of work up in a tower , we need to be out in the field , as close to the animals as possible .
dr. malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology .
ian , you 're not insane ! i 'm so glad !
not without a shot of the nest .
the empty shells are crushed and trampled . the young stay in the birth environment , that 's conclusive !
i want to see the nesting ground !
that was a pair bond ! a family group , even , long after that infant was nestbound !
come on !
dad !
i 'm fine ... i 'm fine ...
i 'm fine , i 'm fine , i was scared , i thought you , are you okay ? !
are you all right ? ! anything broken ?
exactly what john hammond wanted us to do .
what are you guys gon na do ?
on the side of that one truck .
where does it say that ?
`` ingen . '' what 's ingen ?
because you said so . maybe nobody else believed you , but i always did .
how could you possibly ?
you like to have kids , you just do n't want to be with them , do you ?
this is nothing like austin . forget about it .
i do n't care about the trials , i want to be with you . i could be your research assistant , like i was in austin .
out of the question . you 'd miss the gymnastics trials . you 've been training for that for a year .
i could come with you .
that richard .
no . richard talked to his parents .
well , is he ?
that was about a year ago .
you know , at the bus stop . with the hair ?
which one ?
is that kid still bothering you ?
no , dad . i have thoughts of my own once in a while .
very hurtful . your mother tell you to say that ?
i 'm your daughter all the time , you know . not just when it 's convenient .
i 'll make it up to you this summer . i promise .
my vacation is over in a week .
i ca n't tell you . but i 'll be back within a week .
stop saying fantastic . where are you going ?
well , i do , and she 's fantastic . she 'll take you to the museum , maybe to a movie if you play your cards right . you 're going to have a fantastic time .
i do n't even know this woman .
okay , karen is expecting you in half an hour . you only have to stay with her one night , she 'll put you on a bus in the morning and your mother will be at the station when you get there .
kelly ! what are you doing here ?
hi , dad .
let it go , peter . the animal won .
if i do n't move , i ca n't shoot it .
it 's just fed . it wo n't attack unless it 's threatened . do n't move .
it 's ... behind ... us .
why ?
we took to the rock .
possible .
do you think the rex might have the infant with it ?
good .
the radio rig is inside . it runs directly from the geothermal generator , so power should n't be a problem .
operations building . far end of the street .
where 's the power and radio setup ?
piss .
what is that ?
the velociraptors .
what is ?
is n't it obvious ?
what in christ 's name is going on ? !
we 've got to transport it seven thousand miles . would you prefer it bit off the leg of a crew member ?
you 've broken its leg !
had to . to keep him still for the trip .
i had n't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk , but i only thought of adults , it never occurred to me -- you are a billion dollar idea , my little f-
what ?
you 're kidding yourself . an adult t-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly . it acts the way people wish they could , that 's why everyone 's fascinated by it . if people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only , ninety-nine percent would --
rex wo n't be any different . it 'll come .
killing lessons ? heartwarming .
i once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep . all the jeep had done was startle the bull 's calves . i saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles , all the way back to its den , just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill .
you rally think this 'll draw the parent ?
why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill ?
forty yards . less , maybe . i assume it 'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down .
how close do you have to be ?
my father 's .600 nitro express . made in 1904. karimojo bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant . 8700 foot pound striking force .
what kind of gun is that ?
to collect my fee .
where do you think you 're going ? !
good lad .
okay .
peter , if you want me to run your little camping trip , there are two conditions . first -- i 'm in charge , and when i 'm not around , dieter is . your job is to sign the checks , tell us we 're doing a good job , and open your case of scotch when we have a good day . second condition -- my fee . you can keep it . all i want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs . a male . buck only . why and how are my business . if you do n't like either of those conditions , you 're on your own . go ahead and set up your camp right here , or in a swamp , or in the middle of a rex nest , for all i care . but i 've been on too many safaris with rich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas . okay ?
you heard his , dieter . find a new spot . and remember , we 're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks .
carnivores hunt near stream beds . do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar ?
what ? why ?
cancel that , dieter .
piss .
what 's he got in there ?
ingen is my livelihood , dr. malcolm , and i will jealously defend its interests . people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it .
it was a payoff and an insult . ingen never --
we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries .
there are no versions of the truth ! this is n't a corporate maneuver , it 's my life .
you version of it .
i did n't tell anything , i told the truth .
if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy , i hardly see how i am to --
you cost me my livelihood . that on which i relied to support my children .
you signed a non-disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw . you violated that agreement .
do me a favor . do n't pretend for a second that you and i do n't know the truth . you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want , but i was there .
so , you two were just , uh , telling old campfire stories , were you ?
i lost everything i came after on this trip , but one t-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail ingen out of chapter 11 .
you 're going too ?
you know how to work a radio , do n't you ?
do n't ask me . the guy 's completely out to lunch .
what ?
oh , god .
their what ?
do n't start a legal argument with me , this island is n't your property , and neither are these animals !
trespassing , sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here , did you know that ?
look ! sarah !
something 's wrong .
damn it , be sure ! !
i think she 's with sarah !
i have to find kelly !
head for the roof !
for sixty seconds , maybe ! look at this ! you could-
it 'll hold !
this is single-wall construction ! it 's just a shack !
we 're sure as hell not going back out there ''
we ca n't stay in here !
she 's with sarah !
where 's kelly ?
come on !
i do n't know .
what are they ?
no .
lava ?
no way .
no .
what do you think they want ? !
what do they want ? !
no ! get in the car before they hear us !
so do it a favor and put it out of its misery !
it has a broken leg !
? !
dr. juttson , please take kelly back to camp right away . leave the other car for us and we 'll meet you there in an hour or so .
there ' no reason for name calling .
i do n't know these guys , but i know 'em . i 've seen 'em on japanese whalers , french barges trying to dump barrels of nuclear waste in the north atlantic . they 're all the same . they spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em , sink our boats , and then call us crazy .
our chance to do what ?
then this is our chance .
you ca n't stay , kelly , that 's it . it 's too dangerous .
do you see any family resemblance here ?
oh , my god .
no way .
she 's nuts .
she 's gutty .
now 's the perfect time . the animal just fed , so it wo n't stalk us for food . predators do n't hurt when they 're not hungry .
you gentlemen feel you have to do this now ?
do n't let it out of your hands again . can the kid walk ?
four , counting the one in the chamber .
how many rounds did you find for that weapon ?
it 's called self-testing . but in your case , it sounds more like self-destruction . a uniquely human characteristic . in fact , human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think that 's our function . maybe every few sons , some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world , clears the decks , and lets evolution proceed to his next phase . maybe death and destruction are our job , maybe we 're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that-
you remember that guy , about twenty years ago , i forget his name , but he climbed everest without any oxygen , came down almost dead . and they asked him , `` why did you go up there to die ? '' and he said `` i did n't . i went up there to live . ''
but why ?
somewhere on this island , there exits the greatest predator that ever lived . and the second greatest predator must take him down .
i do n't care about my life . but if i 'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
so the truth is more important to you than your life ?
yes . and people will live in the absence of truth .
it 'll still exit if they go on not knowing , wo n't it ?
because it exists .
why should they ?
so that others would know about this place ?
why did you come here ?
just -- flawed . very deeply flawed .
feeling a bit blue , are we ?
a statistical phenomenon . says everything in the world goes in streaks . it 's real , you see it everywhere -- in weather , in river flooding , in baseball , in blackjack , in stock markets . once things go bad , they tend to stay bad . bad things cluster . they go to hell together .
what 's that ?
you ever heard of gambler 's ruin ?
we 'd never make it past the raptors . trust me , i have some experience in this matter .
look , we have two choices . we can hike back down to the lagoon , where we can sit for two days , in the open , next to a heavily used water source while we 're waiting for your boat to arrive , or we can head for the village , where we might find some shelter and we can call for help .
no . i 'm quite certain you ca n't .
birdshit ?
these formations . they 're dried --
what ?
ian . it 's guano .
ian , they will misplace our evidence , shoot holes in our testimony , and say some special effects genius created the animals . the only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a t-rex in the middle of times square .
maybe . maybe not .
you know , even if we do get those tapes back , people are going to say it 's just another hoax . ian malcolm 's alien autopsy .
they 're pushing us over the cliff .
what ? !
oh , god .
then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back . i 'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now . this expedition is over .
they will come after me . but i can collect some stool samples , for dna with that , nick 's tapes , and the rest of you to back me up , it should stand when we get back .
all right . i 'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now . i feel vindicated . john hammond will too . do you have enough to publish ?
i swear to god , it works with lions sometimes ! there we are -- your baby is free --
are you insane ? !
born free , as free as the wind blows . as free as the grass grows --
current evidence seems to be to the contrary , would n't you say ? ! give it to them !
that 's impossible , they ca n't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here !
think fast , sarah .
it has to be temporary , something that 'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows ...
can you set up ?
john hammond .
funded by whom ?
no ! we 're an independently funded expedition .
i 'm her father .
lighten up , ian , you sound like a high school vice-principal .
you 're going home . i 'm sending a radio call for the boats . we 'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them .
what do you want to do , ian , lock her up for curiosity ? where do you think she gets it ?
you know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation , but you did n't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in . you do n't have the faintest idea what 's going on on this island !
that 's a scientific impossibility , you know . heisenberg uncertainty principle . whatever you study , you also change .
no more smoking . we leave no scent of any kind . no hair tonics , no cologne , seal all our food in plastic bags . we will observe and document , but we will not interact .
where 's ian ?
where 's kelly ?
jump !
what are you-
no .
there 's , uh -- there 's an unwritten rule when a news crew is in a war zone . you stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on . whether or not you feel lucky . one `` no '' from anybody in the group and you turn around right there , no question asked , nobody embarrassed . well ? do we go on ? immediately :
i 'm trying !
hold it down , nick !
we 'll kill it with too much , we 'll put it into respiratory arrest ! i 'm almost done . damn it , i need another adhesive , something pliable i can --
give it more morphine !
that little black line means death for this infant . the fibula wo n't heal straight , so the ankle joint ca n't pivot when he stands on his hind feet . the baby wo n't be able to run , and probably ca n't even walk . it 'll be crippled , and a predator will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old .
that little black line ?
ian , nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army .
ruining everything , that 's what they 're doing . you could choke on the diesel smoke already !
ian , if we recall the boat now , we 've made two invasive landings in one day . that 'll have to go in any paper i write , and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated . you know the academic world as well as i do , once they smell blood in the water , you 're dead . our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic . that means if we bend a blade of grass , we bend it right back the way it-
the kid scores with cheap sentiment .
oh , no !
-- way we could safely --
i believe in him .
he does n't need a friend , he needs a shrink .
ian 's a very good friend of mine .
oh , please . how am i supposed to keep a straight face when -- -- johnny cash here tells me i 'm going to skull island ?
you think this is all a joke ?
hey , i would n't want to spook the woolly mammoths .
very noble of you . you do n't think you 're bringing that thing onto the island , do you ?
women . 'bout eighty percent female in greenpeace .
that must be interesting . what drew you there ?
i was a cameraman for nightline for six years , been freelance since '91 . do a lot of work for greenpeace .
so what 's your story , nick ?
runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait .
you 've got to be kidding .
can the kid walk ?
ask her .
you go if you like , but we 're not waiting for you . move it out ! !
we have to send someone to look for him !
move where ? our boat 's not coming for two days , your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
if we ca n't stay in the rex 's territory , we have to move tonight .
none of that matters . our communications equipment 's been destroyed . if your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff , and i 'm guessing by the look on his face --
hey , we came here to observe , you came here to strip-mine the place ! it 's a looter mentality , all you care about is what you can take .
theoretically , yeah , but we 've never shut down the whole system . it may not come back at all .
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did . if i understand correctly , all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct ?
i will not do it . you 'll have to get somebody else , because i will not .
we 're talking , my dear , about a calculated risk , which is the only option left to us . we will never find the command nedry used . he covered his tracks far too well , and i think it 's obvious he 's not coming back . so shutting down the system - -
where did the vehicles stop ?
phones are out too .
the monitors are failing .
find nedry ! check the vending machines !
fences are failing , all over the park ! a few minor systems , he said !
what now ?
woah , woah , woah , what the hell , what the hell ?
well , nedry said a few systems would go off-line , did n't he ?
the door security systems are shutting down .
what ?
it could have been worse , john . it could have been a lot worse .
so how much for our first tour . two no-shows and one sick triceratops .
visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage .
rotten luck , this storm . get my grandchildren on the radio will you ? i do n't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain .
i found a way to re-route through the program . i 'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop .
damn !
ladies and gentlemen , last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes . drop what you are doing and leave now .
it 's not worth taking the chance , john .
you 're sure we have to ?
that storm center has n't dissipated or changed course . we 're going to have to cut the tour short , i 'm afraid . pick it up again tomorrow where we left off .
stop the program ! stop the program !
uh - - mr. hammond - -
'bout thirty seconds .
how long will this take ?
no trick to it . just stop running the program . leaving them unattended .
how would we cut off the lysine ?
the lysine contingency - it 's intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island , but we could use it now . dr. wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism . animals ca n't manufacture the amino acid lysine . unless they 're continually supplied with lysine by us , they 'll go into a coma and die .
yeah , again , in theory , but - -
but would we get the phones back ?
wait a minute . what exactly does this mean ?
no , no , no , that 's crazy , you 're out of your mind , he 's absolutely out of his mind - -
two million - - great . that would help . oh good , that 'll take no time .
uh - - about two million .
how many lines of code are there ?
what one ?
i ran a key check on every stroke nedry entered today . it 's all pretty standard stuff , until this one - -
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours ? i mean , what 's hanging us up ?
i got an eighteen minute window . eighteen minutes , and your company catches up on ten years of research .
i was wondering , how are you planning to beat the security ?
that 's up to your guy on the boat . seven o'clock tomorrow night , at the east dock . make sure he got it right .
mr nedry , mr nedry . the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then .
what ? no menthol ?
how am i supposed to transport them ?
remember - - viable embryos . they 're no use to us if they do n't survive .
oh , i 'll get 'em all .
dodgson , dodgson . we got dodgson here ! see , nobody cares . nice hat . what are you trying to look like , a secret agent ?
you should n't use my name .
oh , you know , if it 's alright , i 'd like to stay with dr. harding and finish with the trike . is that okay ?
doctors , if you please - - i have to insist we get moving .
anybody at all . feel free to speak up .
yours was fully illustrated , honey .
uh - - anybody else think we should n't be out here ?
alan ? where are we going ? you see something ?
the question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem , and therefore , how could you assume you can control it ? you have plants right here in this building , for example , that are poisonous . you picked them because they look pretty , but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they 're living in and will defend themselves . violently , if necessary .
please - - let 's hear something from the others . dr. grant ? i am sorry - - dr. sattler ?
shhhhh !
paleo-dna ? from what source ? where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood ? !
i 'll catch up with you . you can go with the others .
sure . i 've got a gas powered jeep . i can drop her at the visitor 's center before i make the boat with the others .
you wo n't be able to miss them . ca n't miss them .
there 's only one way to be positive . i need to see some droppings . i have to see the dinosaur 's droppings .
pretty sure .
are you sure ?
yes . we know they 're toxic , but the animals do n't eat them .
that 's pharmacological . from local plant life .
they are ? i 'll be damned .
these are dilated . take a look .
yes , mitotic , pupils should be constricted .
six weeks ?
imbalance , disorientation , labored breathing . seems to happen about every six weeks or so .
okay , i 'm following the tubing . i 'm going down a passage way . how long does this stuff go for ? could you guys talk a little bit to me ?
good ! keep going , now . the cable will terminate in a big , gray box .
mr. arnold ? he 's not answering me . okay i 'm on the grating .
look .
well , because you 're a - - i 'm a - -
why ?
but you know , i should really be the one going .
john ... .
this is just a delay , that 's all this is . all major theme parks have had delays . when they opened disneyland in 1956 , nothing worked , nothing .
control ? ! you never had control ! i was overwhelmed by the power of this place . so i made a mistake too . i did n't have enough respect for that power , and it 's out now . you 're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces . john , there 's nothing worth picking up . the only thing that matters now are the people we love . alan , lex , and tim . and john , they 're out there where people are dying - - people are dying , you know ?
once we have control again we - -
john , john . john , you 're still building onto that flea circus , that illusion . and now you 're adding onto it by what you 're doing here . that 's the illusion .
you 're absolutely right . yes , you 're right . hiring nedry was a mistake , that 's obvious . we 're over- dependent on automation , i can see that now . but that 's all correctable for the next time around .
but you ca n't think through this one . you have to feel it .
but with this place , i - - i wanted to give them something real , something that was n't an illusion , something they could see and touch . an aim devoid of merit .
a carousel - - and a seesaw . they all moved , motorized of course , but people would swear they could see the fleas . `` i see the fleas , mummy ! ca n't you see the fleas ? '' clown fleas , high wire fleas , fleas on parade ...
carousel .
they 'll all be fine . who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert ?
malcolm 's okay for now . i gave him a shot of morphine .
we 're - - still perfecting a viewing system . the raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting .
alan , these are n't bones anymore .
give time , they 'll out draw the t-rex . guarantee it .
oh my god .
fascinating animals , fascinating .
could i have a tissue please ?
oh my god .
there you are . out you come .
come along . i know my way around a kitchen . come along .
i have samples all over the kitchen .
i 'm sorry for the dramatic entrance , but i 'm in a hurry . will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then ?
did i say jerk ?
i ca n't get it ! i ca n't get it unless i move !
ellie , get the gun ! try to reach the gun !
you ca n't hold it by yourself !
ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks !
yes , unless they figured out how to open doors .
it 's just the two raptors , right ? you 're sure the third one 's contained ?
i 'll just finish . yeah , i want to finish .
are you sure ?
and when she swallows the stones , she swallows the poison berries too . that 's what makes her sick . good work tim .
- - and swallows fresh ones .
- - barfs them up - -
- - what happens is that after a while , the stones get smooth , every six weeks , so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - which is called a gizzard , and it helps them mash their food , but what happens after a while - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - like birds . what happen is , they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - like birds - -
- - totally incidental unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it 's - -
elm that 's it , it explains the periodicity , the - -
yeah , i know .
not just every six weeks .
constantly sick .
i know .
ellie , i 've been thinking there 's something about the periodicity does n't had up .
it 's my favorite .
oh ellie . it 's so beautiful . it 's the most beautiful thing i ever saw .
dilophosaurus .
oh , shit .
ca n't we see the unfertilized host eggs ? !
wait a minute ! how do you interrupt the cellular mitosis ? ! ?
we 're out of a job .
so what are you thinking ?
how did you do it ? ! how did you do this ? !
we were right !
ellie , they 're absolutely - - they 're moving in herds . they do move in herds !
say again ?
you 've got a t-rex ! ? he 's got a t-rex ! a t-rex ! he said he's- -
they were wrong . case closed . this thing does n't live in a swamp to support it 's body weight for god 's sake !
ellie , we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness . it does n't apply , they 're totally wrong ! this is a warm-blooded creature . they 're totally wrong .
the - - agility . you 're right !
the movement !
what kind of park is it ?
why would they care what we think ?
small versions of adults , honey .
and what are those ?
sattler .
uh , this is our paleobotanist , dr ellie ... ..
okay , who 's the jerk ?
it frustrates me so much that i love you , that i need to strangle you right now !
yeah , plenty . some of them ca n't walk !
anything else , you old fossil ?
the cretaceous .
the what ?
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous .
alright , the one on the airplane had an accident , but usually babies do n't smell .
they do smell . some of them smell.. babies smell .
oh my god , they do not ! they do n't smell .
they smell .
cheap , cheap , cheap .
oh , ellie , look . they 're noisy , they 're messy , they 're sticky , they 're expensive .
well , not one of those , well yeah , a possibly one at some point could be a good thing . what 's so wrong with kids ?
yeah , i know , you know ... kids . you want to have one of those ?
you know , if you really wanted to scare the kid you could 've just pulled a gun on him .
yes . good shape , too . five , six feet high . i 'm guessing nine feet long . look at the - -
postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments . velociraptor ?
that 's good . that 's right ! they died around a dried-up puddle ! without fighting each other . this is looking good .
a drought . the lake was shrinking - -
if they died together , they lived together . suggests some kind of social order .
the taphonomy sure looks that way .
they died together ?
four complete skeletons . . . . such a small area . . . the same time horizon - -
like hell it is !
it 's all right .
because we 're being hunted . from the bushes straight ahead .
why not ?
no . we ca n't .
i can see the shed from here ! we can make it if we run !
c'mon on , this way .
the shutdown must have turned off all the fences . goddamn it ! even nedry knew better than to mess with the raptor fence .
oh my god . aw , god .
stick to my heels .
okay , i 'm on channel two .
we 'll discuss sexism in survival situations when i get back . you just take me through this step by step . i 'm on channel two .
come on , let 's go .
okay .
i 'm going with you .
you ca n't just stroll down the road , you know .
i ca n't wait anymore . something went wrong . i 'm going to go get the power back on .
what 's that ?
what about the lysine contingency ? we could put that into effect !
they 're not here .
alan ? !
i do n't know .
do you see anything ?
alan !
dr. grant !
the other car !
ellie , com one ! !
no , no , no !
dr. sattler , i 've seen a lot of animal attacks . people just disappear . no blood , no trace . that 's the way it happens .
that 's right . but they never attack the same place twice . they were testing the fences for weaknesses . systematically . they remembered .
the fences are electrified , right ?
they show extreme intelligence , even problem solving . especially the big one . we bred eight originally , but when she came in , she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others . that one - -when she looks at you , you can see she 's thinking working things out . she 's the reason we have to feed 'em like this . she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came .
yes . it 's not a criticism , by the way .
- - shut up .
yes ?
that 'll - it 'd be a first ; man and dinosaur all die together . john 's plan .
seven days ? ! seven days ? ! oh , great . oh good - - clever .
must go faster , go , go . open it up , 5th gear , 5th gear ! here it comes ! stand on it ! fifth - stand on it , 5th gear , go !
faster ! shit , shit , shit , faster !
must go faster , it 's getting closer - must go faster !
faster , faster !
please - - chance it .
can we chance moving him ?
yeah .
dino droppings ?
alan ?
no one could have predicted dr. grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle !
alan ?
and even if we have n't seen it yet , i 'm quite sure it 's going on in this park right now .
unpredictability ... .
microscopic - - never repeat , and vastly affect the outcome . that 's what ?
oh , imperfections ?
- - on your hand , the amount of blood distending in your vessels , imperfections in the skin - -
alan , listen to this .
it changed . why ? okay , back over your wrist . because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
uh - - thumb ! the same way .
it simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems . it 's only principle is the butterfly effect . a butterfly can flap its wings in peking and in central park you get rain instead of sunshine .
i 'm still not clear on chaos .
you see ? the tyrannosaur does n't obey set patterns or park schedules . it 's the essence of chaos .
dinosaur eats man . woman inherits the earth .
god creates dinosaurs . god destroys dinosaurs . god creates man . man destroys god . man creates dinosaurs .
anti-nature .
it 's anti-nature .
when people try to control things that it 's out of their power - -
and scary .
and scary .
i know , it 's very exciting .
i get ah - -
that 's right . will break through .
no ? non-linear equations ? strange attractions ? dr. sattler , i refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction !
no .
because he 's like me . he 's a digger .
why not ?
grant ? you 'll never get him out of montana .
if two experts sign off on the island , the insurance guys 'll back off . i already got ian malcolm , but they think he 's too trendy . they want alan grant .
juanito , if they pull the funding , that will really slow things down . if they pull the funding that 's going to slow things down around here .
hammond hates inspections . they slow everything down .
i understand that . i 'm sorry to hear that . we 'd be well advised to deal with this situation now . the insurance company - -
he had to leave early to be with his daughter . she 's getting a divorce .
you 're telling me that we 're facing a $ 20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and hammond could n't even be bothered to see me ?
he sends his apologies .
what 's this i hear at the airport hammond 's not even here ?
hola , bienvenido
hola , juanito
then they 're expensive . put them back .
yeah .
are they heavy ?
in a box under my seat .
hey ! where did you find those things ?
people were gettin ' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
i ca n't believe we invited ian malcolm .
up and down , up and down !
dilophosaurus .
what are we looking for ?
i ca n't see .
brakes ? no . no brakes . they 're electric cars , guided by this track in the roadway , and totally non-polluting , top of the line !
hey ! where are the brakes ?
have a heart gentlemen . their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion .
thank you .
i do n't believe it . i expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one i 've got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer ! ?
i 've never been a rich man . i hear it 's nice . is it nice ?
that 's conservative , of course . there 's no reason to speculate wildly .
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
sure , they will , they will . we 'll have a - - coupon day or something .
donald , this park was not built to carter only to the super rich . everyone in the world 's got a right to enjoy these animals .
and we can charge anything we want ! two thousand a day , ten thousand a day - - people will pay it ! and then there 's the merchandising - -
relax donald , relax . they 're scientists . they ought to be curious .
john , we - - what i 'm just saying ... .
no , we do n't have any animatronics here . these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park .
this is overwhelming , john . are these characters animatronics ?
forty-eight hours from now , i 'll be accepting your apologies . now get out of the way . so i can see them !
let 's get something straight , john . this is not a weekend excursion , this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island . your investors , whom i represent , are deeply concerned . forty-eight hours from now , if they - - - -are n't convinced . i 'm not convinced . and i can shut you down john .
and the concrete moats , and the motion sensor tracking systems . donald , dear boy , do try to relax and enjoy yourself .
the full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place ?
tim , i 'm right here . easy catch . easy catch . count to three..
are you crazy ? what if you miss ? i hate it up here .
tim , you 're going to have to let go of the fence . tim ! get down right now . get off the fence ! now !
you 're crazy ! i 'm not gon na jump !
go , go , go , jump !
tim , you 're gon na have to let go . i 'm going to count to three .
i ca n't ! i 'm scared !
nope .
it 's a bit of a climb . you guys think you can make it ?
amphibian dna .
but - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls .
you know what this is ? it 's a dinosaur egg . the dinosaurs are breeding .
this is a seventy-seven ton animal . come on over , lex ! just think of it as a big cow . look at it 's teeth ? come here , girl . this is a seventy-seven ton animal . just think of it as a big cow !
it 's good protein . come on , lex . why do n't you touch it ? look at his nose .
come on , try some . take a bite .
it 's so strong ! look at its nose . need help ?
take a bite , take a bite . i 'm not letting go .
a do-you-think-he-saurus rex .
you got me .
a do-you-think-he-saurus . what do you call a blind dinosaur 's dog ?
i do n't know . what do you call a blind dinosaur ?
what do you call a blind dinosaur ?
could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
straight-a brainiac !
`` thunder lizard ! ''
it 's okay to call them brontosaurs , tim . it 's a great name . it 's a romantic name . it means `` thunder lizard '' .
maybe -- it 's hard to say .
i doubt it .
you 'll probably be safe enough on your own --
that 's a good idea .
'course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help .
what if the car falls ? what if the wheels fall ?
so am i going to help you with your foot ?
this is impossible . how am i going ... i ca n't make it . this is ... it 's about fifty feet .
me too . okay . well , the main thing about climbing is never , never look down , never .
no .
it 's just like coming out of a tree house . did your dad ever build you a tree house , tim , eh ?
yes it is .
okay , that 's not so bad , ah tim ?
that 's okay . listen , give me your hand .
i threw up .
tim , i 'll come back for you . i 'll get lex out first .
i 'm stuck . the seat 's got my feet !
tim , are you okay ?
are you okay ? can you move ? tim ! are you okay ?
triceratops was a constant browser , and constant browsers would be constantly sick .
these look kind of familiar .
really ?
and his book was a lot fatter than yours .
whichever one you are .
tim . which car were you planning on - -
tim .
listen , ahh - -
because they sure do n't look like birds to me . i heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in mexico - -
oh , yeah - - great .
i read your book .
there 's got ta be something - -
what ? what can we do ?
we got ta do something .
oh my god !
relatively .
you 're sure ? !
keep absolutely still - - it 's vision 's based on movement !
when you got ta go , you got ta go .
where does he think he 's going ?
fine .
i know .
i did n't say you were scared .
i did n't say i was scared .
what 's to be scared about ? it 's just a little hiccup in the power .
kids get scared .
well , i did n't ask . why would n't they be ?
the kids okay ?
their radio 's out too . gennaro said to stay put .
no .
you want to talk about this ?
yeah , they hate me .
machines hate you ?
i must 've touched something . this happens all the time . it must be my fault . machines hate me .
you have n't touched did n't touch anything . we 're stopping . we 've stopped .
what 'd i touch ? !
why ? oh , i 'm sorry . are you two , uh - - are ? i wish you the best luck .
why ?
by the way , dr. sattler - she 's not like , uh , available , is she ? - -
occasionally . always on the lookout for the future ex- mrs. malcolm .
you 're married ?
me ? oh , hell yes . three . i love 'em . i love kids . anything at all can and does happen .
you got any kids ?
to ellie ) you will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything ?
you have no idea .
to grant ) she 's , uh - - tenacious .
not without massive sequence gaps !
cloning from what ? ! loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand !
try to !
so you two dig up dinosaurs ?
after careful consideration , dr. grant - - so have i .
mr. hammond , i 've decided not to endorse your park .
what does he mean by `` target audience '' ?
you four are going to have a little company out in the park . spend a little time with our target audience . maybe they 'll help you get the spirit of this place .
who ?
ah - - they 're here .
do they show intelligence ? with the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
yes , yes , yes , which is why we take extreme precautions . they viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
alan grant . tell me , what kind of metabolism do they have ? what 's their growth rate ? rate of growth .
robert . robert muldoon , my game warden from kenya . bit of an alarmist , i 'm afraid , but he 's dealt with the raptors more than anyone .
wu ?
blood temperature feels like high eighties .
let 's get outta here !
sorry ! it 's kind of a ride !
ca n't you stop these things ? !
we clocked the t-rex at thirty-two miles an hour .
- - and you 're going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that ? ! like that ! ? this is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness .
the brachiosaur ? thirty .
that thing 's got a what , twenty-five , twenty-seven foot neck ?
for a further three years .
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
i could compensate you by fully funding your dig
no , i 'm sorry , that would n't be possible . we 've just discovered a new skeleton , and - -
well , it 's - - right up your alley . look , why do n't you both come on down for the weekend . love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well . i 've got a jet standing by at choteau .
not to put a fine point on it , your kind . let 's face it , in your particular field , you 're the top minds . if i could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know , give a wee testimonial - - i could get back on schedule - - - -schedule .
what kind of opinions ?
well , i 'm afraid i do . there 's one , a particular pebble in my shoe . he represents my investors . he says they insist on outside opinions .
i , uh , do n't really know any . we - -
not just kids - - for everyone . we 're going to open next year . unless the lawyers kill me first . i do n't care for lawyers . you ?
john hammond . and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant .
and who in god 's name do you think you are ... . ?
for today , i guarantee it .
hey , we were saving that !
phone security systems , everything works . you ask for it , we got it !
what works ?
yes .
i am gon na have to find the others and get you to a doctor . will you look after tim , lex ?
i 'm coming up there tim ! i 'm coming to get you ! lex , i 've got to get him !
timmy , listen to dr. grant !
it 's am easy catch , you let - - go - - you do the counting , you count it , tim . one , two , three -- you do all the counting , okay ?
you 're gon na get electrocuted electrified !
shhhh . tim , i 'm right here below you . easy catch . one , two , three . you count it yourself . one , two , three - -
timmy ! do as he says ! timmy ! do as dr. grant says , quick !
timmy , let go ! you 're gon na have to let go ! count to three . i 'll catch you .
do as he says ! the power 's coming back , timmy !
timmy ! the power is coming down , quick !
c'mon tim , move down , damn it !
okay . keep low . follow me .
let 's go !
bet you 'll never look at birds the same way again !
please !
watch how it eats !
well , on the tour - - the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps . they mutated the dinosaur 's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs . now , some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female , in a single sex environment . malcolm was right ! look , life found a way !
what 's that ?
you 're a beautiful big animal .
i like cows .
it 's okay ! it 's okay ! it 's a brachiosaur !
go away !
all night .
all night ?
i 'll stay awake .
what if the dinosaur comes back while we 're all asleep ?
i guess we 'll just have to evolve too .
what are you gon na do now if you do n't have to dig of dinosaur bones any more ?
dorkatops !
they 're just doing what they do . well the other kind - - - - just do what they do .
oh , i hate the other kind .
tim , tim , tim ... .
no , i did n't hear anything . no , we 're okay .
hear that ? are you hearing this ?
alright .
go that 's the way we 're going to go . what do you say ?
it 's safe .
it 's safe .
it 's safe ?
i 'm trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain , you know !
liar ! you said you would n't leave !
that 's not what i 'm going to do . good !
he left us ! he left us !
shhh - - i 'm right here , lex . i 'm going to look after you . i 'm going to help your brother . i want you to stay here and wait for me , okay ?
dad - - dad - -
let 's get you out .
he 's knocked out ! he 's knocked out ! dr. grant ! dr. grant ! daddy , daddy !
dr. grant ! dr. grant !
tim ! lex !
wait a minute ? what do you mean `` worked '' ? everything is still off !
that will teach you to trust grandpa .
you 're all right , john you 're okay . it 's just you do n't have intelligence . you have `` thinktelligence . '' you think narrowly and call it `` being focused . '' you do n't see the consequences . you 're very good at solving problems , at getting answers - - but you just do n't know the right questions .
i think perhaps i 'll just sit down . i do n't suppose you think all that much of me now , do you ?
there 's nothing that great about discovery . what 's so great about discovery ? it 's a violent , penetrative act that scars what it explores . what you call discovery i call the rape of the natural world !
i do n't understand this luddite attitude , especially from a scientist . how could we stand in the light of discovery and not act ?
hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam . dinosaurs had their shot . nature selected them for extinction .
but this is nature ! why not give an extinct species a second chance ? ! i mean , condors . condors are on the verge of extinction - - if i 'd created a flock of them on the island , you would n't be saying any of this ! have anything to say at all !
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they did n't stop to think if they should . science can create pesticides , but it ca n't tell us not to use them . science can make a nuclear reactor , but it ca n't tell us not to build it !
you do n't give us our due credit . our scientists have done things no one could ever do before .
do n't you see the danger , john , inherent in what you 're doing here ? genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet . but you wield it like a kid who 's found his dad 's gun .
alright donald , alright , but just let him talk . i want to hear all viewpoints . i truly do . i truly am .
john , the kind of control you 're attempting is not possible . if there 's one thing the history of evolution has taught us , it 's that life will not be contained . life breaks free . it expands to new territories . it crashes through barriers . painfully , maybe even.. dangerously , but and ... well , there it is .
your silence intrigues me .
dr. grant , dr. sattler -- you 've heard of chaos theory ?
do n't do that !
john , john .
a load , if i may say so . of fashionable number crunching , thats all it is !
i certainly have ! very clearly ! because of the behavior of the system in phase space !
codswollop ! ian , you 've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island !
john does n't subscribe to chaos , particularly what it has to say about his little science project !
chaotician , actually ! chaotician !
you 'll have to get use to dr. malcolm ! he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality , especially for a mathematician !
thanks , dad .
i do n't blame people for their mistakes , but i do ask that they pay for them .
i do n't think there 's been any debate . there 's no debate ... my mistakes ... .
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you , dennis . i really will not .
you 're right , john . you 're absolutely right . everything 's my problem .
i 'm sorry about your financial problems . i really am . but they are your problems .
i am totally unappreciated in my time . we can run the whole park from this room , with minimal staff , for up to three days . you think that kind of automation is easy ? or cheap ? you know anybody who can network eight connection machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what i bid this job ? because i 'd sure as hell like to see them try .
sure .
robert - - i wonder if perhaps you would be kind good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren .
there 's no sign of him anywhere .
well ?
thanks , steve .
tell them when they get back to the cars .
sustain winds 45 knots .
ray , start the tour program .
i 'll keep an eye on it . maybe it 'll swing south like the last one .
why did n't i build in orlando ?
shut up ! you 're scaring me . stop ! you 're scaring me .
you 're gon na get electrocuted electrified ! the power 's coming back !
i 'm afraid i am gon na fall !
jump , timmy ! it 's too late !
that was great !
that 's not funny .
hey lex , you forgot to say gazundheit .
what ?
hey lex , ahhhchooo ! hey lex , com here .
that 's what i said ! you 're a nerd ! they do n't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds !
i 'm a hacker !
that means they only eat vegetables . but for you , i think they 'd make an exception .
they 're not monsters , lex . they 're just animals . and these are herbivores .
no , no , sh , sh , sh - - stop ! stop ! stop ! do n't let the monsters come over here !
yeah , you were n't in that last one .
they do n't bother me .
i hate trees !
what if we fall ? i hate trees .
why are we hurrying if there 's nothing wrong ?
i do n't know ! i 'm sorry !
why did you do this ?
i do n't know , i do n't know . i 'm sorry - -
turn it off , lex ! turn it off !
i 'm sorry - - i 'm sorry - -
excellent .
what 's going to happen to the goat ? he 's going to eat the goat ? !
we love the presents .
thanks for the presents .
we miss you .
no , no ... listen , when i get back to new york we 'll meet with the board .
you want to put in chain saws ?
chain saws .
hey , smart-ass , i 'm up here right now in a ... luxury alpine retreat , with a two million dollar view of the lake .
do n't tell me you 're still thinking of buying casa de psycho ...
you tell them if they come up to seventy-five , i 'll cut them in on the crystal lake package .
ken , we 've been through this ...
fifty ? we need seventy-five .
fifty .
really ? how much ?
ken , it 's bruce . listen , we 've got a nibble on the pendleton financing .
hello ?
i want to look at the rest of the house .
i really think we should go back ...
there does n't seem to be any water damage . kind of cozy , actually .
help me with this .
mister biller ... now that we can see the lake , i think we should follow the shoreline to --
structure might be salvageable ... let 's see what the interior looks like .
you learn something new every day . let 's go .
i did n't think there were any houses up here ...
i know ... but we left the main trail ... and i ca n't find any landmarks around here ... i 've been trying to figure it out but ...
you have a map .
i think we 're lost .
yeah ?
mister biller ?
great .
okay ... well ... i think it 's this way ...
get rid of them .
just a deer , mister biller . part of the local wildlife .
jesus christ !
i do n't think you 're getting in the spirit of things , janet . we 'll buy whatever studies we need --
logging ? we 'll need an environmental impact study for that ...
beautiful trees ... sturdy trunks ... lots of branches ... we can do some great logging up here .
we 're not talking about truth , we 're talking about perception . and the perception is that crystal lake means inbred psychopaths running around the hills with axes and hockey masks chopping up teenagers . that , my dear , is what we call an _image problem_ .
that 's not true ...
and do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks crystal lake is filled with corpses ?
no , but ...
do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years ?
i do n't think the people who live around here would like that very much ...
jas ... jason voorhees ... he 's here ...
janet , goddamnit , what 's going on ?
oh my god ... this is his house ... _we 're in his fucking house_ ...
who 's there ?
he ... he 's here ...
janet , are you okay ? are you there ?
yeah . ken said there was another guy there ... _big_ guy ... then he dropped the phone . what 's going on ?
other guy ?
what about that other guy ?
i do n't know ...
where 's ken ? is he all right ?
this is janet davenport -- i 'm the realtor .
who is this ? what 's going on ?
hello ?
come on .
who ?
_krueger_ ...
what happened ?
his camera ... it 's still recording .
what ?
it 's still on .
some kind of emergency back at the sheriff 's station . four deputies shot ... some kind of explosion ... i do n't know what 's going on , but they 're panicking back there .
what 's going on ?
fuck you .
i ca n't wait to hear your opening argument . `` ladies and gentlemen of the jury ... the defense will prove that jason voorhees did not kill all of these people . they , in fact , committed mass suicide and then buried themselves in his back yard ... ''
i know how this sounds , but that 's what happened .
ruby , come on . you witnessed a brutal triple murder and you 're having trouble accepting it . think about what you 're saying . you really expect a jury to believe that jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy ?
you 're about to be a media darling -- you might want to dress the part .
what ?
and we 're in the center ring . you sure you want to wear that blazer ?
quite a circus .
that 's my job .
i seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges .
i 'm not sure i 'd call them murder exactly . more like a couple of bar fights that got out of hand .
two .
did you find a scalpel ? did you find a murder weapon ?
take it easy , ruby ... it 's all right . now , try to think clearly ... do n't you mean _jason's_ hand ... do n't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed doctor layton 's throat ?
and this hand ... it ... it slashed doctor layton 's throat ... and the deputy . then it grabbed danny by the head ... and it pulled his head right down into his chest ... i could n't ... hayes lays a hand his shoulder .
jason 's . it came out of his chest ... a hand with long blades on the fingers ...
who 's chest ?
that 's right ... it ... it came right out of his chest ...
he does n't look like he 's going anywhere , bill . and if necessary , i can get a judicial order reaffirming the right of my client to speak to his attorney in private .
ruby ... this guy almost took out an entire tactical response team . you ca n't expect me to just leave you --
that 's right . was n't on any of the maps ... we could barely see it through the underbrush . place must 've been abandoned for twenty years .
a house ?
compared to this guy ... amateur .
i thought that was ted bundy .
shit . we 're still putting the victim list together . you 'll need a forklift for the case file . i suggest you hire some help , and do n't expect to get a lot of sleep for the next few months . you 're about to defend the most notorious serial killer in american history .
what are the charges ?
your ... client is being booked right now . he 'll be in cell five .
three . where 's my client ?
a seminal film . first ever depiction of a fully nude triple impalement .
`` zombie sluts from beyond the grave . ''
this is a legitimate cinematic genre . just like westerns , comedies , film noire , science fiction ...
you watch this garbage ?
i do n't know if anything 's going to work in this case . therefore , we have to try everything .
you think that 's going to work ?
wrong . jason ca n't get a fair trial because of _these_ .
because everyone knows he 's guilty ...
so ... why ca n't jason get a fair trial ?
video store ?
now ... i think the video store 's open for another couple of hours . let 's go .
it 's all right . now ... we 're going to need a really good head-doctor for this . someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years ... we 'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who 's willing to testify for us .
sorry .
i think it 's our best bet . they 're taking apart his house right now ... they found weapons , blood , a mountain of evidence . we ca n't say he was framed .
are you going to plead insanity ?
my client ... is dead . but i think he 's a free man .
what happened ? where 's jason ?
for the moment ! you 've only got about two minutes left ! hurry ! ruby takes off towards the cineplex ...
are you all right ?
let 's split up . you take the left side , i 'll take the right . we 'll meet in front of the cineplex .
we 're down to seven minutes .
if i give you a bigger dose , it 'll give you a heart attack .
ten minutes ...
about ten minutes .
how long will the effect last ?
ten cc 's of this shit and you wo n't be dreaming about anything .
so you think it might counteract krueger 's ability to make us hallucinate ?
_neurolar_ . it 's a stimulant -- it 's also a serotonin inhibitor . it suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus ... the part of the brain that controls dreaming .
what 's that ?
then we 're all in a lot of trouble .
and if he 's not ?
krueger 's in the real world ... maybe he 's mortal , like us .
think it 'll do any good ?
i used to go hunting with my father when i was a kid .
you know how to use one of those ?
krueger 's the greater danger right now . we have to stop him . _springwood_ . that 's where he 'll go . that 's where he 's always gone . but springwood 's not like crystal lake . there 's a couple hundred thousand people there . he could be anywhere .
great . now there 's _two_ serial killers on the loose .
i do n't know ... but i think he 's pissed .
where 's he going ?
except this victim got away . i wonder if --
if i 'm right , this happened before the krueger murders in springwood . that means that jason might 've been krueger 's first victim .
alone ... but with a murderous fury inside him ... which led him to kill dozens of people .
so krueger thinks jason 's dead ... leaves him in the lake ... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore ... crawls off into the woods ... where he lives the rest of his life alone .
jason 's asleep ... maybe he 's dreaming of himself as a young boy ... and that boy is sitting right here . i think he 's some kind of projection from jason 's subconscious .
how 's that possible ?
this is jason 's rem pattern ... and this is the boy 's rem pattern . they 're identical .
checking out a theory . just keep talking to him .
what are you doing ?
a cameraman caught him on videotape . joe , i saw an entire sheriff 's squad fighting and losing against an enemy that was n't there ...
you saw him ?
it was krueger , was n't it ?
it 's all right . i 'm simply in shock ... this is what happens to people when they experience events they ca n't understand or comprehend . the mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it 's been exposed to . i 'm going to need a lot of therapy .
i was there once ... that was enough . besides ... i have to go out to jason 's house tomorrow . they 're ... digging up some new evidence .
you 're not going to be there ?
i 'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night ... but i think i can do it . let me know what happens .
tomorrow . if you can clear it with the sheriff 's department .
great . when can you do it ?
then i 'd say we should put jason under again ... run another tape on him and see what happens . we 'll get extra data this time . video ... infrared ... the works .
not yet .
i do n't suppose i can go back to the university and chase young coeds again ... pretend this whole thing never happened ...
so what do we do ?
add it to the list .
that does n't make sense .
it 's as though there were two people in that room ... both of them asleep ... both of them dreaming .
_it 's a second rem pattern_ .
yeah , what is it ?
see this ?
yeah ... i think i understand ... you 're drunk , too .
do n't you see ? jason was _asleep_ . and he was dreaming -- the rem patterns prove that . and i saw finger blades just like krueger 's come out of jason 's chest . there has to be a connection .
uh-huh ...
that 's right . the murders in the eighties were never solved . but ... there were teenaged witnesses who said krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams ... and that if he killed you in a dream , it would kill you in the real world .
i thought you said krueger burned to death .
now ... . according to the file , krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. but get this -- beginning in 1984 , there was _another_ series of murders in springwood . all teenagers ... all killed in their sleep ... all killed with finger blades just like krueger 's .
fascinating .
he was a child killer in the late sixties ... in a town called springwood about eight miles from here . guess what his murder weapon was ? a glove with six-inch blades .
krueger ... does n't ring a bell .
well , i 'm onto something more useful . you ever hear of a man named fred krueger ?
me too . i 'm drunk .
i think i 'm onto something , joe .
he 's my client , and this is important . enjoy your waitresses .
there 's nothing to see here . he sleeps ... we record it . that 's all that happens .
i 'll take my chances . come on , i 'm buying .
that 's open to debate .
cute waitresses ?
there 's a pizza place over on market .
well , that 's it . he 'll be asleep in a few minutes , but his first rem-cycle probably wo n't kick in for another hour or so . is there a place we can get something to eat in this town ?
we 're going to need at least two full rem cycles to get a clear neurological profile . three hours minimum , six hours ideal .
how long will he need to be asleep ?
then i 'd say it 's bedtime for jason .
simple . we sedate him , induce a somnolesent state , and study his rem patterns when he 's unconscious . if he has the disorder , his rems will be highly abnormal . ruby smiles .
how do we prove it ?
not guilty by reason of insanity . case closed .
if we could prove that jason suffers from this disorder ... and that his homicidal behavior has been a direct result of a medical condition ...
insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes ... delusions ...
so jason does n't sleep ... how does that help us ?
it 's a neurological disorder affecting the hypothalamus . the part of the brain that causes sleepiness is inactive . they did n't know about it back in the sixties . even now , it 's not understood very well .
insomnolesence ...
it 's rare ... but there are cases where people go for years without sleep . they diagnosed jason with simple insomnia ... but that 's not what it looks like to me . he has every indication of having _insomnolesence_ .
that 's pretty weird . is it possible for someone to not sleep for months ?
the mother said the boy had n't slept for over three _months_ . a physical examination showed dilated pupils , temperature of one-oh-two , blood chemistry highly imbalanced ...
wait a minute . let me see that . she hands him the file .
not much here . jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia ... that 's about it .
you 're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma . and you 're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience . but it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience .
oh ?
no . you 've told me all i need to know .
what do you want -- a tidy psychological profile ? you want to hear that i was falsely accused of a crime i did n't commit ... and that 's driven me to defend others ? or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings ... talk about my childhood ...
that did n't sound very convincing .
i do n't `` rationalize '' anything . i 'm his lawyer -- he 's my client . that 's all .
do n't get me wrong . i do n't care . but the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do .
my job is not to determine his guilt or innocence . that 's up to the jury . my job is defend him .
so , what are you saying ... that he did n't kill all those people ?
well , jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned . his mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer . some time in the early eighties , there were a string of murders out by crystal lake ... people started saying it was jason ... back from the dead .
none of that 's true ?
that 's the problem with this case . everyone thinks they know jason 's life story . but they do n't . what you 're remembering is a _movie_ . fiction . in the movie , jason 's mother runs around , killing people after jason drowns in crystal lake
i thought she was a killer , too . you know ... that she chopped up a bunch of teenage camp counselors ... before she was decapitated .
so ?
i do n't believe it . jason 's mother died of ovarian cancer in 1969 .
well , i definitely feel sorry for you . august fourteenth , 1956 ... jason was brought in by his mother , who said the boy had n't slept for two weeks . doctor prescribed valium ...
no need . i 'm self-diagnosed . i have severe nympholepsy ... and i 'm a bed-wetter .
this sexual obsession of yours . have you considered going into therapy yourself ?
nurses . that 's why i went into medicine .
this is jason voorhees . they 'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair . if we 're going to argue insanity , we 're going to need something a little more concrete .
great . battling head doctors . we 'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt . hung jury .
this is bad , joe . the prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists . they 'll argue exactly the opposite . they 'll say he 's just pretending to be catatonic and he 's completely sane .
one of the deputies is pretty cute . i think she likes me .
oh ?
i always throw that in . it makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant .
he wets the bed ?
insomnia . not unusual for someone in his situation . not to mention he 's a bed-wetter .
doesnit sleep ?
no . when you put me on the stand , i 'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic , sociopathic personality . and he does n't sleep .
great . is that what you 're going to say when i put you on the stand ?
he 's fucking nuts .
well ?
well , as long as i admire it from afar it should n't worry me if it 's hollow .
a glorified office block . they keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living .
what is it really ?
it 's only majestic from here . when you get closer you see it for what it really is .
up there .
where do you live ?
you have been hearing the sordid side then .
you work in the insurance department ?
even the so-called new town is n't so new . only the people . people of the future living in buildings of the past . has anyone seen eduard ?
-- i 'm hoping to live in the old quarter .
what was the matter with it ?
fine -- terrible .
no , no , no -- quite a long time , yes .
have you worked here long ?
yes -- we do .
you look like brothers .
yes -- that 's us .
my assistants , i presume .
perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced .
yours is a very powerful and important firm -- it has a lot at stake .
-- small .
-- ah , but what if it < u > was n't < /u > ?
the formality of a trial would be too costly for them . they 're beginning to understand that it 's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support .
-- merely in the interests of order .
you were his friend . one link is all they need .
preliminary investigations may already be underway .
you could say we represent the < u > un < /u > official view of a well-ordered society .
heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest ?
not necessarily . a < u > wife < /u > would .
a true friend would do it .
then its authority is in doubt .
it 's my last and final one .
what an extraordinary request !
if i do n't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them . all my manuscripts -- just burn them . please .
another one ?
will you do me a favor then ?
yes .
-- you appreciate my writing .
not a chance . i 'm the thinnest person i know .
the castle gates were blockaded in the time of the great plague -- it 's an escape route . do n't get stuck .
a cenotaph -- a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere . but look --
an empty tomb ?
i was restoring some stones here in the upper section one day -- and i found this .
in a manner of speaking .
the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else -- was n't it part of the castle originally ? -- i always assumed there 'd be a gate or something . is n't there ?
what made you think < u > i 'd < /u > be able to get you into the castle ?
i 'm trying to find things out myself -- that 's the whole point .
there is < u > one < /u > thing i 'd like you to tell me .
-- oh , yes , determination runs in the family .
the kafka men are famous for it , you know . delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter , picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
-- i 'm flattered , of course , to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details . -- to see such determination is reward enough for me .
the < u > castle < /u > cemetery .
a man must eat -- and drink .
you work in the cemetery .
no -- not even success . my writing is not for making a living -- it 's for living . not for other people , it 's for me .
success or nothing ?
that would be even worse -- it would be a compromise .
why do you work in that hideous insurance office ? -- dealing with people who fall off ladders . now take me -- i make my living as a stone mason . it 's not my art -- but it 's the < u > tools < /u > of my art . you could be -- a journalist .
i have n't got the energy . i mean , i have to conserve my energy .
where do you get your ideas ? only joking -- i 'm just joking . let 's go to a brothel then , kafka , come on .
naturally ? -- that 's not the word i would have chosen .
these strange stories you write -- they come naturally , do they ?
-- in what sense ?
gabriela was right -- it 's easier for me to understand suicide . i 'm a practicing suicide .
the needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man . very good .
did you ?
i read the one about the penal colony .
-- in magazines nobody reads .
just what you 've published .
i do n't know what you could have read .
i 've read your stories . they 're fantastic .
yes .
are you looking for gabriela rossmann ?
i 'll commit that to memory .
when i deliver a message the very act of delivering it , you might say , gives it an official stamp , and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all .
your credibility -- yes , it 's well known .
but < u > i 'm < /u > the messenger . an error like this damages my credibility .
burgel , i thought it would be easier , as long as i was passing --
in an organization as efficient as ours , if a document once in a great while gets lost it might never be found at all .
who 's to say he ever will ? he 's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone 's toes -- in fact , i 'm the only one he trusts and he would n't even look at a document if it did n't first come through me .
he has it , he just has n't noticed it yet , all right ?
he 's usually in the storage room sorting things out . he ca n't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report .
i 've never seen him . i do n't believe there is a keeper of the files .
did you see him ?
no , i left it in his office .
you did n't give it to < u > me < /u > .
i gave it to him yesterday .
the keeper of the files is still waiting for your final summation of the erlanger claim .
and you 're late !
you 're detestable .
it 's what i 'm paid to do .
you 're just doing your job .
it 's my place to offer advice , not yours -- and by advising the chief clerk of your unpunctuality it 's certainly not my situation that 's compromised , if that 's what you 're implying .
not today , burgel . send one of your memos , write up one of your communiques , but for god 's sake do n't bother me today .
oh , do n't they ? i think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own .
say what you like -- no one pays the least attention .
good morning -- or should i say good afternoon ?
sorry , yes -- well -- thank you , sir .
the < u > orlac < /u > claim .
i see -- it 's just the erlanger claim then .
no , there 's only one report to complete . i 'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the castle today or tomorrow .
no -- i just -- i feel a sense of obligation . he was my friend -- if i can be of any help -- closing his affairs .
was there something else ?
i wonder if i might look to see if there 's an address for family -- i thought i 'd like to write to them .
i do .
excuse me , sir -- i understand you have eduard raban 's file .
you might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks .
in a small way .
i understand you fancy yourself an author .
-- yes -- raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps . he was n't here as long as you , so i did n't know him as well -- but i could see the influence he was having . i simply want you to be aware of this because you 'll be happier for it .
-- eduard --
oh , i know you got along with that poor fellow -- what was his name ?
well , i --
attitude , kafka . it does n't matter how well you do your work -- you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in .
no , sir .
have you never wondered -- and i mention this only in passing -- why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you , who have been here longer , have not ?
i did not realize it was obligatory .
it 's not healthy , kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates . at the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance .
i usually take lunch by the river .
you must make the time . where do you go off to in the lunch hour ?
to do my work well , i have little time for --
you keep too much to yourself -- you 're a lone wolf . it makes me uneasy , and if it makes me uneasy i ca n't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees .
... my ... social situation ?
you 've been with the firm for nearly nine years . you 've done your work diligently , there are no complaints on that score . but there 's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly , kafka , we eel your social situation could bear improving .
sit down , kafka .
you wanted to see me , sir .
i do . always . you understand the world better than any of us , kafka . and what it 's becoming . i 've always held you in the highest regard .
-- listen to me --
i know better than you what people will say when they have to . when they brought me in for questioning i informed on my friends the very first day .
no -- not this time .
i think you 've just escaped for the moment . just as i did . as eduard did . as they let us do . but only for the moment .
why should i believe a man who never believed me ? they 're absolutely right , you know -- guilt should never be doubted . it 's easier that way .
i told you , they 're < u > dead < /u > . it 's finished .
i know there is . and you 're what i have to bargain with . for now you 're the last one in their way .
there 's a new potion -- he said it was perfected .
i know how they reward failure . if they saw this i 'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others .
they 're dead now . we can get help .
this is the result of their elixir of youth . they were to come and check on it during the night . i contrived to miss the appointment .
i -- i found your jailer .
only two steps back ? even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that .
should i tell you why i joined our late lamented nihilists ? why i became a murderer ? because murder ... is bliss . it 's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate evil -- once you 've adopted its procedure .
gabriela ... ?
over ? it 's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit .
-- i 've just come from the castle . it 's over .
i knew you walked this way to work . i wanted to find you before they did .
gabriela ! -- you did get away .
now burgel 's one of the authorities ?
what seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you 're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that .
first these nameless authorities were the root of all evil , now it 's insignificant burgel . if indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you 're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all .
or what if there really < u > was < /u > an error ? -- i do n't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if burgel was responsible for it ? one mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion .
usually .
and burgel is the bringer of messages , is n't he ?
i 've heard of it happening .
how often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records ?
now you 're saying eduard was lured there ?
of course he is -- the castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark . people disappear up there regularly . if you want to lie in wait for someone , that 's the place to do it .
he 's jealous , yes , but < u > that < /u > jealous ? he 's too cautious .
he used to like me -- very much more than i liked him .
burgel does n't like anybody !
burgel hated eduard . and me . i 'm sure he knew about us -- and i 'm sure it drove him mad .
that street down there -- i always used to call it the approach road for suicides . it leads straight down to the bridge and the river .
it 's still easier for you to understand suicide , is n't it .
now you 've fallen into his trap . when he goes to bed at night burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him .
you might think -- i thought so myself at first -- that burgel 's too insignificant to be dangerous . but that 's the very reason to beware ! it 's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character .
i would n't put it past him .
you do n't believe that .
of course it could -- burgel 's been trying to get me thrown out as long as i can remember . < u > he < /u > could 've killed eduard .
it could n't be for that incident with burgel the other day .
they 're not obliged to tell .
why were you given notice ?
burgel ! -- i did n't leave it with him .
burgel gave me this -- what does it mean ?
i 'm collecting eduard 's things . if there 's anything you want , take it or i 'll give it to charity .
at the cost of others ? you accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony . did you go to the castle with eduard ? then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there .
yes -- which is why `` quiet , dependable people '' have to take charge of their own lives .
my only concern is the human tribunal . is n't it yours ?
you think what we 're doing is so wrong ? and what are you doing ? pursuing goodness ? for what ? to answer to some supreme tribunal ?
people must think the same of me -- a quiet , dependable person .
when you only see someone sitting at a desk all day , it 's liable to create a false impression .
i have no right to be , i know . my experience with real life is practically nil .
you 're shocked at the thought of eduard tossing a bomb through a window .
he was murdered .
and you still maintain -- what ? that he was murdered .
he was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the medical records division . apparently one of his claims was relevant .
what of it ?
the day he died , eduard was called up to the castle . did you know that ?
you strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men . and yet you 're able to remain an outsider . with the concomitant air of ... superiority ?
i 've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from .
i nominated you as a possible candidate . you were eduard 's good friend . he read me some of your work .
they 're ubiquitous . what we try to do ... is make them a little less so .
ah -- we 're back to the `` authorities '' you spoke of .
you wo n't have any trouble finding it .
-- i do n't know the musil district .
i 'm suspicious of men who want to marry . i believe they think it 's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers .
and you ... ?
eduard wanted to marry me .
last year . i -- it was broken off .
you almost married recently , did n't you ?
... all right .
there are some people i 'd like you to meet . can you come to the musil district at eight o'clock ?
tonight ?
are you free tonight ?
-- what could he have done to warrant that ?
the very fact that they 're authorities should give you reason . people will do anything to protect their own interests . for all you know he was killed at the < u > hands < /u > of the police .
when i have no reason to doubt .
and you believe everything the authorities tell you .
he was n't robbed . he was identified by his wallet .
do you think people in the new town care what happens over here ? this will always be the ghetto .
the police would know the difference , would n't they ?
eduard did n't see it as something that needed bearing .
no , i do n't . i 'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all .
two or three months , that 's all . -- i seduced him .
how long were you and eduard --
as long as it 's on their terms . if your work and your private life do n't correspond to their specifications you 're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever .
this morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving .
what 's funny ?
it 's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office .
that he was -- satisfied in that regard . i did n't want to pry .
what ?
i suspected that he -- well .
he would have . you were his best friend . a better friend than me .
no .
i was having an affair with eduard . he did n't tell you ?
yes .
well -- nice to know life exists outside the office .
have you looked ?
i 've never seen you here before .
hello again .
excuse me , i have to copy this for central docketing by 2:30 .
i 'm sorry , but i just wondered --
one of you must be mistaken .
oh -- well , i thought he once mentioned --
why would you suppose so ?
you 're a friend of eduard raban 's .
i know .
i 'm kafka -- i work upstairs in accident --
that the police may have allegiance to something other than truth .
what did she say ?
maybe it 's true then what she said .
she 's missing . i went to her house and she had n't returned there .
that 's been noted . but where does it lead us ? unless you have something more to add .
you told me to contact you if anything relevant came up -- gabriela is relevant . when i spoke to you before i did n't know she 'd been seeing eduard .
if someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away , would n't they have shut the door as quietly as possible ?
that 's not what i call conclusive evidence of an abduction .
but that 's just my point -- she was more than upset , she was livid . she slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one . i was just behind her and i did n't even hear that one < u > shut < /u > -- not at all .
-- should you happen upon anything that might be relevant .
i 'll bear that in mind .
anyway , i 'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- i wo n't say a friend , because we 're complete fencers , of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent , shall we say , an interested third party .
probably not .
... just a perception .
what makes you think so ?
he was n't a lonely man , though .
we know that .
i do n't think he really had any . he had no family either .
his landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to .
can i ask -- how you found me ?
he might have had a drink or two , despite what you think .
no , i suppose not .
grown men do n't normally fall into the river , do they ?
no . he did n't seem to be . do you think he drowned himself ?
was he depressed ?
i do n't know .
he was found in the river . could he swim ?
yes . since he came to the office , almost three years ago , we 've been quite good friends . how was eduard ...
would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close ?
well -- other departments are , yes .
engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth .
eight -- and seven months .
where you 've been employed for seven years .
-- accident and compensation association .
your office is the workmen 's --
no , we said goodbye outside the building . he went off , as usual , toward his house .
did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps ?
wednesday . we left the office together .
when was the last time you saw mr. raban ?
yes . yes , of course -- why would n't it be ?
kafka -- is that your real name ?
it 's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we 're up at the castle we suggest you do n't make a fuss . it would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects .
my assistants . i should have known . nothing is given to me . i have to acquire everything .
close only by virtue of antithesis .
still , we 're probably closer to you at the moment than any of your fellow human beings .
it 's a farce .
-- just doing our job .
for all your incompetence i was beginning to think you were at least loyal to me . you 're very good ham actors .
-- you should meet my father .
i ca n't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
what 's the matter with you ?
you mean you 've actually begun some ?
-- i was just trying to finish some work !
you mean because it 's been a while since there was a sunny day ? what a good detective you are .
i did n't realize you 'd been here that long .
we saw her naked once -- did n't we .
do you ?
the loyal civil servant . i suppose you 'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy .
oh , burgel ! gabriela was having an affair with eduard . they were both members of < u > this group < /u > . if any crime 's been discovered and people are paying for it , i 'd look to < u > yourselves < /u > !
-- gabriela , on the other hand , had made an enemy of this man burgel .
then why have n't i been --
why are you so aggressively unimaginative ? eduard is no longer the only casualty .
when a scapegoat is needed , my friend ...
-- you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful . if the discrepancy really was something big , eduard 's responsibility would still have to be small . no poor young < u > clerk < /u > could find himself in such a fix .
-- oh , yes , it 's mad .
that 's < u > mad < /u > .
that 's obvious , is n't it ? we have an opening for a new member .
... why take me into your confidence ?
as a matter of fact you 've caught us in a state of considerable excitement . our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected . it should take years off her .
what have you done with gabriela rossmann ?
-- and the new patients they bring me are n't usually as dexterous as you 've been in evading us . not perfect specimens by any means , but not the type of person who 'll be missed either .
on the contrary , it matters a great deal . we 're engaged in immensely important research here . i 'm a revolutionary too , you know -- but a much more pragmatic one .
the fact that it 's live bodies you practice your trade on does n't seem to matter to you .
lying in the gutter where they belong .
may i ask where your two warders are ?
yes , well -- we 're looking for a new village now . if we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious .
and i suppose dr. murnau did n't die in a cave-in . you killed him to free the position of orlac medical officer for your own ends .
i had the grandest of financial plots in mind , the most malevolent of personal motives , conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority i could see . and i find you . a body snatcher .
i believe we 've exceeded his expectations .
`` accident and compensation '' -- no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises .
-- if an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident -- and should he tragically die in spite of the district medical officer 's strenuous efforts to save him -- the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency .
it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being .
-- you seem amused .
you see , kafka , in all cases relating to the factory at orlac -- which is what this paper referred to -- the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is , to all intents and purposes , the same authority .
... a piece of paper ...
through a very unfortunate -- and i might add extremely rare -- mishap , a document intended for the one department was sent to the other . and for the first time -- though your friend was n't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one .
a mere slip . your friend mr. raban dealt only with claims that came < u > in < /u > , another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct ?
... a piece of paper ...
it so happens , my dear simple sir , that the head of medical records at the castle < u > is < /u > one of the directors of this firm .
i could always apply there .
we 're a medical firm , are n't we ? they go to the medical records section .
where do our records go to in the castle ?
you do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this , of course , hardly ever happens , if at all . the directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious .
what if i petitioned one of the directors ?
these laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them ?
what good are records if they 're not open for public inspection ?
of course not . only by a director of the firm . who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ?
once a file 's been sent to the caste , is it possible to recall it for review ?
is your friend 's name among them ? then he only worked on the one case . your chief will send me the final summation when he 's finished with it .
this is the cross-reference of clerks who 've worked on orlac claims ?
dr. murnau was the bravest of men . he spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain . a great loss .
i did read that . they gave him a posthumous medal .
you must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in . it would n't have been so bad , but even the medical officer for the district was killed !
all these in the last year ?
it 's a factory in the northern mountains . one of our best customers . without a proper request i 'm not obliged to do this , you understand -- but i 'll make an exception on this one occasion .
orlac is an account ?
if it was accounts you wanted why did you ask for employees ?
-- you mean my chief has it .
whenever an employee departs , shall we say , it 's up to the head of his department to requisition his file , reassign any outstanding claims , and send it off .
it 's gone out so quickly ?
why would we keep files on < u > dead < /u > employees ? all old files are sent up to the castle . do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records ?
what 's the matter ?
he 's the clerk who died last week . from the insurance department
wait a minute . `` raban ? '' where have i heard that name ?
yes . is n't it there ?
i 'm overworked as it is . `` raban '' did you say ?
i 'm not obliged to give you access , you know -- not without authorization -- but i 'll make an exception this one time .
it usually is .
`` raban '' -- that 'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet .
amerika !
amerika for us !
then that 's the place for us !
what 's to become of us now ?
it does n't matter . it 's too late for all of us .
i understand he was wounded in the lung .
they 'd drive us away . that kafka 's made things very hot for us .
we could go back to the office . explain ourselves to the chief clerk .
here too ! they 're all in a dreadful muddle !
this is filed incorrectly !
ludwig ?
oskar !
my mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip .
but your goal is so hard to reach . do you think the official network would surrender to one man ? we would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult .
-- how would < u > you < /u > like to be in a horrible situation like that ?
we 've been together too long . his personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa .
and we 're upset too .
it 's not our fault . we 're naturally nervous .
it 's not too bad working here .
we used to be in the supply section , carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them .
they keep switching us from department to department . he does n't mind because he ca n't sit still .
she went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour -- we watched her changing .
women are all you have on your mind !
gabriela rossman was here looking for you . do you know her ?
you look tired .
he ca n't sit still . just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one .
oskar .
ludwig .
now ann ...
get the hell out of here . '' !
take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig !
am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.ladies and gentlemen ! i am touching the beast !
to be quite honest , mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible .
i thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the albert hall . we 'll take out a full page ad in variety - `` the lord darrow benefit screening '' . we 'll invite the king of england - hell , we 'll get the whole royal family along ! it 'd be good for them and good for us !
miss darrow ... i 've been thinking . i would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father . it 's a great shame he was n't able to join us on this adventure . truly a wonderful man .
it 's ... lovely .
i hope it fits ... mrs denham 's a big lady .
kong is a myth , nothing but a native superstition , miss darrow . all we 're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts . now , if you 'll excuse me , i 'm trying to reduce my handicap .
can i see the map ? my father spoke of references to a beast god ...
does this look like the `` queen mary '' ? ? we do n't take passengers ! full steam ahead , captain engelhorn !
there 's no hard feelings , mr denham ! i just want to come to the island with you !
you 're outta your depth here , miss darrow !
i 'm coming onboard ! throw down a ladder !
look mr denham - you 're not welcome here . just pack up your cameras and go .
hi - carl denham . i 'm a big admirer of your work , sir . i 've loved all your discoveries . i really want to work closely with you on this incredible find . it 'll be good for you and good for me .
now now , ann ! try be to polite .
oh god , it 's that bloody yank !
all in due course , ann . our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to london .
father it 's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... organize an expedition -
father ... father !
out ! out ! all of you ! we have been issued with an exclusive permit -
these are priceless artifacts ! they 're ruining the site !
father !
photography teaches you nothing , ann ! click ! one second and you 've seen all you 're going to see . i want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... i want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy . understand the carving and you will understand the people ! that ann , is the key to archaeology .
i photographed it extensively , father .
now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i do n't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
i think you 're trying to run before you can walk , ann .
a neolithic bronze ... reminiscent of the nias island cultures ... it ' s very curious . defiantly pagan . the use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... what do you think ?
what have you got there ?
it ' s alright jack ... it ' s alright .
ann ... ann !
you 're the animals - all of you !
take to look out there ..- have you seen what he 's done ? you 're talking about a crazy animal !
he 's gon na die ! they 'll kill him !
come on , come on ! we got ta keep moving !
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him ? how could you do this ?
jack ! ... jack !
barricade the gates ! quick !
no ! do n't !
i 'm not sailing with this thing on board !
give it back !
this shit is bad luck ! do n't you understand ? you treat it like a game - two men have already died !
jack ! this is the archeological find of the century !
oh jesus ... you took it .
ann ... you 're father is dead . you have nothing to prove anymore .
but . . . we can ' t jack , i need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information .
we 're leaving .
jack !
leave it , ann .
it 's the same image - kong !
sun 's coming up ... we 've been in the fog for six hours .
there 's a light up ahead .
relax ... it was fifteen years ago . i do n't do it now .
i ca n't imagine you crying .
it 's ok.i know what you were feeling .
i want to thank you .
when this boat finally reaches jakata , i 'll be first off . you 'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day can not come soon enough . i 've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage .
i do n't know what happened to you , jack ... but i ca n't believe you were always this much of a bastard .
yeah ! life 's looking pretty damn good at the moment .
are you kidding ? ! that heap of junk will never leave the ground !
can you fly ?
i not doing this for me , jack ! it 's for my father . this is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years ! it belongs to him ! i 'm going to that island ... nothing 's going to stop me !
there 's nothing fast enough to catch that . forget it . it 's over .
where do i charter a boat ?
no !
i 'm sorry ...
value ? ... value ?
god , you 're so obnoxious ! our work happens to be of great anthropological value !
do they have him on display at the weekends ?
how dare you ? my father is the british museum 's most respected archeologist !
holy god ! the mummy walks !
tell me , mr driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down ?
you - calling me a thief ? well , that 's great , coming from a glorified grave robber ! you break into the tomb of some dead egyptian - the poor guy 's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys !
no , it 's not ok ! we 're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make !
i just wan na deal with the boss , ok ?
he 's grubbing for money , father .
oh my god ... ann ?
they ' re dead .
just take it easy . -- where are the others ?
we should never have come ! i pay you good money , only to have my life endangered . you 'll be hearing from my lawyer !
they 're stoking the boilers . as soon as we 've got some steam , we 're outta here .
well , that was a monumental waste of time ! i pay good money , only to be taken on some wild goose chase ! i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator !
i guess that answers your questions . there 's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank .
two ... maybe three .
i 'm chartering this vessel , engelhorn - how many days ?
there 's no island there . we 're wasting our time !
we need those co-ordinates -someone 's got ta get back there and jot the rest of it down
i tell you it does n't exist !
what a climax to the film - the first white men to set foot on ... `` skull island '' twentieth century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe !
look , i 've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there 's no island like that around here .
a man eater ! fantastic ! making history , herb
man eater ! ! !
that 's too bad .
we are a very modest and deeply religious people , mr denham .
y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments .
native costume ?
tell me mr ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume ?
the mountains ?
exotic lands , primitive people , dangerous animals ... that 's what the public expect from a carl denham picture ! lead us into the mountains , sir !
you are most kind . we will be proud to assist you !
and i appreciate that so much , i really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across america when they view my latest documentary sensation `` indonesia ... hell hole of the world '' . ernie hemmingway 's agreed to write the narration . we 're going out through universal ... laemmale 's promised me fifteen hundred screens .
we offer ourselves at your service , mr denham !
pleased to meet you ... hi , bow 's it going ? pleased to meet you ! hi , carl denham ... how 's it going ?
yeah .
it must have been terrifying ?
yeah .
did you fear for your life ?
nab- let 's get it over with .
are you nervous jack ?
she 's got a bit of an attitude , that girl . she 's turned down a bunch of money . too bad ... it would 've been a great angle - `` beauty and the beast '' . i must be getting old - i thought you two had something going there .
have n't seen her - not since we got back .
how about ann ? is she going with you ?
not me . thought i 'd head out west ... get into some redwood country .
i ca n't get back to the wall ! i 'll get eaten !
denham ! go back to the wall ... tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with ann !
the girl 's dead , driscoll . there 's no point continuing on .
what ?
i 'm calling a wrap . we 're heading back to the ship .
forget it , denham ... for godssake
set up the camera boys ! get a shot of me comin ' ashore !
yeah ? ... well , i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i do n't see 'em coming back for seconds !
they were just tasting the berries .
) they are now .
hey ! i thought these things were supposed to be extinct !
kong ...
that 's your monkey , denham .
holy shit ! look at the size of that !
you better not slow us down , denham !
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act ! it 's gon na be good for you and good for me !
listen buddy ! cut the crap ! we 're looking for ann , not making a goddamn movie !
an ape ... some kind of ape .
what was it , jack ?
yeah , i saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal .
did you see her ?
what 's compassion , mister .
compassion .
what 's that ?
coz of something i lost .
why ?
yeah .
are you gon na start it up ?
did he come around often ?
what about him ? yes .
arlyn , just tell me , did jane have a dumper , one of her regular johns ?
please , if he sees you , he wo n't come !
honey , a couple of years ago , with jane and frankie ? -- jane sent me a dumper --
ca n't you see i 'm strung out ? please , we 're waiting for it -- he 's got to have it !
arlyn , he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about .
bree -- honey - please , we 're waiting for someone .
well she 's not now . i did everything for arlyn . i loved arlyn i took her right into my apartment , my own sweet apartment on first . but she would n't stay off it -- the junk -- and i wept and i pleaded and i held her in my arms - and she started taking things , my things , and selling them for horse . my clothes . we could 've had everything together , everything -- and then the bitch sold my mink !
she was with you after she left frank .
why ? she 's a junkie .
trina honey , he just wants to find arlyn page .
oh you 've got to . he does such fun things with imagery . and i 've been reading the fall -- -- the fall by ahlbair camoo -- it 's the same thing , you know the imagery --
uh uh .
oh yes mr. klute -- wo n't you both join me ? and how do you like our fair city ? there 's so much here do n't you think ? the museums and the books and the foreign films -- bree , have you seen the godard film ?
trina this is klute . i told you about him .
and nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but i felt it stirring inside me , this -- this wild , pagan feeling --
yes ?
not young ; he was n't young -- gray at the temples , he -- well actually he looked like you .
please --
-- may i ? it 's so --
and then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well i just saw him . a stranger -- looking at me -- and i knew suddenly that all my life i 'd been --
mm .
and cannes was quite fun , quite ; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
yes ?
well -- well i 'm just back . and -- i must tell you -- something quite wonderful .
sure dear , yes .
it 's good to see you . well -- could we do it first and then just talk ?
enjoy . well --
i said that . well , so you have a choice . you can either feel lonely -- you know , the hate -- or -- so you take a call and go to a hotel room and there 's some john you 've never seen before , but he wants you . he must , he 's paying for it . and usually they 're nervous and that 's all right , too , because you 're not ; you know this thing . and then for a while , boy , they really pay attention , you 're all there is . and it 's not real and you do n't have to even like them -- you can even hate them , it 's all right , it safe -- you know ?
did n't want you .
the truth is i hate them : they must hate me . all right , the money . all right , not the money . a kind of put-on . it gets things back together . well let 's say i 'd go to one of these cattle-calls , a tryout . i mean before -- before i got this job -- and they 'd always say thank you very much and i 'd feel , you know , brought down . they did n't want me .
you think people hate you .
well it 's more than loneliness . hate . people hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know ? i 'm all screwed up .
sorry .
do you always have to repeat ?
do n't belong ?
all right . loneliness . well -- separated . from other people . forgotten . well , as if i can be here , i can go through the motions , right ? but the truth is , i do n't belong .
you 've spent your life avoiding this . you 'll try hard to deny it ; you 're quite likely to destroy it .
i do not love him .
maybe this was n't just a trick . maybe you 're in danger of real love , real involve --
guess !
i 'd just be guessing .
i know : it 's ridiculous . but it 's tearing me up and i do n't know why . and look , all right , i came here did n't i ? and if i have to , i 'll keep coming here , the works , and talk about my mummy and my daddy and i 'll even pay for it , but will you kindly for god 's sakes say something ?
well i 'm certain doctor spangler will want to talk with you ; excuse me .
look . i almost killed my -- i almost killed someone .
yes indeed .
look -- could i use your phone ?
well i have to close up now .
no .
-- i have to close up now . leave your name and number with his message service , mrs. daniel , and why do n't you just go home and wait until he --
grunemann ? i 've looked at him a --
like for you to look for the man .
oh no .
here please .
i do n't have to look at anything . i do n't have --
from the beginning i do n't know why the hell he 's messin with you . if he was me he 'd know better . if he was even a city boy he 'd know better . you 're a whore miss daniel , that 's the truth of it , right ? now somethin i 'd like you to look at .
is that what he set me up for ? everything he 's told me from the beginning ? -- do n't worry , do n't --
no , that 's not --
what was better ? i made better bait ?
i guess he figured it was better .
is that why klute did n't tell me ?
we do n't want to just lock him up ; we want a conviction , we wanted him to do something more .
why is n't he locked up ?
well we 're pretty --
you said someone killed them , you said you know who , you said that .
now there 's a picture i 'd like you to --
arlyn and jane commited suicide . he said they commited suicide .
no , not grunemann . he 's dead . the man that killed him -- also prob'ly jane mckenna , also arlyn page .
so do i .
a few more days . we know who did this .
oh well that should n't take you more than another , oh , two and a half or three years , should it ?
miss daniel , be sensible , you find another place till we get things cleaned up .
tell me . i 'll listen . i just want you to tell me .
oh no , i do n't think --
i said yes , i see .
excuse me miss daniel ?
i 'm sorry , i 'm just frightened . yes .
tom grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together , he discovered me with jane mckenna . then i suppose it was the -- the contempt i saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he 'd use it against me . within the company . i endured that as long as i could , do you see ?
if you 'll let me go i could tell them what --
it puzzles me so badly . i 've done terrible things but i ca n't consider myself a terrible man . i 've killed three people and i 'd still want to say it was accident , do you see ?
will you let me go then ?
i 'm not going to hurt you , absolutely , i 'm not .
then it does n't matter what i do any more , does it ?
yes .
no , you 're frightened , you 're pretending . well -- klute knows about me then . does everybody know , can you tell me ?
yes -- jane mckenna 's book -- i could make a phone call .
you have no idea what i 'm talking about .
all right , then , an ordinary matter . i 'm a quite well off man , i have a -- position to respect . i would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman , i 'm sure you understand . do you ? well i 'd like to buy jane mckenna 's book .
-- yes .
-- we can talk --
yes -- all right --
ca n't we talk together reasonably , just -- ordinarily ? i know you 're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior , but believe me -- do you believe me ? --
no . i 'm sore .
can i carry something for you , to the car ? will you kiss me ?
can you use these ?
you do n't believe that either , do you ? why ca n't you see my side ?
ok .
look , why should it be yes or no ? ca n't we keep it going and see ? i mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see . people do that , that 's realistic .
does n't scare me . i think we could handle it .
what ?
they do n't scare me any more .
how can you not think so ? you know the things i can do .
i do n't think so .
look at me . i 'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned , and dear god i 'd tear your heart out !
about what ?
look -- yes . i mean thanks , but -- do n't you think we better be realistic ?
you could at least look at me !
i am .
you wanted to , or you are ?
no . i was going to come up . i wanted to ask you to marry me .
well suppose i had n't come downstairs . would you just have folded up and sneaked away ?
mm .
you 're going back ?
mm .
oh . well it was n't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy .
i got a call from ross this morning . cable owned a plot of woodland -- he 'd go there on weekends . they found tom grunemann 's body buried there . they 've notified his wife .
trask said i should move . let 's not make a thing of it .
please . i said i do n't want you to do this .
trask wants to talk with you .
hey -- look officer -- i can explain everything . it was just -- you know , everything all of a --
because i did n't want to be touched ! i did n't think you 'd get that !
why could n't you stay here with me ?
how do you know how bad it was ?
bree , what 's actually happened ? it was n't that bad .
maybe i was n't there when you called .
i called trina .
with trina .
where 'd you spend last night ?
oh zippidy-doo , they 'll find my fingerprints . can i go in ? i need some stuff .
those were police laboratory people , they 've been over the apartment .
ah , schmendrick -- what 's the scam ?
you said it was over , right ? you said not to worry any more , all over , right ?
go down in my room .
right back at the start , right ?
bree --
my god , i thought it was over . and here i am , daddy , right back at the start .
listen to me : it 's all right . i 've been expecting something .
drop it .
oh look what he did in them .
do n't touch anything .
oh jesus . oh jesus .
hell there 's nothing so mysterious about the square life .
i was wondering what that was .
you and i -- a relationship .
what ?
spangler says we have a relationship .
well , i told him i would n't - uh - go there any more . i know it 's tough to understand , but it was n't easy . you see , he was nice to me . i mean , it was n't just him . i got something out of it too i guess . anyway , i told him i would n't go there anymore .
what am i supposed to say ?
is that all you have to say ?
yeah .
i saw mr. faber . you remember mr. faber , do n't you ?
yup .
oh boy , say , you think you 're pretty good .
no , not just 'mm ' . you do n't know what i --
mm .
i am scared . the things i do . the things i could do to you .
my bed .
i 'm still scared . i mean different but still . look , i made it very clear from the start , you 're a yokel , you do n't excite me , you do n't even interest me , and so i only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed ?
i do n't like getting splashed .
no . well all right . but you want to and i want you to and we both know it and all right .
we did this before .
please .
you get the christ out ! you dumb stupid bastard , you do n't know anything , you square , you get out ! i do n't have to show you anything ; you get out !
no , you can find some other way . explain it to me . bree , show me any sense to --
arlyn was a junkie ; i 'm not on junk !
no , no you 're right , i 'm sorry . he uses women ; he lets them kill themselves . is that how you want it ?
no .
you 're right , i do n't understand . explain it to me . you were scared . arlyn page , that scared you . well it should ; that 's death . so what did you do , you ran straight for it , death . ligourin kills women .
i told you before , you would n't understand .
ligourin : how could you do it ?
i do n't get you .
how can you do it to yourself ?
what if i go out on tricks - you wan na come along ? you could sit and read the national geographic .
just let me know when you are going out and where --
why ?
the next few weeks i would like to know where you are all the time .
thanks for the jolly news . i thought maybe you 'd left town by now . you kind of just disappeared . but you boys from tuscarora have a habit of disappearing , do n't you ?
the same as jane mckenna .
how ?
i thought you ought to know , arlyn page is dead .
but if it 's someone else i do .
-- then you do n't need me .
if arlyn page is living with tom grunemann --
what the hell do you think 's the matter . i could wait for you someplace .
what 's the matter ?
do n't worry .
i can make that in a lunch break ! look , hiram , you 're sure it is n't just me ? -- you decided you liked it , after all , the other night ; you 'll hang around for seconds ?
you could help me find her . you know the people . i 'll pay you a hundred dollars .
arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she 's the one who started frank . she 's strung out now ; you wo n't find her .
then maybe arlyn page knew the dumper too .
frankie kept them in the same apartment : it cut his travel-time .
did she and jane mckenna know each other ?
arlyn page .
i 've checked the records of jane mckenna 's death -- i ca n't get anything special . but frank ligourin had another girl you said , besides mckenna and you .
when ?
you asked if there was anything more you could help me with .
well what 're you down about ? you mean because you did n't get me there ? you ca n't expect that . i mean frank , yes , he 'd get me there all the time -- but never with a john .
thanks .
what 's the matter hon ? you were great . terrific . a tiger .
oh do n't be all hypocrite . or do you really like other kicks ? is it more just having power over someone ? -- so you do n't really need to --
bree -- thanks -- i do n't want to .
so you 're not too different from him , or the chap on the roof , or tommy-baby --
mm .
ezra , i 'm lots better than you 're used to . tell me -- the other night , watching me with mr. faber -- was n't your tongue a little bit hanging out ?
not much point to this , is there ?
oh , do n't be a doo-doo .
it got lonely upstairs . there 's someone on the roof .
it 's kind of late .
goodbye .
oh . no . not that way . i 'd say it was more -- i do n't know -- -- too bad ? pathetic ?
-- us city folks ? the sin , the glitter , the wickedness ?
yeah , you got to me .
hey , but did we get to you , klute ? a little ?
well --
oh -- wait -- oh i get it . you said that just to keep me scared . so i 'd tell you everything i -- oh clever ; oh you smart , tricky hick .
no , i said what did you think .
you said it was !
and i do n't think that was tom .
what do i do meanwhile ? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me ?
try some other ways .
what 're you gon na do next ?
i do n't see anything , do you ?
is there anything more i could --
you told me what you could . i guess i 'm through with your part of it .
oh golly , oh just what i 've always dreamed of , dirty phone calls . how come ?
you said you wanted these .
i thought you were going back to the apartment .
well -- she 's dead .
it was jane mckenna who sent you the dumper .
about the dumper , did n't he tell you that ?
it did n't go anywhere . but that 's not why --
did n't he tell you what you wanted ?
no .
did you like my friend frankie ?
is that what you gave him ?
what did you expect ? frankie still has a good string , three girls . figure three hundred a week from each .
well , let 's go down and ask him .
he never told me .
do you know where he got the dumper ?
you asked me where i got that date with the dumper -- frank sent me on it .
maybe , if you tell me the things you have n't .
ca n't you get him ?
what do you think ?
well do you think it was him ?
you go see agents -- or equity calls , open casting calls . and ad agencies -- commercials -- you do n't get work , you just go around .
rounds , what are they ? -- do n't watch me , keep talking .
i go on rounds .
tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go ?
i do n't want you to look up . there 's someone on the skylight .
you 've changed your mind ? you do want to play ?
no thanks .
i thought you could trick me for those tapes . do n't you get lonely in that little green room ? or let me get you someone ; i have terrific friends , wild .
-- ok ?
what ? this ?
mm ? oh , he was my old man . we broke up .
tell me about frank ligourin .
gee i hope this does n't make my cold any worse .
ok .
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards .
-- you want to wear women 's clothes , or you get off ripping things --
-- ok --
klute , tell me , what 's your bag ? are you a talker , or a button man or a doubler , or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes , or have us watch you tinkle ? or --
what about the old gentleman the other night , mr. faber ?
look , i 'm sure this 'll amuse you too . ilia trying to get away from all that .
i have some names the police gave me . frank ligourin . will you tell me what --
you 're very square . pimps do n't get you dates , cookie ; they just take the money .
how else do you meet them ? pimps ?
how would i remember ?
is that how you met the dumper ? -- someone else gave --
most of them .
is that how you get most of your dates ? someone gives your name to someone else ?
look -- i 'm sorry -- i 've led everybody wrong . i mean yes , i get those feelings , but that 's just me , that 's just feelings . i 'm sure this will amuse you ; i 'm scared of the dark . and sometimes i get shook up , i hear people or -- well , i 'll come out in the morning and think someone 's been prying at my mailbox , or there 's a little -- trash outside my door and i wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see ? -- things other people would n't even notice . well that 's not real , it 's just nerves ; it 's got nothing to do with --
what about the other things you 've reported ? -- -- being followed on the --
just phone calls , right ? they ring , you answer , they do n't say anything , just blank . kids getting kicks . burglars looking for an empty apartment . i mean there is nothing that proves --
everything that 's happened since tom grunemann disappeared . the phone calls and the --
what about everything since ?
well could i have them back now hon ? -- those tape recordings you 've got downstairs -- ok ? -- and if you want you can have a good time and i 'll have a good time and --
i ca n't say he was anybody !
but you ca n't say that dumper was tom grunemann .
nothing . except he was n't kidding . usually it 's a fakeout , you probably know . they pretend to tie you up , and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you -- hell it 's their money . i 'll hang from the shower rod and whistle maytime . except this guy was really tripped out on it ; he --
what ? what do you remember about that -- dumper ?
you remind me of my uncle .
all right , yes , i had been . those sick , wild letters -- i 'm watching you , gon na follow you , gon na punish you , kill you et cetera . well , they said , all right that 's grunemann . so try to remember when you and he - when -- well i do n't know , there was that dumper once , he sounded like that dumper -- dumpers ; they get their kicks beating you up . a man hired me once , then tried to really kill me - that 'd be about two years ago .
-- tuscarora --
a name . grunemann . nothing . and they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing . then they asked me , well had i been getting letters , from someone out there in cabbageville --
is n't that sweet . well it could be any one of them bubi ; i get to see them all .
company outing or picnic or something like that .
or you 'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean ; another month with the bull-dykes .
could i ask some questions ?
if i was taking calls full time would i be living in this kip ? i 'd be back on park avenue ; i could support the whole national guard !
no , i 'm look --
is it the shakedown hon ? you picked a loser , i just do n't have it .
mm .
and you just want to ask me a few questions ?
mm .
you 're not police or fbi ; you 're just a private investigator ?
dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun ?
will you let me ask you some questions ?
honest ?
you know what i 'm talking about . miss daniel .
why ?
he was a research engineer at the tuscarora laboratories in pennsylvania . he disappeared from there last april . i 've been hired to look for him .
gee .
tom grunemann . he wrote you some letters .
who ?
i 'm an investigator . i 'd like to ask you some questions about tom grunemann .
you said that .
my name 's john klute .
what about ?
miss daniel ? my name is klute -- john klute --
what is it ?
tomorrow . see you tomorrow night .
well --
no , i 'd -- like to be in on it .
just send me a money order .
suppose i meet you there a half hour before .
tomorrow evening , nine . east river drive and 73rd street .
i can talk it over ; possibly i can get the money . when are you meeting the man ?
all right , but i 'm going to see that list .
klute , the company 's interest is tom grunemann . solely and exclusively . you say you ca n't find tom ; all right , i 'll see that you 're paid off ; the case is closed .
it probably has the dumper 's name . it might give us some kind of new lead . i want a look at it anyhow .
no . it 's ridiculous . this has nothing to do with tom grunemann .
will the company put up five hundred dollars to get jane mckenna 's list of clients ?
i ca n't follow you .
i 'm meeting a man tomorrow night . he wants to meet me on east-river drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book . can you get that for me pete ?
you were hired to look for tom .
call-girls generally keep a book , you know , a list of their clients . sometimes , if a girl retires , she 'll even sell it worth good money . jane mckenna had a black book ; when she died it was stolen . i 've been after it a long time .
what ?
pete , i 've got a chance to buy jane mckenna 's black book .
you were hired to look for tom , not someone .
someone 's been doing all these things .
you said he was no possible connection with tom . the page girl told you that , not tom .
dumper , the man bree daniel mentioned and arlyn page knew and jane mckenna knew .
that who ?
not too bad . this brings back that dumper in the picture .
you must be discouraged .
no . no mistake pete . it does n't prove who it was -- but proves it was n't tom .
some mistake perhaps that --
not tom . whoever it was left a kind of souvenir , i told you , in her clothing . semen . the laboratory got a blood group reading from that . the man was blood type 0 ; tom was an ab .
it has to be tom . you said he ripped up his own pictures , he --
it was n't tom that broke in the room .
i 'm sorry . i do n't understand .
yeah . it was n't tom .
you said trask was arranging laboratory work . police laboratory . anything from that ?
yeah , two things pete , that --
i 'm on my way to chicago . very important meeting tonight . well -- any new developments ?
yeah .
i 've been up country , you know my summer place , my camp . i do n't even have a telephone there . this morning they sent a messenger out , that you 'd been trying to call me .
well as a matter of --
i read your report . i had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase , tom being nowhere around --
well there 's a couple --
sorry we had to meet here . but i 'm pressed for time .
i think you 're homesick . i 'll be out at my camp over the weekend . nice right now , that touch of fall in the air , that skim of frost in the early mornings , very peaceful . john , i 'll be back here again thursday ; i 'll be in touch . lieutenant , thank you .
how is it back there ?
i 'm flying back out to pennsylvania friday ; i 'll fill them in on things .
it 's got to make sense some way .
you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer . not tom , you said , the dumper was clearly not tom .
i could try arlyn page again . she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel .
where , how ?
i better keep looking .
then , close the case .
it 's where it does n't get me . i 've got nothing left that connects to anything .
all right , suppose it was n't tom grunemann ; where does that get you ?
i believed her , pete .
she would n't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict .
goodbye , pete .
thank you . goodbye , john .
all right .
all right . all right -- john , just sit tight will you ? i 'll read your report , i 'll discuss it with the others . i 'll be back next thursday , we 'll talk the whole thing over then . nothing til thursday , all right ?
i wanted to give it to you first .
do they have the report ? have you discussed it with them ?
it 's in the report .
have you discussed this with them ?
no . they never did , really . but that 's what i 'm going to recommend . the next step . unless something --
i 'm sure the fbi and the police explored that possibility .
i think tom grunemann 's dead . i 've been a lot of places - i 've asked a lot of people . i 've found no proof he 's around . i 've found no proof he was ever around .
what 's in it ?
would you like to know what 's in it ? the report .
it 's not so bad .
it 's a beautiful day in tuscarora - i do n't envy you that humidity in the city .
i 'll be sending you on a report tonight .
john , how are you ?
would i be telling you all this ? she copped out long ago . she committed suicide baxter .
i 'd like to talk with jane mckenna .
you do n't tell them . that one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them ? peace in the family . beyond that , i do n't know . all she wrote .
why did n't you tell bree , afterwards ?
ok and one of them jane mckenna -- she blows a little jealous of bree - you know ? -- bree comes first ? and evidently she knew the freak -- - that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to bree , you know , so bree 'd get hurt . i did n't know . till afterwards .
she told me .
ok , a family matter . between the girls . i had two other cows -- -- two other girls besides bree .
look -- dad -- i may stand better with the cops than you .
they tell me you use narcotics . could i bring someone around to look at your arms ?
two years ago ? sorry .
i 'm looking for a man . tom grunemann . bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago . she says you sent her on it .
i 'd like to make something clear . i do n't go after a girl ; a girl comes to me . her choice . right ?
i 've just got a few --
i 've always respected bree . i 'd like to make something clear .
oh sure they try . the idea of a better life . but they do n't really know much about life : they get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle . the trick . the trick . men in bed . not men in general , not life , not love , not even real sex -- it avoids all that . just the trick , the transaction .
i think she 's trying that .
no . she had every good intention of it -- coming to me as a private patient , getting out of the life , devoting herself to an acting career .
has she talked with you since prison ?
about his letters -- that 's all she remembered . quite violent material , i 'd say , obsessive , a quite sick man . but that 's not unusual either .
did she talk about him to you ?
not unusual .
i want to know how tom grunemann got mixed up in it .
-- usual case history -- this is n't a medical confidence , it 's all of them -- broken family , lonely , confused , crummy childhood , early promiscuity , formal prostitution beginning in her teens , income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year . oh they do n't keep the money : they get rid of it , they get pimps . why ? why do you want to know all this ?
he called this morning from tuscarora . asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport . he 's on his way to chicago .
sounds to me you better shake him again . put him in a spot he has to do something more -- but this time give him a time and a place to do it .
what about grunemann 's letters to the girl , everything like that ?
because he knew i could n't leave the case alone . and this way at least he 'd keep track of it . and me .
but if cable killed grunemann why would he get you hired to look for grunemann ?
examine this letter please . we recovered that from the shredder -- the plant disposal and incinerator system . grunemann apparently typed it friday , before he left , decided not to send it , tossed it away . we 've already contacted the new york police ; they think they know the girl in question .
no .
did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york ?
everybody 's got some , i guess .
marital problems in general ? indicates possibly -- am i right sergeant ?
no .
did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed ? -- indicates no -- did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here ? indicates no . moral or sexual problems or peculiarities ? --
no .
can you account for his disappearance in any way ?
we grew up together . kids .
you knew the subject thomas grunemann . how well ?
i know tom grunemann .
then how are you involved ?
town police .
are you with plant security , sergeant ?
klute . with a k. k - l - u -
if we get anything from the lab , we 'll have it by noon . and just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter .
nobody 's seen that .
it 's damn lucky you did n't have the dossier on cable here .
i left them here . i was doing some work here .
gov , want to leave me that one . how come he got to play with this one , anyway .
i do n't believe tom 's alive .
we have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior , but there 's no evidence of murder - there 's not even a body .
i never could believe that tom was a split personality . i never believed he was a dumper ; and i do n't believe he disappeared of his own volition ; and i do n't believe he 's alive .
what else do you know ?
i knew tom never wrote that letter .
unless he was involved with grunemann 's disappearance .
but what reason could he have ? what possible reason ?
thought it might . it 's off an arrest report you typed two years ago . man you wanted samples of everybody .
i do n't know . it looks familiar to me .
think this is our guy ?
yeah .
well ?
i looked it up .
that 's how the other one died , you know . in the water .
i believed her : the dumper was not tom grunemann .
he 's right you know . waiting for the pusher , she 'd tell you anything .
unknown , unidentified and unwanted . and there 's more every day man , there 's more everyday .
that 's a lot of people to die unknown .
mr. streiger , speaking frankly -- we 've appreciated the sergeant 's interest you know , all along . here , locally . but new york , that 's - well --
we 'd expect him to work in cooperation with you . he 'd report to each of you and to our company 's new york office , to pete -- pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth , and --
yes sir , we know he --
klute knew tom . he has a great many ideas about the case --
klute offered us his services ; we 've accepted .
private investigation , you mean . yes sir , of course you 're entitled , and there 's some very competent --
inspector we understand your position ; ours is a little different . we have an investment in tom grunemann . the company has an investment , and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves .
the subject got emotionallv disturbed ; he just dropped out . there 's thousands .
trask --
why could n't you ever find out anything from the girl ?
no sir , we do n't state that . we 're countin --
are you closing the case ?
very well , i 'd like to see him if i may .
the prospect of losing my child .
what does ?
not particularly .
does that distress you ?
doctor , i attempt to conduct my social life discreetly . at the moment i am seeing no one .
mr. kramer , do you ever have sex in here with anyone ?
good . i 'll see him in there .
he 's in his room , playing .
where is the child ?
oh , yes . wo n't you come in .
i 'm dr. alvarez , judge atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet .
yes ?
mr. kramer ?
my daddy does n't hit me , silly . why would my daddy hit me ?
in real life when does he hit you ?
he hits me on the planet kriptarium , when i steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory .
tell me , does your daddy ever hit you ?
playing .
what do you like best about your daddy ?
lunch in a restaurant .
what do you like best about her ?
do you like to be with your mommy ?
oh , sure . here , this can be mommy .
what about your mommy ?
that 's kim ... and this one 's thelma and that 's mrs. willewska and this is daddy and that 's batman and over there is robin .
i see you have people there . what are their names ?
no . but i 've been to brooklyn .
detroit .
what do you have here , billy ?
on earth .
on earth .
show ...
show .
greatest ...
greatest .
welcome to the ...
welcome to the greatest show on earth .
ladies and gentlemen ...
ladies and gentlemen ...
will you come and say good-night to me every night ?
your mom knows all about the face , okay ? do n't worry , she 'll tell the face to beat it .
daddy , what if the face comes when i 'm at mommy 's ?
your mom .
who will read me my stories ?
i 'll send your toys there and i 'm sure you 'll get some new ones .
where will my toys be ?
at your mom 's . she 'll have a bed for you in your own room .
where will my bed be , where will i sleep ?
what do n't you understand , pal ?
i do n't understand , daddy .
bigger than a principal . the judge sits in robes in a big chair.. the judge has thought a lot about us , about you and me and your mom , and he has decided ... ... he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom joanna in her apartment . and i 'm very lucky . because even though you 'll live with your mom joanna i 'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month .
like a principal ?
because ... well , that 's what he does . he 's a very powerful man .
why does he decide ?
billy , sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced , there 's a discussion about who the child should live with , the mother or the father . now there is a man who is very wise . he 's called a judge . and a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with .
no , son , i did n't get fired . i 'll tell you what we 'll do , okay ? how about if we go to a burger king and then we watch a little t.v . and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow . just you and me ... how 'bout that ?
daddy ! you 're home early . did you get fired again ?
what else was n't there ?
uh , uh . there was no such a thing as burger king .
was there burger king ?
yeah , there was apple juice .
was there apple juice when you were little ?
uh , uh ... we did n't have television then .
did you watch `` i dream of jeannie ? ''
i guess about the same kind of things you do .
what did you do when you were little ?
uh , huh ?
mom -- i mean , dad ?
boy , i bet you if mommy ever saw this she 'd remarried you .
no , son . daddy and mommy will never get remarried .
no .
are you going to remarried phyllis ?
i do n't know . i had n't thought much about it .
are you going to get remarried ?
no , she never did .
did mommy ever see this ?
sure .
wow ! that 's neat . can i sit in it ?
uh huh ...
is that really your chair ?
yep .
is this really your desk ?
you like it ?
wow !

goodbye .
i 'm sorry , pal , but i had a meeting and --
you 're late .
you got a letter from mom .
uh , huh ...
i 'll call thelma and remind her , okay ? do n't worry .
what if she forgets ?
no . if i 'm not here , you go home with thelma and kim .
will she pick me up after school ?
soon . i told you before , very soon .
when is mommy coming back ?
right . one o.j . coming up .
what about my orange juice ?
that 's right . you 're absolutely right ... it 's been a long time since i made french toast .
you forgot the milk .
sure . did n't i ever tell you french toast was my specialty ? i 'll bet i never told you that . now then , the first thing we need is ... ... eggs ! right ?
wow ! french toast , really ?
i 'll tell you what , kiddo -- why do n't i fix us some french toast ?
soon . very soon .
when is mommy coming back ?
oh , christ ... ah , yeah ... you want to know why mom 's not here , right ?
the little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine . where is mommy ?
huh ? ... oh god ... what time is it ?
then i have concluded my questions .
no , counselor , i 'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning .
does the witness deny the injury took place ?
this is an isolated incident , counselor , unless you can prove otherwise .
i do not , your honor , however --
i see . well , you 'll have to do better than that . do you have any affidavits to support negligence ?
yes , your honor .
are you introducing the question of negligence here , counselor ?
mr. kramer , is n't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago ?
sustained .
overruled .
objection !
sustained .
objection ! i must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness .
overruled . the witness will answer , please .
objection !
mrs. kramer , can you tell the court why you are asking for custody ?
because my son is here . and his father is here . as a mother , i do n't want my child to be separated from his father .
mr. kramer , why did you set up residence in new york ?
your honor , i would like to place in evidence a report on mrs. kramer 's therapy by her therapist , dr. elinore freedman of la jolla , california .
yes ... look , during the last five years we were married , i had ... i was getting more and more ... unhappy , more and more frustrated . i needed to talk to somebody . i needed to find out if it was me , if i was going crazy or what . but every time i turned to ted -- my ex-husband , he could n't handle it . he became very ... i do n't know , very threatened . i mean , when- ever i would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack . anyway , we became more and more separate ... more and more isolated from one another . finally , i had no other choice , i had to leave . and because of my ex-husband 's attitude -- his unwillingness to deal with my feelings , i had come to have almost no self- esteem ... at the time i left , i sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me -- that my son would be better off without me . it was only when i got to california and started into therapy i began to realize i was n't a terrible person . and that just because i needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child , that did n't make me unfit to be a mother .
and yet you chose to leave him ?
yes . very much .
mrs. kramer , do you love your child ?
i make thirty-one thousand dollars a year .
and what is your present salary ?
yes , i work for jantzen as a sportswear designer .
tell me , mrs. kramer , are you employed at the present time ?
yes . i tried to talk to ted -- my ex-husband -- about it , but he would n't listen . he refuses to discuss it in any serious way . i remember one time he said i probably could n't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for billy .
did you wish to ?
no , i did not .
mrs. kramer , did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband ?
the first couple , yes , but after that it became increasingly difficult .
and would you describe those years as happy ?
six years .
now then , mrs. kramer , would you tell the court how long you were married ?
while the child was in the care of the witness , he cut his face badly and is now scarred .
objection ! your honor , counsel is raising a question that is not germane to these proceedings .
your honor , i 'm only examining the man 's employment record . he pretends to fitness when he can not hold a job .
objection , your honor ! counsel is harassing the witness .
objection !
so do i .
no questions .
no further questions . thank you mrs. phillips .
can you recall any particular incident that relates to mr. kramer 's care of his child ?
objection , your honor . the answer is , to be generous , very vague .
your honor , i 'd like to ask what this model of stability and respectability has ever succeeded at ? mrs. kramer , were you a failure at the longest , most important personal relationship in your life ?
objection !
objection !
mrs. kramer , how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult ?
your honor , i would request a direct answer to a direct question . does she have a lover ?
objection !
how long do you plan to live in new york , mrs. kramer ?
objection .
thank you . i have no further questions .
ted was a good worker . but , ah ... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own , things started to change . look , i know he had problems , i understand that . i 've got problems , everybody 's got problems . but i 've got a shop to run , i ca n't let that kind of thing get in the way ... i guess i felt that ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office .
and yet you fired him .
it was good . he was a hard worker , a lot of drive , a real hustler .
and how did you find his work ?
yes ...
and did you have a close personal relationship ?
eight , almost nine years .
now then , mr. o'connor , how long did ted kramer work for you ?
my , we are a hot shot are n't we ?
either you call and set up the appointment , or i 'll call . and if i call , you lose the commission .
mis-ter kramer , it 's ... ... almost four now . it 's the friday before christmas . nobody is going to want to --
call up the people at j. walter thompson . set up an appointment at four .
there might be something at j. walter thompson . but ... ... i do n't think they 're really serious . the position 's been open for two months and ... they may just be on a fishing expedition . i 'm sure you 'll be much happier if you wait until after the first --
i understand and i 'm absolutely sure something wonderful will turn up ... . ... after the first of the year .
look , you do n't understand . i need a job . i 've got a kid and --
mr. kramer , nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their christmas bonus .
what ? ! what do you mean , i do n't understand .
ummm , hmmm ... umm , hmmm ... well , this looks very good.. of course ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job .
yes .
were you ?
congratulations , mrs. kramer . you have just rewritten matrimonial law . you were both divorced , mrs. kramer .
i consider it less my failure than his .
oh ? what do you call it then -- a success ? the marriage ended in divorce .
i was not a failure .
so , you were a failure at the longest , most important relationship in your life .
we were married two years before the baby . and then four very difficult years .
how long was that ?
yes .
would you speak up , mrs. kramer ? i could n't hear you .
i suppose ...
whom you 've seen twice in a year ? mrs. kramer , your ex-husband , was n't he the longest personal relationship in your life ?
then , we do n't really know , do we , when you say `` permanently '' if you 're planning to remain in new york , or even to keep the child for that matter , since you 've never really done anything in your life that was continuing , stable , that could be regarded as permanent .
i ... i do n't know ...
is that ... permanent ?
do you have a lover now ?
somewhere in between .
more than three , less than thirty- three -- permanently ?
i do n't recall .
how many lovers have you had -- permanently ?
i do n't recall .
well , i can certainly understand why you left him .
no .
did he ever fail to provide for you ?
no .
was he unfaithful ?
no .
a heavy drinker ?
no .
would you describe your husband as an alcoholic ?
no .
did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way ?
no .
in all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way .
yes .
now then , mrs. kramer , you said you were married seven years . is that correct ?
beautiful .
okay ... i think i 'll go talk to my son now . how do i look ?
no more waiting in coffee shops ... i promise .
only can i still see him ?
oh , god ... oh , my god ...
he 's already got one mother , he does n't need two ... he 's yours ... i wo n't fight you for him any more . he 's yours ...
what ?
after i left ... when i was in california , i began to think , what kind of mother was i that i could walk out on my own child . it got to where i could n't tell anybody about billy -- i could n't stand that look in their faces when i said he was n't living with me . finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to billy and to me and to the world how much i loved him ... and i did ... and i won . only ... it was just another `` should . '' ... sitting in that courtroom . hearing everything you did , everything you went through ... something happened . i guess it does n't matter how much i love him , or how much you love him . i guess it 's like you said , the only thing that counts is what 's best for billy . i do n't know , maybe that 's all love is anyway ... ted , i think billy should stay with you ...
please ... please do n't stop me . this is the hardest thing i 've ever had to do..
joanna , what the hell is --
ted , when we got married it was because i was twenty-seven years old and i thought i should get married and ... when i had billy it was because i thought i should have a baby ... and i guess all i did was mess up my life and your life and --
ted , do you love him ?
goddamnit , joanna . what the --
ted , do you love him ?
okay , i 'm here . now why did you --
i 'm not interested , joanna . goodbye .
please , ted . i never would have brought it up if i thought --
yeah , well he did , did n't he .
i 'm sorry ... i just mentioned it in passing . i never thought he 'd use it .
joanna , go fuck yourself !
ted , if you ca n't discuss this rationally --
joanna , go be a mother . get married , have kids . do n't get married , have kids . do whatever you want . i do n't give a damn . just leave me out of it -- and leave my baby out of it .
such as ?
ted , all my life i 'd either been somebody 's daughter or somebody 's wife , or somebody else 's mother . then all of a sudden , i was a thirty-two-year-old , highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child . i went to california because that was about as far away as i could get . only ... i guess it was n't far enough . so i started going to a shrink . ted , i 've had time to think . i 've been through some changes . i 've learned a lot about myself .
joanna , i do n't give a --
ted , listen to me ... you and i , we had a really crappy marriage -- look , do n't get so defensive , okay ? it was probably as much my fault as it was yours ... anyway when i left i was really screwed up --
are you out of your mind ? ! you 're the one that walked out on him , remember ?
i want my son . i 'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street . i want my son .
you want what ? !
ted ... the reason i wanted to see you ... i want billy back .
you 've been living here , in the city ?
watching my son ... ted , i 've been living in new york for the past two months .
he is ... you sat in that coffee shop across from school --
he looks like a terrific kid .
a few times . sometimes i sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school .
you have ?
i 've seen him .
you ca n't tell it from a distance , ted .
i ca n't help but feel somehow ... it 's my fault . i keep thinking i could 've done something -- stopped it ...
yes ... how 's billy ?
look at us , joanna . just like any old married couple having dinner . who would believe it .
fine .
how 's the new job ?
so do you .
hello , ted . you look well .
i do n't know ...
where are you going ?
no ! ... please ... please do n't make me stay ... i swear ... if you do , sooner or later ... maybe tomorrow , maybe next week ... maybe a year from now ... i 'll go right out the window .
okay , i understand and i promise i wo n't try and stop you , but you ca n't just go ... look , come inside and talk ... just for a few minutes .
i am not ! i 'm a terrible mother ! i 'm an awful mother . i yell at him all the time . i have no patience . no ... no . he 's better off without me . ted , i 've got to go ... i 've got to go .
c'mon , joanna , you do n't mean that . you 're a terrific mother --
ted , i ca n't ... i tried ... i really tried but ... i just ca n't hack it anymore ...
what ?
i 'm not taking him with me .
what about billy ?
no you did n't . you did n't even ask about billy .
i heard you , joanna . i promise i heard you .
you just do n't get it , do you ? i - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you .
i 'm listening , joanna -- believe me , i 'm listening . my wife is walking out on me after eight years of --
ted , you 're not listening to me . it 's over , finished .
so we 've got problems . everybody 's got problems -- that 's normal --
look , it 's not your fault , okay ? it 's me . it 's my fault -- you just married the wrong person .
i 've paid the rent , the con-ed and the phone bill , so you do n't have to worry about them .
now listen , before you do something you 'll really regret you 'd better stop and think --
here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning . they 'll be ready on saturday .
joanna , whatever it is , believe me , i 'm sorry .
i took two thousand out of the savings account . that was what i had in the bank when we got married .
okay , okay ... what is it this time ? what did i do now ? ...
my american express ... my bloomingdale 's credit card ... my check book --
that represents a gross billing in excess of two million -- what ? !
ted , i 'm leaving you .
i thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the fire and ice account by revlon .
are you firing me , jim ?
disappointing . it only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum , and ... ah ... they 're not very happy and ... well , the guys have decided they want to ... ah , re-think the entire concept and ... look , i do n't like having to do this , okay ? ... but ... i mean , what i mean is ... ah , i 'm going to have to ... ah , let you go --
that 's my decision , ted and that 's final .
jim , this is garbage . this is n't anything like what we talked to revlon about . none of it . you ca n't --
well , ah ... i thought it over and i decided we 're doing it murray 's way .
all right , jim . you said i was running this show , right ? you said no decisions without my approval , right ? well what the hell is this ? what 's going on , jim ?
i do n't . jim , this is n't anything like what we talked about . it 's not even close .
murray had some ideas about the fire and ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs ... i think they 're kind of interesting .
what the hell is this ?
hey , ted . c'mon in . i wan na ' talk to you .
'night , jim .
jim , i appreciate what you 're saying . i mean it , but i really think joanna 's coming back .
ted , this may sound a little rough , but we 've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency , right ? and now it 's up to us -- that 's you and me -- to deliver the goods . ted , you 're my main man , and if i ca n't depend on you a hundred and ten percent , twenty-four hours a day , because you 're worried about a kid with a runny nose --
i do n't know , jim ...
look , it 's none of my business , so you can tell me to butt out , okay ? but if you want my advice , you 'll send billy away to stay with relatives for a while . just until you get yourself straightened out .
i do n't know , jim . this whole thing has happened so ... pow -- like that .
but ... just in case ... i mean , just on the off chance she does n't . what are you going to do about the kid ?
she 'll be back ...
i 'm going to be okay . the way i see it , joanna 'll come home , it 's just a matter of time .
look , ted , i 'm the oldest whore on the beat , okay ? three marriages , two divorces ... you 're gon na be okay .
me ? i 've never been better . i mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine .
listen , do n't let it get you down . you 're going to be fine .
you want to know the real kicker ? the real kicker is , for the first time in my life -- the first time -- i feel like a loser .
jesus christ . that 's a real blockbuster . i always figured you guys had it made .
i mean it ted , you 're running this one .
wow !
listen , ted ... i just want to tell you , when old man schmidt retires next year , i 've got a pretty
jim , i 've got to go . i 'm already late --
hey , what 's the rush ? c'mon , walk me a couple of blocks .
i do n't think so , jim . maybe i should n't have --
ted , will you take it easy ? revlon 's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this , without making us sweat . now just relax , okay ? everything 's gon na be fine .
but it 's not a year from now , is it ?
it 's a very good job -- too good to pass up . i 'll be handling funding for the whole ... look , i ... ... '' like '' you a lot . and you ... ... '' like '' me , okay ? maybe if it was a year from now , maybe things would be different ...
i 'm going to take it .
and ?
i 've been offered a job in washington with h.e.w .
yeah ?
kramer ... there 's something i ought to tell you .
now in haskins vs. haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother , thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby .
kramer --
but it does n't work that way . a major decision was handed down by the appellate court in 1969 -- in the case of haskins vs. haskins .
right .
so , naturally , you assume that since joanna left , that would be a compelling point against her , right ?
i do n't want to hear another word against him . not another word . he 's a wonderful man ... a wonderful man ...
kramer , i 'm sorry . all i was trying to do was --
no . no , i do n't believe it . jim o'connor would never let anything like that happen . he gave me my shot in this business . if it was n't for jim o'connor i 'd be -- i do n't know where i 'd be . he 's a wonderful man ...
oh , for god 's sake , kramer . you have got to be the world 's most naive human being . murray has gone in and changed every single ad you 've done on the entire fire and ice campaign . every layout ... every idea ... every single thing , right down the line .
so ... what 's so terrible about that ?
murray .
how should i know ?
i do n't believe you .
you dope . o'connor does n't give a damn about billy . all he wants is somebody that 'll hang around with him every night so he wo n't have to go home .
i ca n't . i 've got billy to take care of .
you want to know why ? i 'll tell you why ... another scotch and soda for the gentleman . i 'll tell you exactly why . because you 're not his buddy anymore . because he ca n't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him .
what ? ! ?
o'connor 's out to get you . he 's going to take the fire and ice account away from you .
kramer ...
okay , phyllis , what 's up ?
do you ?
he wanted to know if i liked fried chicken .
and ?
mmmmnph ... i 'll get you a cab ...
kramer , i 've got to go . i 've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on centre street .
yes , i 'll have dinner with you .
yes , what ?
yes .
sure .
hiya , phyllis . these are the revlon contracts . i thought you ought to check them out .
you 've got that look . my lady and i split two years ago in august and i 'm an old pro at this shit . first thing , stay away from the children 's zoo . it 's pure hell -- if i never see another chicken , i 'll be happy . i 'm here , darling . do n't worry ...
three months . how can you tell ?
tough ... ... i get off duty at five-thirty . how long you been divorced ?
i 've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill .
walk him over to bethesda fountain , buy him an ice . it 'll kill twenty minutes .
what ?
fine .
mr. lombardo from packaging wants to meet on friday .
no . uh , uh . tell him i asked for it friday . i want it friday . period .
mr. schmidt ca n't have the figures on the television buy until monday .
i know ... .i know .
mr. o'connor called . there 's a meeting with the revlon people in the board room and you 're fifteen minutes late .
do n't worry . i 'll get the money .
it 's going to cost .
i 'll take my chances .
we can appeal , but i ca n't guarantee anything .
what if i fight it ?
ordered , adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child , effective monday the 23rd of january . that the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child , four hundred dollars each month . that the father shall have the following rights of visitation : every other weekend , one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child 's vacation period . that 's it .
oh , no..
i ca n't tell you how sorry i am .
i lost him ? i lost him ?
the judge went for motherhood straight down the line .
oh , christ !
when joanna -- my ex-wife -- when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage ... well , i guess most of what she said was probably true . there were a lot of things i did n't understand -- a lot of things i would do different if i could . just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change ... but we ca n't . some things , once they are done , ca n't be undone . joanna says she loves billy . i believe she does . so do i. but the way it was explained to me , that 's not the issue . the only thing that 's supposed to matter here is what 's best for billy ... when joanna said why should n't a woman have the same ambitions as a man , i suppose she 's right . but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex ? i guess i 've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent :
mr. kramer , would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child .
do you want the kid or do n't you ?
jesus christ . did you have to be so rough on her ?
i do n't know , john ... i mean , to be brutally honest , i 'm not so sure what kind of mental shape joanna 's in right now . y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink .
look , ted , i do n't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him .
six .
good . you 've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer , mr. kramer . how old is the child ?
fine .
that 's if we win . if we lose , you could end up having to pay your wife 's court costs as well .
first , there 's no such thing as an open and shut case . especially where custody is involved . got it ?
look , she walked out on her own child , right ? that 's desertion , right ? mr. shaunessy , i 'm telling you it 's an open and shut case .
it 's beautiful . it 's just beautiful . they have a beautiful relationship .
can you describe the relationship between mr. kramer and his son ?
charley , my husband , and i are ... divorced and kim , that 's our daughter is about billy 's age and the children play together a lot . so , i guess we see each three or four times a week .
how often do you see mr. kramer and his son ?
six years . ever since ted and joanna moved into the building .
mrs. phillips , how long have you known ted kramer ?
then you do n't have a choice . have billy at the seventy- fifth street entrance to central park , saturday at ten .
no , but --
you ever see her talk to the walls ?
john , what if she kidnaps him .
she 's the mother . that means she 's within her legal rights .
what ? ! she wants what ? !
i do n't know .
how the hell are you going to do that ?
do n't worry . i plan to have something within twenty-four hours , john .
any prospects ?
yeah .
ted ? are you there ?
good christ , joanna , just get the hell out of my life .
ted , i wo n't lie to you , we do n't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you 're out of work .
john ?
oh , christ.. .john , there 's some- thing i ought to tell you . my ... ah , situation has ... changed . i lost my job .
ted ? they 've set the court date . i just heard today ... it 's ... january sixth .
fuck you . he 's my son . i 'm staying with him .
mr. kramer , there 's --
no .
now , i 'd advise you to wait outside . it 'll be eas --
ten .
how many ?
but i 'm going to have to take some stitches .
your boy is very lucky , mr. kramer . one inch over and it would have caught the eye .
please , thel ...
ted , i just heard ...
please go away , thel ... i ... i just have to be by myself for a little while ...
maybe . i said maybe . what i mean is , ah ... i do n't think it 'll really work out , but charley seems to want it , so ...
hey , that 's terrific .
you and charley ?
ah , charley and i are ... well , we 're thinking about ... i mean , actually we 're sort of talking about maybe getting back together .
uh , huh ...
ted .
any day .
you heard anything yet ?
i thought about it a lot and you 're the only person i know that i trust with him . i mean , if anything happened to me , he 'd be okay with you . you 're a good mother .
me ? ! you want me to take care of billy ? !
thel , listen to me . if , on the million to one shot that i should -- that anything should happen to me . would you take care of billy ?
do n't say that ! i do n't want to hear you say that !
i did n't say i 'm going to die , but if i should --
what ?
thelma , if i die --
i do n't mean a little favor . mean a big f favor .
sure .
he 's okay ... thel , can i ask you a favor ?
i told her you 're doing a
what d'you tell her ?
uh , huh ... yeah ...
she ever ask about me ?
uh , huh ... she said she had a good job , was playing a lot of tennis . she wanted to know all about billy .
california ?
not for a couple of months . the last time i heard from her she was living in san francisco .
thel , you ever hear from joanna ?
look , i know this is n't gon na make any sense , okay ? i mean forget the logic part ... but i keep thinking if charley really loved me , he would n't have let me divorce him .
c'mon , thel . so charley had a little fling . so what ? all in all he was a pretty good husband .
no . i do n't think so .
d'you think you and charley 'll ever get back together again ?
three . and add some basil .
how many onions does it say to use ?
no , not really ... i guess it 's different if you do n't have children , but ... i dunno , even if charley and i do n't live together , even if we 're sleeping with other people , even if charley was to marry again ... he 'd still be my husband . that stuff about `` till death do you part ? '' that 's really true .
you ever think about getting married again ?
slow down ... slow down ...
lenox hill . 77th street between park and lex . the emergency number is 327-0800 .
wait a minute ! wait a minute !
i 'm sure .
you 're sure ?
i understand .
you 're on your own , understand ?
got it .
i 've got enough trouble raising my own kid . i do n't need another one . got it ?
all right ... okay ... but let 's get something straight , right now . i mean , i 'm sorry about what happened between you and joanna , but it 's not my problem , understand ?
thelma , i 've lost my wife , i 'm not losing my child .
look , this is nothing personal , but i do n't think you can do it .
i 'm gon na keep him , why ?
i mean , what are you going to do about billy ?
i do n't know , thel ... this whole thing has happened so ... pow , like that .
what are you going to do ?
i 'd like to know what the hell kind of courage it takes to walk out on your husband and your child ?
ted , divorce is a terrible thing . i know , i went through it . you 've got to believe i did everything i could to get joanna to stay . but i 'll tell you something . you may not want to hear it , but it took a lot of courage for joanna to do what she just did .
y'know something thelma -- you are the typhoid mary of divorce . i mean it . joanna and i never had any trouble until you and charley split up .
no .
boy , you guys are really something , y'know ? i 'd like to know one thing , okay -- just one little thing . did you tell joanna she should leave me ?
maybe she did n't feel like she should have to . maybe she felt like if you 'd been paying any real attention to her to start with , maybe you would 've noticed .
then how come she never said anything like that to me ?
joanna said that ?
oh for shit 's sake , ted , you are the most selfish human being i have ever met . no wonder she said you came first , then billy , then , if there was anything left over , she got the scraps .
two . she is getting to be a real hermit or recluse or whatever it is you call it . thelma , do you know where i could be in this business if i had a wife that entertained or went out socially --
did it ever occur to you guys that joanna kramer 's not the easiest person in the world to live with ? ! did it ? ! for one thing she 's always thirty minutes late . you can set your watch by it --
what d'you know about how joanna felt ? you went off to an office every morning and you 'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell .
listen , joanna kramer 's got a goddamn good life . she 's got a husband that loves her . she 's got a terrific kid . she 's got a wonderful home --
i mean ... things . ted , joanna 's very unhappy and --
things ? what kind of things ?
ted , joanna and i used to talk a lot and ... well , she told me a lot of ... ah , things about the two of you .
hostile ? me ? thelma , i 'm not hostile . i am anything but hostile . but if you want to know what i am . i 'll tell you what i am . what i am is , i am hurt . i am very hurt . and i just want to know one thing , okay ? just one thing ... why ? that 's all i want to know ... why ?
ted , do n't be so hostile .
yeah , she said it was n't any use talking anymore .
ohmygod . did n't she say anything ? she must 've said something .
i walk in the house and before i can say `` how are you ? `` , `` did you have a nice day ? '' before i can say anything . pow she 's out the door .
ted , all i wanted to know was where --
i came home tonight . we just got the fire and ice account at the agency . do you know what that means ? ! do you understand what that means ? it means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life .
look , ted , all i --
all right , thelma , you want to know what 's going on ? i 'll tell you what 's going on . i 'll tell you exactly what 's going on .
ha ! you tell me .
ted , i do n't understand a word you 're saying . where 's joanna ?
do n't play innocent with me , thelma . you know perfectly well what 's going on .
ted , what are you talking about ? !
all right , thelma ... that 's it . i 've had it . you can call your good friend joanna kramer and tell her enough is enough , okay ? i mean , i do n't know what i did , but you can tell her she 's made her point .
huh.. .hello ?
do not worry , holiness . they fight for you . they are under your protection .
i worry about them .
khambas are wild men .
your people are very brave . they are fighting the chinese . no one can stop them . not even me .
kham , holiness .
where are you from ?
yes , holiness .
all quiet ?
yes . i am ready .
please , come , holiness .
a moment .
we must go , holiness .
i know .
and that day , your father got better . he named you lhamo . `` the protector . ''
no cried ?
you were a beautiful baby . so calm .
cow .
your father had been very ill , we thought he would die , and some animals had died .
tell me .
again ?
mama , my story .
no !
goodbye , kundun .
hmmm .
can i free the prisoners ?
i will buy them for you .
here . we 'll collect them .
where will you keep them ?
will you buy the sheep for me ?
i do , beautiful horses . thank you , holiness .
and you have horses ? you love horses .
i do , now .
are you ? of whom ?
but , i am in charge .
no .
can i do anything i want ?
not the way to talk to people .
it is alright , father .
i am sorry , lhamo .
and we will begin with tearing it down .
then , we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland .
i will not approve it .
plans for absorbing the tibetan army into the people 's army will soon be finalized .
chairman mao can keep china . just give us back tibet .
to protect . to serve you . chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now .
why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa ?
it depends on the quality . and , that it be indian .
how much tea do you drink , prime minister ?
so far , they do . but , the quantity , it does not exist . you will have to re-evaluate your needs .
the people 's liberation army pays for all food and lodging .
impossible ! you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands ! more food , the best land for your soldiers to camp .
we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed .
are you , general ?
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement .
you have cracked a man 's skull and that crack has not healed . it is too soon to expect him to be your friend .
you must also do something about the public meetings . i see this , memorandum circulating , with tibetan grievances .
good . our first request is that you allow us to build a road . you have no roads in tibet . we can discuss the plans in lhasa . when you return .
soon .
do you have plans to return soon , dalai lama ?
i have a copy for you .
i have .
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement ?
thank you . please sit .
we bring greetings from chairman mao .
general chiang .
dalai lama .
if i were to go into exile , could we expect any serious assistance , from india , suppose ?
your prime ministers , support the proposal that you return to lhasa . on the opposite hand , some officials urge you not to return . they believe you should leave now , for india .
then , we shall meet .
general chiang chin-wu , the chinese representative , is en route to dromo . he is coming to meet you .
yes .
holiness ?
yes , but they say he did .
ngabo did not have the state seal . he could not sign .
time to study .
yes .
he is a capable man .
not yet , but the governor of chamdo , ngabo jigme , suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking .
i want at all costs to avoid this . do we have news from the delegation in china ?
i am afraid .
with much bloodshed .
yes . most of the chamdo region is now in chinese hands . there is a report from chamdo which makes quite clear that , unless some settlement can soon be reached , communist troops will soon be marching on lhasa .
so , we must face china and all her might alone .
the united nations voted not to hear our appeal .
and the united nations ? surely ?
all ?
of the tibetan delegations sent abroad , all have been turned away .
we did not .
did you receive the letter ?
the tibetans were introduced as delegates from the `` chinese region of tibet '' . we protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it .
very complicated , holiness . let me tell you current news . the chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that tibet belongs to china . we sent a mission to the chinese national conference . our attendance was a grave mistake .
it is calm .
the sera monks have surrendered ?
he has been imprisoned , here in the potala , holiness .
we do not know .
who am i ?
yes , yes . your brothers are here .
this many ?
two .
how many ?
i will be back in a few days .
i miss him too .
i miss my brother .
you did . we washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father . that day the father got better . and that day , a pair of crows came to nest in our roof . i just remembered .
i pooped .
at dawn , you were born . one eye was closed , and your sister opened it with her thumb . we gave you the sweet drink .
me . first break of day .
yes . a cow had died . one night , you stopped all your moving , and i said to your sister , `` his time has come . ''
cow .
he had been sick from the time you began growing in me . we thought he would die .
your father had been very sick .
far , far away .
oh , no . where will he go ?
answer .
i need to squeeze this brain .
the causes of suffering arise from true sources . attachment , desire , envy , hatred , greed , unkindness , wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering .
i accept it . what are the causes of suffering ?
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions . birth , illness , grief , old age , poverty , pain , death -- these are surferings .
i accept it . what is suffering ?
the four noble truths , as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are : the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering , the truth of the cessation of suffering , the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering .
not until you are eighteen .
i am him .
you ca n't do anything real until you are dalai lama .
do you have money ?
what do you think ?
do i have money ?
you could buy them .
can i save the sheep from going to the market ? so they do n't die .
arrange for me to speak to the people 's leaders .
we are now accused of aiding the rebels . the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt .
i will alert the chinese delegation . you know , i would never have let you go alone , kundun .
i will not go .
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities . many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home .
the people will not allow it .
they will take lhasa next .
non-violence means co-operation when it is possible . resistance , when it is not .
the pursuit of non-violence . very difficult .
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent . they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham . it has been destroyed . women and children , trying to escape from the fighting , have been shot with machine guns , fired from airplanes .
i have always asked for plain information . just the truth .
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese .
land reform is underway in amdo . the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed . landlords are being punished .
the khamba 's gun is his most prized possession . i admire them so . they face a modern , well equipped army , and still , they fight .
i ask them to stop , to lay down their guns .
i had relinquished doubt .
did you ever doubt it ?
my first and foremost duty is to protect my people . i feel sure of this . and , things change . maybe not right away , maybe not soon . but i believe this -- things will change .
shall we consult the protective deities , holiness ?
i am scared .
tibet , at war ? no . china is close , america is far away . after countless people die , china would still , always , be close . we will work with what we have .
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war .
at this point , the most likely result of a foreign pact is war .
it is unlikely . america , perhaps . there is great anti-communist feeling in america .
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking . agreed . send ngabo . is that all ?
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa .
in the americas .
where is that ?
one country did sponsor the resolution . a land called `` el salvador '' .
the radio contact said one officer had died . then he said , `` the chinese soldiers -- they are coming . '' and then , the radio went dead .
has anyone died ?
eight thousand , five hundred , soldiers and officers . we have recently requested mortars , anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from india . we have several hundred in the area .
what is the size of our army , now ?
i shall send a letter to america , to the president , informing him of our problem .
quite simple . yes . good .
ask the chinese mission to leave our country . immediately .
america , we shall see .
and , america ?
britain chooses not to .
britain ?
india is a newly independent nation . they are struggling . india is in no position to help us .
can india help us ?
yes . as a free country . but our attempts have proven futile . we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese .
so , tibet , too , needs to define itself .
the war is over . this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves .
what is the danger from the chinese , now ?
ask whatever you will .
i need to know what you know . i am no longer a child .
you are the man who wrote this letter . you are the man who has come back to lead us . you will soon have great responsibilities . you must know what to do .
what can i do ? i am only a boy .
look here !
i am sorry for you to have to witness this , kundun .
when it is time .
tell me .
he warned about the future of tibet .
what was the warning of the thirteenth dalai lama ?
i do not know , holiness .
where is alsace ?
it is an island . american territory .
in the pacific ocean .
will we ever be in war ?
no . this war is almost over .
will we be in this war ?
the regent is adding men . and he bought rifles and ammunition from india . mountain guns , too .
no . not very big .
is that big ?
roughly five thousand men .
how big is tibet 's army ?
please .
may i listen to the news with you , holiness ?
thank you .
of course , please , this way . your servant may use the kitchen .
we are traveling to lhasa . may we ... ?
please , come in , so cold .
good day .
good day .
always .
you have a lot to learn about organization . how to draw out people 's opinions . how to make key decisions . train your young tibetans . when i make contact with you , i want to reach you through a tibetan .
i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments . industrial progress . great efficiency . your people are capable and courteous .
yes , i am aware . how has your time in china been ?
i leave tomorrow .
ah , dalai lama , thank you for coming so late .
have a sweet . made in my home province . the kind my mother used to make .
for me , i think such a mix is crucial .
you know , i have great respect for your lord buddha . he was anti-caste . anti-corruption . anti-exploitation . for some , politics and religion can mix .
good . very good . tibet is a great country . a wonderful history . long ago , you even conquered part of china . but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you . in twenty years time you could be ahead of us . then it will be your turn to help china .
i am happy to hear you say this , chairman mao . i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax , and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay .
it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement . we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet . the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people . changes must be made slowly , as you , yourself , judge necessary .
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation .
you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature .
you decide .
do you think i must ?
i have one more piece of news . a baby is coming .
you will always !
me ?
but you will always be here ?
i turn you over again , today , lhamo . one day , you will not be able to come running to us .
he was always nice to me . he found me . he saw me in his dreams .
well , some say . it 's not for you to worry about . another will be chosen .
is he a bad man ? norbu says he is `` lavish '' and `` willful '' . `` how can he give you monk 's vows if he has not kept them himself ? ''
i have news . the regent has resigned his post .
soft . nice . i have a good friend back in lhasa .
what does the butter spot feel like ?
you decide .
true .
what do you think ?
is that a true story , or pretend ?
he does , a little spot where the butter had been .
does he have the spot ?
this little brother was terribly sweet . when he died , my mother was so sad . a lama said to her , before the little brother was laid out for burial , take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin . he will come back to you , you will see . so , my mother did this , and a few years later , a new boy was born .
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder .
you have grown up very good .
we have .
we have had fun , you and i. fun for a little boy in an old palace .
i will miss you .
you must study very hard , do not neglect the holy things during this time .
the people will cry when they learn you are gone . but they would all want you safe .
am i running away ?
no , holiness .
you will not come ?
oh , but you do , kundun . who else would be here ?
but , i have no experience .
these are dangerous times . they want the dalai lama to lead them .
then , i am lucky . i am still too young .
the people want you made dalai lama .
reting rinpoche has been arrested . he tried to overthrow regent taktra . today , he is brought back to lhasa by government officials . the monks at sera monastery have been on his side . now , there is trouble between them and the army .
why is this ? what is happening ? tell me !
ahh .
this is tibet . and this is china .
where is poland ?
ahh .
this is britain .
but , surely , we are safe in tibet . we do n't believe in killing .
yes .
the chinese .
we have enemies .
i would not know . maybe .
maybe in the next life , the world will not need a dalai lama .
but you are not a shepherd , you are the dalai lama .
i want to be a shepherd , taking those goats and cows out to the hillside .
you can not .
i want to run down the street . i want to buy a toy . eat from the shops .
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony .
i want to go down there .
as you say .
pretend .
it is a story , you decide .
is that true or pretend ?
she carried a basket in her arms , a big , heavy basket , and the old monk cautiously approached . she opened her basket and showed what she had . heads . human heads . only the heads .
why is your beard so funny ? let me touch this .
things change , kundun .
i have smarter men .
i have more men .
i am braver .
and after the game , we 're going to trade . you just stay over there , no , there ! , norbu , and i will shoot at you . i want your land . i take it . i am stronger .
i 'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men .
it may not be your decision to make .
how could i ever leave ?
you are in great danger . the dalai lama can not fall into chinese hands . you must flee .
these are not human beings . they are worse than ghosts .
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy . we have compassion for all people .
this is not a fight to put bread just in one 's own mouth . this is a fight for tibet .
we can not .
the chinese have one goal . the complete dissolution of our nation . the destruction of our culture . there is no room for buddha in their world . our only hope is to fight .
i remember , too , actually . i was frightened then . i am frightened now .
i do .
do you remember the day i came to your monastery , when i was a baby ? and you comforted me ?
do n't eat all those sweets . you 'll get sick .
eliminate you .
you , kill me ?
they think they have convinced me . they think i am on their side . they have allowed me to leave kumbum and come to lhasa believing that i will try to turn you to their ways . if i do not succeed , i am to eliminate you .
tell me .
doubt is an affliction . reliquish it . accept .
i mean , my doubt . why me ? am i him ?
it is a difficult situation .
what should i do about my doubt , teacher ?
what would you do , holiness ?
if we agree that we are part of china , nothing else will matter . not trade , not defense . we will be lost .
good . where is reting rinpoche now ?
completely .
you are unharmed ?
it is possible , holiness .
taktra rinpoche , i understand there was an attempt on your life .
i see that .
like my mother .
look for a strong woman , not too occupied with her beauty . look for a woman who keeps her hands busy . look for a kind heart .
much too young .
too young ?
no .
does he treat you fairly ?
the land has stayed in the family . we work together . the nobleman is not too bad .
hmm .
i did not know him before i married him . i loved his brother , but then , i married his brother , too . he is dead now .
did you love your husband , before you married ?
you 're all fuckers . vicious little fuckers .
we wo n't let him get hurt , ma'am .
you ca n't take a cow by eminent domain .
no . do you ?
he just < u > appeared < /u > . you have no idea how he arrived in this lake ?
oh , yes .
you killed him .
oh yes . i killed him .
mrs. bickerman , the reason we 're up here ... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake . do you know how your husband died ?
go ahead .
i 'll sue you .
thank you , officer fuckmeat .
you 're to wait right here until the police show , you 're under full house arrest .
murders and rapes in the cities . people bomb planes ... can the police stop them ? < u > no < /u > . but feed one little cow to a crocodile ...
nobody < u > lives < /u > on this lake . it 's really < u > his < /u > lake now .
ma'am , how could you not report this ? he puts human life at risk and --
< u > no < /u > , < u > i < /u > < u > did < /u > < u > not < /u > . the crocodile < u > did < /u > kill him , though . but it was all ... it was a mistake .
ma'am . your husband , bernie . you did n't , by any chance , lead him to the lake blindfolded ?
the < u > reason < /u > i lied is if i 'd told you the truth , you 'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you 're doing .
oh , but you < u > have < /u > , ma'am . you lied to us , that could be obstruction of justice . a man 's been killed in part 'cause of your silence , i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and i 'm sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows .
i have n't broken any laws .
well , he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well ... i think he had alzheimer 's , he would be coherent one day , incoherent the next and one < u > coherent < /u > day , he asked me to end his suffering . i would n't < u > do < /u > it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that i finish him off . finally i just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead .
and how would you have accomplished this , ma'am ?
oh well , i 'm sorry . i did n't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead .
my department does n't have any record of that , mrs. bickerman .
oh , my husband passed away almost two years ago .
< u > i 'm < /u > < u > trying < /u > ! ! !
go ! ! !
jesus . about twelve more yards . keep coming just like that .
< u > no < /u > . if you do n't kill him instantly , i 'm dead and you 'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain , which is about the size of a cherry . and even if you < u > were < /u > on target , a bullet might not penetrate his hide .
i might get a shot .
he 's not gon na hurt < u > me < /u > .
< u > please < /u > . i 'll have sex with you , anything , but get out of the water .
i need to see his habitat .
c'mon hector . i know you 're crazy but you ca n't --
< u > so < /u > < u > why < /u > < u > are < /u > < u > we < /u > < u > landing < /u > ? < u > hector < /u > .
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in .
why are we landing ?
it happens when i land .
it seems like we 're getting lower .
and law enforcement , such dangerous work . the idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring , disconcerting , let 's mate , commit your genes to perpetuity .
thank you .
you 're a beautiful woman .
i do n't know !
where is he ? !
i see blood . maybe you got him , hank .
i just have this feeling everything 's totally safe .
no !
forget about him being god , he 's thirty feet long , he < u > is < /u > a miracle of nature , who somehow made his way to maine . this is a grand beast . < u > a < /u > < u > grand < /u > < u > dragon < /u > . an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive .
gee , that would really disappoint me .
so profound and fat .
you probably < u > do < /u > want to be killed by it , that was you trying to meet your maker .
then do it ! !
i can arrest you ! !
raincheck .
that < u > sounds < /u > good but underneath it 's hurtful . nightcap ?
i 'm tired , hector . i know this because you 're beginning to not bug me .
sobek . half man , half croc , oldest god --
he did n't eat the kid cause he 'd just swallowed a bear .
just spit him back out . some shall live , some shall die , arbitrarily , sound like any higher power we know ?
it came from across the lake .
what 's that ?
< u > bite < /u > < u > my < /u > < u > bishop < /u > .
is everything a big fucking joke to you ?
maybe he does n't play well with others .
obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet .
asia ? how ... how could he get here ?
i have no interest in ever looking at you , hector . could you please cut me down ?
promise you wo n't kill me , first .
you do n't want to cut me down . 'cause i 'll kill you .
this is a setback .
i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless .
his head was just ... bitten off .
whenever somebody dies i consider it such a waste that i did n't know him better .
yup .
was he a good man ?
no thank you , but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log .
i brought a pork chop , maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck .
what i 'm saying is < u > if < /u > it 's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old , it would be unthinkable to destroy him .
is this a trick ?
crocodiles do n't sever with their teeth , their molars are blunt .
again . not to be disruptive . do we have a problem with it dying ?
no crocodile has ever --
that `` walt '' guy got hit underwater --
they do n't really attack underwater and --
again , i do n't mean to be annoying with my questions . but if it < u > is < /u > a crocodile which i do n't think it is . and if they < u > do < /u > charge these baby hatchling sounds ... why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time ? with you it makes sense .
this could end up saving your life , --
i coulda shot you , you --
i keep telling you , they < u > can < /u > come on land , i do n't wan na wake up in the middle of the night --
a spring trap !
i 'm laying a spring trap !
you 're crawling around like a --
what are < u > you < /u > doing ? !
what the hell are you doing ? ! !
jesus christ ! !
deep down , gut check . i 'm growing fond of < u > you < /u > and it 's liberating to say so .
i do < u > not < /u > like you .
and you like me .
you listen to me . the only reason i 'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar --
no ! ! out !
could < u > she < /u > stay , we 've tentatively scheduled intercourse .
everybody out , back to your tents , < u > now < /u > !
they come on land and they 're brazen . they 're also attracted to noise , you can see i make a lot of it .
< u > no < /u > ! ! what 's with digging the holes ?
cocktail ?
we are here on official business .
species , keystones affect the entire ecosystem , that could explain all these worms , the water . you 've got a crocodile . bury your friend .
keystone what ?
well , you 've got a croc alright , they 're keystone species .
we 'd only just met .
if he 's eaten in the area , he should n't be far away . crocs hang around the food source .
around here . yeah .
they can survive winter . as long as their nostrils do n't freeze , they survive , am i foolish to explain things , he had such trouble with my name ?
and what would he do come winter ?
they have saltwater glands , they can swim across oceans , it 's only a matter of time .
i really do n't mean to be discourteous . but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england ?
c'mon , we 're losing light , why does the big one heckle me ?
mr. cyr !
they 've been migrating north , kelly , this lake connects to the ocean , --
i apologize , i just do n't want to lose the light , we 've got time for a quick scout , you 've had work done .
wait just a second . you do n't just fly in here and start barking orders .
i 'll need any and all topographic studies .
-- < u > who < /u > < u > is < /u > < u > he < /u > ?
just those two .
women 's intuition . are there anymore ?
she did n't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we 'd blow it 's head off .
you talk to bickerman ?
you take care .
yeah and every time we think there 's no more danger --
< u > no < /u > . look . he 's got nothing left .
tranq guns down , rifles up !
where is he ?
you shoot on my order . if he charges , i 'll be yelling `` go '' which means drivers take off . and drive fast , they can move on land . you set ?
thank you , jack .
almost here , hector . do n't forget to lift up the cow .
okay . lead him in . okay , everybody up on the trucks . we aim for the stomach or side ... there 's little chance the darts will pierce his hide . < u > everybody < /u > < u > up < /u > < u > on < /u > < u > the < /u > < u > trucks < /u > .
radar , he 's underwater . but he 's definitely coming .
can you confirm visually or just radar ?
thirty meters or so . moving slow , but straight toward elsie .
where ? where ?
you do ?
i got something on the screen .
we 're ready .
you ready on shore ?
the more he thrashes , the better .
right .
keep enough tension to hold him up , hector , we do n't know if he can swim .
that 's actually the easy part .
and again . how would you get him on land ?
we both know what they 'll do .
so maybe wildlife will try to save him , they 're more equipped to --
jack . we 've all seen it . he 's probably a hundred and fifty years old , he 's bigger than an elephant .
no way .
look . i know i 'm crazy , but when they come , they will kill it . they have to , politically , he 's too dangerous , if something were to go wrong ... the odds are he will be destroyed , --
< u > forget < /u > < u > it < /u > .
i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out . and i think i know a way to --
well , you can try talking them into that , if --
'cause he just ate a cow , you stupid --
let 's not overlook he did n't eat me , maybe --
hey ! !
bastard bit my chopper .
this time , < u > i 'm < /u > gon na kick your ass .
get the gun .
he never said `` go '' .
get your big gun and guard the shore . hector . go to your tent .
at school they 'd always say `` go '' first .
and hank . i know you were n't really trying to hit him .
yeah . thanks to you .
he 's gon na live ?
yeah , you got bit . i 'm gon na fix it .
guess i finally got bit .
you 're gon na be okay .
you 're not okay , your leg 's a mess .
i 'm okay .
we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs .
and how would we neutralize him ?
they wo n't . he 's taken human life , the mission will be to put him down .
they could try to tranq him on land .
they 're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans . tranq him in water , he drowns .
could we have intercourse ?
what ?
yes . you may . but maybe ... i do n't know ...
can i tell them you wo n't go back in the water ?
eh . fuck it .
no .
did n't even < u > sound < /u > good ?
oh , bullshit .
i 'm an empty man , kelly , wealth has robbed me of the dream in life , i sit here broken , a hollow sack --
i 'm no psychiatrist . but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy , than --
with crocodiles ... everything 's even .
< u > nothing 's < /u > real . i 'm rich , people are automatically my friends , sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and --
excuse me ?
nothing 's real .
hector . what you just did ... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on .
you think i 'm < u > that < /u > nuts ?
< u > did < /u > you want to be killed by it ?
i 'm a civilian ! you do n't have any authority --
< u > jack < /u > !
scales were oval . it was an < u > asian < /u > crocodile .
are you sure ?
he was an indo-pacific .
as if . will you miss me ?
what ? oh as < u > if < /u > i 'm interested .
two years married , divorced , used to be a lawyer , quit , i 'm still waiting on his sperm count .
i 'm just saying last resort .
and what if i tranq him kelly ? he drowns . you think about that ?
you < u > should < /u > take a flax pole .
u.s. wildlife wo n't send anybody without a confirmation .
such the flirt .
what 's going on ?
none of us actually < u > saw < /u > anything . i realize this sir , but something flipped us over , i doubt very much it was a mink .
< u > hector < /u > .
'cept he was n't before , was he ? you know , when friends or family members say things , they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger . you 're fat .
but they 're nighttime hunters , hector , he 'd probably be on land now anyway .
even so , you 're allowed to boast . you look thin by the way , i 've mentally undressed you , i can see your ribcage .
i never had sex with you !
if he 's here , i 'll find him . did she tell you we had sex together ?
that hurt my feelings .
hector . the big one has no sense of humor . and since < u > he 's < /u > the one who decides whether you get to play , try not to be your obnoxious self .
good thinking .
that was ... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss , now i 'll be able to tell him if you can .
probably not .
worth a try . we do n't wan na be alone forever , do we ?
you think ?
so i was thinking ... maybe if i met anybody in < u > my < /u > world who was good for < u > you < /u > and if you know somebody in new york good for me , we could fix each other up .
no .
yeah , i thought about that as i was driving ... and ... i have n't found somebody in my world . you found anyone in yours ?
different worlds , jack .
likewise .
it was ... something meeting you .
but we do . hey , we 'll always have maine .
y'know , if we did n't live in separate worlds and ...
yeah .
if i 'm ever in new york ...
no , i actually < u > want < /u > to stay for a little while .
you sure ? i do n't mind ...
you wan na ride in my truck ?
well ...
he heeds a tourniquet .
get him onto shore .
i do n't care . hank . end it .
he 's through fighting . look at him .
back us in a little , we need to get a shot !
we got ta get to hector ! !
take him .
hector ! !
keep firing !
watch out ! !
you would n't ?
he 's mooing .
hector .
he 's floating . take it home .
he does n't seem to be swimming . is he swimming ?
he looks like a giant tea bag .
he < u > has < /u > been going after everything . it < u > could < /u > work . but this is not a happy cow .
it ca n't work .
we 've got a cow hanging from a helicopter .
well ...
are we crazy ?
good idea .
we might as well pack .
okay .
just heard from wildlife and florida fish and game . they should be here by four .
< u > no < /u > ! you might think they 're godly , you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin ' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and --
alright , jack !
you wan na kill yourself , that it , you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide ?
look .
what ?
< u > calm < /u > < u > down < /u > .
you calm down !
calm down .
< u > no < /u > . i keep getting hit with heads !
really --
< u > that < /u > < u > is < /u > < u > it < /u > ! !
okay . okay . okay .
< u > i 'm < /u > < u > not < /u > < u > mushing < /u > < u > it < /u > .
you 're mushing it a little around the --
i 'm not mushing it .
maybe . do n't mush it .
thing we can lift it ?
i heard something .
what ?
ssssh !
i 'm gon na get ticks . i know it . they 're drawn to me . i got a thing about ticks .
we could < u > not < /u > say it and ... well , that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to ...
we seem to say goodnight a lot .
well . goodnight .
night .
thanks for the ... bandaid .
maybe . i 've always < u > read < /u > about what 's happened . i 've never ... i know it sounds silly but , it 's nice to be someplace < u > while < /u > something is actually ... y'know ... happening .
that 's why you 're here . to get in the middle of something ?
what ? why ... people have been killed , i hardly think i 'm having a good time , why would ... does it show ?
you 're having the best time of your life , are n't you ?
thank you .
keep it dry . no swimming .
no thanks .
father 's a surgeon . i can even stitch in a pinch , would n't be a bad idea here .
who taught you be be a nurse ?
just got ta pull it a little tighter .
< u > ow < /u > . shit .
it 's okay .
sorry .
let 's get away from the shore .
i wonder if he 's some kind of mutant . that bear had to be surprised .
i could n't believe ... did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ?
yeah . i got some stuff for your cut .
like little children . you okay ?
but why < u > maine < /u > and why alone ? crocs are social , why 's this guy on the move by himself ?
why he 's that < u > big < /u > , i do n't know . why he 's < u > here < /u > ... the wetlands are being developed , crocodiles are moving . australia , fiji , the things have started to cross oceans .
just forget it .
a man just died , you 're hitting on me with science .
i was trying to pay you a compliment , i was guising it as science 'cause i know you 're comfortable in that arena . science .
you < u > did < /u > , you --
i did n't say it like that .
nice ? nice would be `` you look pretty , '' nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good .
forgive me for trying to be nice .
gee , that was so poetic , jack . i 'm all moist .
i 'm saying between the moonlight , a beautiful lake < u > and < /u > a monster that bites heads off ... you look good .
what are you talking about ?
when you get scared , the brain releases a chemical , same chemical it releases when somebody 's ... in high school , the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie .
excuse me ?
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion .
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow , look for prints .
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness .
um ... y'know ... yeah .
< u > are < /u > you okay ?
police want to keep it quiet , if the press gets word ... lake monster . they just want us to sit tight .
that 's probably good .
no . u.s. wildlife is on their way .
yeah . nobody saw < u > anything < /u > ?
you okay ? kelly ?
good luck .
good . see ya soon .
they respond pretty quick . i 'll wait till you get down before i turn it on .
in his defense , every primitive culture known to man deified them . he 's a mythology professor , he thinks crocs are divine conduits .
he thinks they 're what ?
'night .
good .
okay . we 're up at six .
i 'm sorry but you 're ...
that was an awful thing to say to me .
i am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me , is this some kind of --
you flew up here because your boss --
i did n't fly up here to roast marshmallows --
it 's too dangerous for --
i am < u > not < /u > staying on shore .
whatever 's out there < u > did < /u > flip over a canoe --
i beg your pardon ?
listen , uh ... hank and i think it best if you stay on shore .
skipping stones . look how flat that water is , you can get ten skips on a good one .
what are you doing ?
i 'd be able to see something .
he could be right there and you would n't see him .
because they just consult their little indigenous charts .
if one could be out there ... why does fish and game tell me it 's impossible ?
adult males will charge hatchlings . if there 's one out there ...
baby crocs ?
well until we see it , we 're not gon na be convincing too many people .
< u > something 's < /u > in that water .
same thing from fish and game .
there < u > have < /u > been northern sightings . but not < u > this < /u > north .
in maine ?
hector cyr . he 's a rich kook mythology professor . he 's done some work with our museum . he also treks the world to swim with crocodiles .
who ?
if this is who i < u > think < /u > it is . it < u > is < /u > .
what ?
oh my god .
i 've come , i 'm here , i 'm staying . unless there are ticks .
well . you do n't have to < u > stay < /u > out < u > here < /u > , why do n't --
i 'm not making it up .
you do n't like tents , mosquitos , look at your fingernails , you have about as much business being in the woods --
so i do n't like tents , why --
and even if they < u > did < /u > , i doubt < u > he < /u > or < u > she < /u > would have problems with < u > tents < /u > .
how would < u > you < /u > know , what --
the museum of natural history does n't send out investigators to --
i < u > told < /u > you .
why are you here ? really .
i was told they discriminate against people with hygiene . i never < u > believed < /u > it .
never been to maine before ?
it really is beautiful , is n't it ?
hank < u > says < /u > he 's sure .
and they 're sure he did n't get tangled under the outboard somehow ?
big but ... a bear could n't do that to a moose or man in < u > water < /u > . on < u > land < /u > maybe . but ...
how big do the bears get ?
ma'am , your first impression is n't going well .
excuse me . one other thing , it 's a < u > small < /u > point , but ... i have a thing about being humored , and i 'm feeling humored , more by < u > him < /u > , but you seemed quick to join in .
yes , it < u > did < /u > seem prehistoric but i 'm sure he just carried the thing for luck . not that it < u > worked < /u > , obviously . it probably somehow got lodged into his body .
did you make anything of the tooth ?
are we all museum bigots in maine ?
jack wells . a museum sent you ?
kelly scott .
you too .
thanks for your help .
do n't count on it . we better take him out .
he 's done . he 's dying .
hector . < u > do < /u > < u > not < /u > < u > move < /u > .
i 'll take it !
if you get a safe shot ...
where is he ? !
i ca n't . i 'll get hector ! !
other than to eat us ?
even if we < u > could < /u > tranq him -- how would we get him on land .
< u > you < /u > < u > got ta < /u > < u > be < /u > < u > kidding < /u > .
now i 'm gon na puke .
so does he .
they wo n't be here till at least noon . we got a few hours to kill .
we should n't even really be doing this .
get back from the shore . we know how fast he can leap out .
obviously i was wrong !
you said nobody came in here !
alright , ms. paleontologist . i wan na know why that monster is here . you got a theory ?
hank . the little cannon you brought , get it . guard the shoreline . otherwise , we 're done . we made the i.d. , our job is finished .
they look like they 're jumping .
does n't < u > look < /u > like it .
are they feeding ?
white perch .
what 's that ?
i 'll call the coroner .
you gon na dig up that lady 's husband ?
half mile up , there 's a clearing .
let 's go .
i 'm ready when you are .
ready . a museum in new york sent us some additional back up .
we set ?
i guess .
i 'm sure this would offend you on principal but ... could we keep in touch ?
wait .
should i ?
i do n't know . back the truck --
did you get him ?
that it 's about to go wrong .
such a simple idea and it 's working . what does that tell you ?
they 're coming right in .
she 's worried about the cow now .
if he gets close , you go < u > up < /u > , hector , do n't you endanger that cow .
look ten feet into the water .
what ?
what is she doing < u > now < /u > ? < u > mother < /u > < u > of < /u > < u > god < /u > .
look .
shit , shit , shit , shit , shit .
he said he knew karate !
hank !
other than feeling slightly embarrassed , i 'm perfectly fine . could you cut me down ?
are you okay ?
yes .
hank ?
i think . my hair . where 's hector ? ! where is he ?
are you alright ?
i do n't know . it was like a tug . something tugged us .
what was that ?
< u > that < /u > was a bust .
hector , jack , we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left , and you 're on the last tank . time to go home .
well . he 's probably rugged handsome i guess . yeah .
i 'm just curious . i can never tell what women think is handsome . is he handsome ?
what is this ?
you think jack 's handsome ?
well hector 's a giant cracker .
hector thinks you like him .
< u > what < /u > ? i do n't even < u > know < /u > the guy .
you like jack ?
he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes .
and that 's why he thinks they 're godly ?
he may be a kook but he 's also been all over the world with them . he even swam in the grimetti with killer niles all around him , he never got nipped .
i asked you to be nice to him .
was that like a homo-sexual remark ?
i 'm sorry .
why does everybody insult my intelligence , i have intelligence , intelligent people eat twinkies .
it 's to make you < u > understand < /u > him , with understanding comes tolerance . too bad they do n't put proverbs in twinkies , my load would be lighter .
is this 'spose to make me take him more serious ?
< u > apologize < /u > ?
you hurt his feelings . i think you should go apologize .
thank you , it 's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you , you fucker .
they do n't believe her .
crocodiles . he 's an expert on them . and if he 's < u > here < /u > ... then he must think that 's what 's in this lake .
with what ?
i just let go of it .
you threw it at me ! !
hey ! !
it looks like a branch .
i thought i saw ...
what ?
what the hell ?
yes , < u > camp < /u > , i thought that meant holiday inn , i never heard `` tents '' , will there be toilets ?
i told you . two days , we 'd have to camp .
we 're staying in < u > tents < /u > ?
the tents were sent ahead , they should already be set-up .
gee .
they wanted to call it lake placid . but somebody said that name was taken .
what is with this lake ? it looks black and ... there are no waves or anything .
sheriff .
was he swallowed ?
we do n't mean to invade your privacy but ... was he ill , was he sick ?
it 's just that --
you 're sort of a rude person .
and you stock these things for what , to fend off russia ?
lightweight forward area air device unit . whatever 's out there , one shot with this and he 's dead .
< u > what < /u > < u > is < /u > < u > that < /u > ?
ever even been < u > in < /u > one ?
i got nothing against --
you have a thing against museums ?
sorry . i 'm just a little unclear as to why the museum of natural history would send somebody here .
what ?
< u > we < /u > ?
what kind of backup do we have ?
not yet .
you talk to the married couple ?
nobody lives within twenty-five miles , 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake . teenagers trek in every once in a while , none have disappeared , and none have spotted anything unusual .
okay . and is there a place nearby i could go to vomit ?
yes .
and this is how he came to the boat ?
seconds . three , four .
this ... how long did this attack go on for ?
i can look at dead things .
this is a little different .
well . at wakes .
have you ever seen a dead body before , ms. scott ?
i 'm fine , thank you .
i would n't .
um . no , no . let 's go .
that 's where they keep them . you want me to bring the tooth out here ?
is the dead guy in there ?
yes .
< u > there < /u > ? that 's the morgue .
the lake was dead calm until up he came . the tooth is in there .
and you did n't see < u > anything < /u > ?
he just kinda gurgled . he was pretty much dead .
did he say anything ?
he just came up screaming .
< u > i < /u > < u > am < /u > < u > not < /u > < u > going < /u > < u > to < /u > < u > maine < /u > . that 's ridiculous .
< u > kelly < /u > --
i never do field work and even if i did , < u > maine < /u > , to look at a tooth of a < u > dinosaur < /u > who bit somebody , could n't you dream up something --
it has nothing to do with --
this was myra 's idea , was n't it ? get me out of the office for a few days , until --
well on this one i 'd like you to be .
i 'm not even a field person .
part of our research --
i 'm not going to maine , i wo n't even go west of forty-third street --
kelly --
are you on drugs ?
i 'd like you to check out this lake . see --
this is what we do ?
i 'm sure it 's nothing , but you 're a paleontologist , this is what we do , i --
sorry ?
i want you to go there .
oh , well then i 'm sure that 's it , he got killed by a dinosaur , anything else ?
a tooth they say could n't have come from any bear . they say it looks prehistoric . like maybe a dinosaur .
a tooth ?
this is business . there was an accident in maine , some guy got killed by something in a lake . probably a bear , but ... they found a tooth .
kevin . how 's it going , what 's happenin ' , family good , great , nice to catch up , get out .
hey .
yes , well ... famished .
it 's ten after nine .
< u > oh < /u > ... no , no , i 'm not angry i 'm not , i 'm just thrown , i 'm ... i actually have an early lunch , so ...
a jerk .
oh . oh . that 's okay . well . this uh ... this probably was n't meant to be , y'know . i mean , i 'm ... god , i got ta be ten years younger and you , < u > you < /u > ... you 're y'know ...
else .
yeah , that part . there 's ... somebody who 's um ...
the somebody else part ?
kevin , as long as we ... what was that last part ?
i know and i thought i could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else , it 's a dangerous mix .
i was working for you when `` us '' started , what 's --
you work for me . i 'm not comfortable with -- y'know , `` us '' ...
that 's not what you came to say .
me too .
i had a great time last night . again .
absolutely .
hi . listen . could i steal you a second ?
kevin , hey .
kelly .
i really ... i should get back .
shitbutt ?
myra .
liar ?
no .
backstabber ?
i 'm not upset , myra , okay . i just never thought of you as a y'know ...
kelly --
you do n't know what to say , lucky for you action speaks louder than words .
it was n't suppose to happen , i do n't know what to say ...
you and kevin .
it was just a quick thing which we thought was over , and and ...
< u > you < /u > ?
it started < u > before < /u > you , kelly , i never would 've --
< u > you < /u > ?
well ... he did n't have to tell me that part .
really ? i never realized he was so psychic , how could he detect that , did he tell you there 's somebody else ?
kevin told me you were upset .
i do n't like to be scared , myra , i have a thing about fright , do n't ever scare me .
wild guess .
well you < u > should n't < /u > have . how did you even know where i was .
i < u > tapped < /u > you .
what do you expect , mugging me from behind ?
agent mapp ! thank you !
agent starling ! telephone !
he knew her ... !
hot damn , clarice .
`` - every day . ''
but why ? he did n't weight the others .
'cause she did n't drift . he weighted her down .
fredrica bimmel , from belvedere , ohio . the first girl taken , but the third body found ... why ?
the one that was weighted down . where is she ... ? fred something .
what girl ?
well , except for the one girl .
but there is no pattern . there 's no connection at all among these places , or the computers would 've nailed it ! they 're even found in random order .
not random at all , maybe . like there 's some pattern here ... ?
`` desperately random . '' what does he mean ?
he 's here , ardelia .
lecter said a lot of things .
the worst part - the thing that 's making me crazy - is that bill is right in front of me . only i ca n't see him ... lecter said , everything i need to catch him is right here , in these pages ...
clarice - you did the best anybody could have for catherine martin . you stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried . it 's not your fault it ended this way .
it would be rude . and he would n't get to ask any more questions ...
why not ?
no . he wo n't come after me .
somebody 's coaching her ... they 're trying to make him see catherine as a person - not just an object .
why does she keep repeating the name ?
boy , is that smart ...
pleading with a crazy man , with come all over my face .
you missed fourth amendment law . unlawful seizure , real juicy stuff . where were you all afternoon ?
thanks , ardelia .
phone call , clarice . it 's god .
stay cool . just remember to call him `` god . ''
what 'd i do ?
i love it when you talk dirty .
never cock . just squeeze .
damn , clarice , how 'd you make me ?
listen , i hope you never need a thing i 've taught you . but you 've got something ... jack sees it , i do too . if you ever need to , you can shoot .
i will ... i promise .
wear it , do n't ever leave it in your purse . dry fire it whenever you get the chance . and do your exercises .
he 's got a lot on his mind besides buffalo bill ... his wife , bella , is real sick . comatose ... i 'm tellin ' you about it now , 'cause he may never .
sometimes .
jack 's pretty tough on you , is n't he ? impatient ...
i 'll need the big fingerprint kit ... and the one-to-one polaroid , the cu- 5 , with film packs and batteries .
some fishermen in west virginia found an unidentified girl 's body . it 's a buffalo bill-type situation . been in the water about a week , and jack needs somebody that can print a floater . think you can handle it ?
where ?
get your field gear , take stuff for overnight . you 're goin ' with crawford .
shut up ! the other officers will be here any minute ! you 're perfectly safe now !
nooooo ! you fucking bitch do n't you leave me down here , do n't you - you
catherine . listen to me . i have to find a rope . i have to leave this room , just for a minute , but -
i do n't know ! get me out ! !
i 'll get you out ! just be quiet so i can hear . shut that dog up . is there a ladder ? is there a rope ?
get me out !
you 're all right ! where is he ?
safe , shit , he 's got a gun ! getmeout . get me out !
fbi , catherine , you 're safe .
he 's my patient ! i have rights ! i 'm not just some turnkey , miss starling . i should n't even be here this afternoon . i had a ticket to holiday on ice .
dr. chilton , i told you - this is just routine follow-up on the raspail case .
what you 're doing , miss starling , is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview , and refusing to share information with me . for the third time !
but then i would 've missed the pleasure of your company .
you might have suggested that in my office , and saved me the time .
dr. chilton - if lecter feels you 're his enemy - as you 've said - then maybe i 'll have more luck by myself . what do you think ?
i 'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions ... on the afternoon of july 8 , 1981 , he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary . his mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an ekg . when the nurse bent over him , he did this to her ...
i understand .
do not reach through the bars , do not touch the bars . you pass him nothing but soft paper - no pens or pencils . no staples or paperclips in his paper . use the sliding food carrier , no exceptions . do not accept anything he attempts to hold out to you . do you understand me ?
good . then you should be able to remember the rules .
i graduated magna from uva , doctor . it 's not a charm school .
a pretty young woman , to turn him on ? i do n't believe lecter 's ever seen a woman in eight years . and oh , are you ever his `` taste '' - so to speak .
how do you mean , dr. chilton ?
lecter carved up nine people - that we 're sure of - and cooked his favorite bits . we 've tried to study him , of course - but he 's much too sophisticated for the standard tests . and my , does he hate us ! thinks i 'm his nemesis ... crawford 's very clever , is n't he ? using you .
i see . let 's make this quick , then . i 'm busy .
i 'm sure it 's a great town , dr. chilton , but my instructions are to talk to lecter and report back this afternoon .
the market in lecter hints is way down , today , okay ? i 've got two good men dead in memphis , and three civilians . i 've got -
but then he had to cover up , make her seem just like all the rest of them . that 's what lecter was hinting !
starling -
maybe he lives in this , this belvedere , ohio , too ! maybe he saw her every day , and killed her sort of spontaneously . maybe he just meant to ... give her a 7-up and talk about the choir . but then -
yes sir . i can find it by myself .
do you need a police escort , starling ? or do you think you can find the airport by yourself ?
sir , does n't this `` william rubin '' strike you as - i do n't know - kind of vague ?
he gave us a perfectly good description , and we 're on it now , so we wo n't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his , either . he 's under close guard at the courthouse , pending a prison transfer . the next plane , officer .
lecter has already named buffalo bill .
mr. krendler ... dr. lecter trusts me . or at least , he used to . if i could just -
gun . jesus . turn in the id as soon as you get back . the gun , too . be on the next plane , starling , there 's one in 90 minutes .
i need the id to fly with my gun . the gun belongs in quantico .
your instructions are what i 'm giving you now . jack crawford answers to the director , and the director answers to me . my god , crawford 's losing it ... ! he should n't even be on this , with his wife sick as she is ... how the hell did you get in here , anyway ? he gave you - what ? some kind of special id ? let 's have it .
sir , mr. crawford instructed me -
you 're out of line , starling , and you 're off this case . back to quantico .
not yet ! - just wait for me . maybe in about two seconds .
oh my ! oh my ... maybe you better come out now , miss starling .
mr. yow ? oh mr. yow ... ? it looks like somebody is sitting in this car .
oh .
that was n't me .
you 're playing a piano , miss starling ?
okay , mr. yow ...
okay , miss starling ?
good idea .
might i suggest tucking your pants into your socks ? to prevent mouse intrusion .
mr. yow , if this door should fall down -ha ha ! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number ? it 's our baltimore field office . they know you 're here with me ... do you understand ?
i wo n't disturb anything , mr. yow , i promise . be gone before you know it .
not to my knowledge . privacy is a great concern to my customers . but , if you say this is an fbi matter ...
did she leave any records here ? tax or business records ? maybe a list of employees ?
yes . i bought the house from her , two years ago .
mr. gordon , did you take over this place after mrs. lippman died ?
i think we may be , yes .
are they close to catching somebody , do you think ?
thanks .
mrs. lippman had a son , maybe he could help you . i have his card somewhere . do you mind stepping inside , while i looks for it ?
no . wait ... was she a great , fat person ? i may have seen her , i 'm not sure ...
mr. gordon , did you know fredrica when she worked for mrs. lippman ?
jack gordon .
i 'm investigating the death of fredrica bimmel . who are you , please ?
just briefly . what 's the problem , officer ?
excuse me , but i really do need to talk to you . this was mrs. lippman 's house . did you know her ?
yes sir . thank you , sir ...
starling - you 've earned back your place in the academy . we never would 've found him without you , and nobody 's ever going to forget that . least of all me .
yes sir ... i 'll do my best .
no , starling , there is n't time . and you 've still got crucial work to do in ohio . we want him for murder , not kidnapping . i 'm counting on you to link him to the bimmel girl , before he 's indicted .
chicago 's only about 400 miles from here . i could be there in -
take a bow . customs had some paper on his alias . they stopped a carton two years ago at lax - live caterpillars from surinam . the addressee was `` john grant . '' calumet power & light 's given us two possible residences under that alias . we 're hitting one , chicago swat 's taking the other .
sewing ...
this gumb 's a real beauty . slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve , and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric . where , starling , he took vocational rehab , and learned a useful trade ...
johns hopkins finally came up with a name for us . we fed him into known offenders , and he came up cherries . subject 's name is `` jamie gumb , '' aka `` john grant . '' lecter 's description was accurate , he just lied about the name .
sir , that 's great news . but how -
where ?
starling , we know who he is ! and where he is . we 're on our way now .
that 's why they 're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin ! he keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin , so that -
starling -
he 's making himself a `` woman suit , '' mr. crawford - out of real women ! and he can sew , this guy , he 's really skilled . a dressmaker , or a tailor -
he 's going to kill her , mr. crawford . this morning , or maybe at noon , but today , and belvedere 's our last chance . i 'm flying there , right now , unless you stop me . you want my id ? here - take it ...
with id and a gun ... ? impersonating a federal agent is a felony .
but i just became a private citizen . i can go anywhere i want to .
i 'm bureau for 28 years , starling . i wo n't disobey orders , not even now .
but not from this angle . not thinking he knew her . you 've got to send me !
ohio is cold ground . picked over , ten months ago . our people worked it , so did the locals .
you do until six p.m .
you heard them . i do n't have that authority anymore .
all his victims are women ... his obsession is women , he lives to hunt women . but not one women is hunting him - except me . i can walk in a woman 's room and know three times as much about her as a man would . i have to go to belvedere .
they 'll use their best men . but they better be paying attention ...
mr. crawford ... can those cops down there handle dr. lecter ?
good idea . meantime , try to get a feel for catherine martin . her apartment , her friends ... how he might 've stalked her . i 'm going to the other two clinics , minnesota and ohio . now 's the hardest part , starling . use your anger , do n't let it keep you from thinking . just keep your eyes on catherine . we 've got less than 30 hours .
i lied to lecter . i 'll need some kind of peace offering ... can i get the drawings from his cell ?
or just as worthless . but i want you in memphis , close to him . maybe when he gets tired of toying with senator martin , he 'll talk to you again . there 's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip .
lecter is still the key , i know he is . whatever he told me about bill is just as good now as it was before .
if you did n't want me chasing him , you should n't have taken me to that funeral home .
i 'm 53 , starling . if i found jimmy hoffa on national tv , i 'd still have to retire in two years . it 's not a consideration . but you are ... you 've done enough . if i keep you out of school any longer , you 'll be recycled . cost you six months , at least . i can guarantee you readmission here , but that 's about it . now 's your chance , starling . go back to class . leave bill to me .
are you in trouble over this , mr. crawford ? can senator martin do something to you ?
let 's get some coffee and talk .
chilton has killed her , has n't he ? that slimy little bastard ! we were so close with lecter - and now her last chance is gone .
she does n't know what we 're up to . and we ca n't afford to let her find out .
you 'll back me up with some paperwork ? then i 'll try . but would n't this have more weight coming from the senator herself ?
state to federal jurisdiction ... we can do it - eventually - but we 'll never get all the clearances in time . can you convince him a deal 's already in place ?
transfer to a new prison . with a view of trees , he said , or even water ... can we swing that ?
what would it take ?
i think he means it , this time . i think he 'll deal .
if we act too anxious , he 'll make us wait . he 'll let the senator keep hoping , day after day , until catherine finally washes up . that 'd be the most fun of all .
but if he knew we have so little time -
he offered to help , starling , not to snitch . that would n't give him enough chance to show off . remember , lecter looks mainly for fun . never forget fun .
he 's already offered to help ... what would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for bill ?
but for catherine martin , it all comes down to you and lecter . you 're the one he talks to .
raspail was killed by the same man who 's killing these girls . and lecter knows him . maybe even treated him ... you think so , too , do n't you ? or you 'd never have sent me to that asylum .
you seem pretty sure of that .
then have the lab check raspail 's head . dr. lecter 's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues ... they 'll find another cocoon .
the other girls are in the ground . exhumations are upsetting for the families . i 'll do it if i have to , but -
i 'm wondering if he 's done that before - placed a cocoon , or an insect . it would be easy to miss in an autopsy , especially with a floater ... can we check back on that ?
when we get back , i want you to run that bug by the smithsonian , see if they can identify it . maybe it 's got some limited range , or it only breeds at certain times of year ... you found it , starling , you deserve the credit .
point taken .
it matters , mr. crawford ... other cops know who you are . they look at you to see how to act ... it matters .
when i told that sheriff we should n't talk in front of a woman , that really burned you , did n't it ? that was just smoke , starling , i had to get rid of him . you did well in there .
they were n't there . get close-ups .
i do n't know . i did n't see those on any of the other girls ...
well , she 's not local . her ears are pierced three times each , and she 's wearing green glitter nail polish . looks like town to me ...
what do you see , starling ?
he starts this - buzzing in me , in my head . he makes me feel violated ... you used me , mr. crawford .
are you finished ?
you knew . you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this ... but you were n't up front with me . you sent me in to him naked .
what should i say ? you did fine work . we 'll wait on the lab .
you have n't said a word today about that garage . or what i found there .
okay , starling . let 's have it .
like i have a `` knack '' for dr. lecter ?
maybe you 've got a knack for this ... i guess we 're about to find out .
he 's got a real taste for it now . and he 's getting better at his work .
why not ?
what he does with them - takes privacy ... time , tools ... he 's in his 30 's or 40 's - he 's got real physical strength , but combined with an older man 's self-control . he 's cautious , precise , never impulsive ... this wo n't end in suicide , like they often do .
why ?
he 's a white male ... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group . and he 's not a drifter - he 's got his own house , somewhere . not an apartment .
talk about him , starling . tell me what you see .
good idea , but he thought of it , too . we 've run simulations , using different vectors and the best dates we can assign . you put it all in the computer , and smoke comes out . no , this one is different . this one has seen us coming ...
there 's no correlation at all between where they 're kidnapped and where they 're found ... ? what if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites ? do they converge at all ?
blue square for belvedere , ohio , where the bimmel girl was abducted . blue triangle where her body was found - down here in missouri . same marks for the other four girls , in different colors . this new one , today ... washed up here . elk river , in west virginia , about six miles below u.s. 79. real boonies .
you do n't have to feel any way about it . lecter did it to amuse himself . why not , what can they do ? take away his books for awhile , and no jello ... i know it got ugly today . but this is your report , starling - take it as far as you can . on your own time , outside of class . now carry on .
i 'm here , sir , i just - i do n't know how to feel about it .
the orderly heard lecter whispering to him , all afternoon , and miggs crying . they found him at bed check . he 'd swallowed his own tongue ... chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit , and he 's trying to blame it on you . i told the little prick your conduct was flawless . starling ... ?
murdered ... ? how ?
miggs has been murdered .
sir , what is it ? there 's something you 're not telling me .
then do that , starling . do just exactly that .
to complete and file my report by 0800 wednesday . but sir -
do you recall my instructions to you , starling ? what were they ?
sir , that 's a field job . it 's outside the scope of my assignment . and i 've got a test tomorrow on -
well ? why are n't you there right now ?
i spent all evening on the mainframe . lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories , prior to capture . no record of anyone named mofet . but `` split city '' sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce . i tracked it down in the library 's catalogue of national yellow pages . it 's a mini-storage facility outside baltimore , where lecter had his practice .
he mentioned a name , at the very end . `` mofet ... '' any followup on her ?
right down to the kleenex i used . sir , why ? is something wrong ?
every word , starling ? every gesture ?
it 's all there , sir , practically verbatim .
i 've read your interim memo on lecter . you sure you 've left nothing out ?
and what is that , sir ?
be very careful with hannibal lecter . dr. chilton at the asylum will go over the physical procedures used with him . do not deviate from them , for any reason . you tell him nothing personal , starling . believe me , you do n't want hannibal lecter inside your head ... just do your job , but never forget what he is .
yes sir .
now . i want your full attention , starling . are you listening to me ?
you 're qualified and available . and frankly , i ca n't spare a real agent right now .
yes , well ... okay , right . i 'm glad for the chance , sir , but - why me ?
the psychiatrist - dr. hannibal lecter .
who 's the subject ?
you see , the one we want most refuses to cooperate . i want you to go after him again today , in the asylum .
not yet .
we 're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody , for a psychobehavioral profile . could be a big help in unsolved cases . most of them have been happy to talk to us . they have a compulsion to boast , these people ... do you spook easily , starling ?
a job 's come up and i thought about you . not really a job , more of - an interesting errand . walk me to my car , starling .
i hope so . they have n't posted anything .
your instructors tell me you 're doing well . top quarter of the class .
good morning , mr. crawford .
starling , clarice m. , good morning .
dr. lecter ...
they live in malaysia . in this country , they 'd have to be specially raised , from imported eggs .
and there 's no way - no natural way - these could 've wound up in the bodies ?
not lately . but maybe someday .
ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer ? the amusing house wine ... ?
i try to be a student , dr. pilcher .
what do you do when you 're not detecting , officer starling ?
freddie was so happy for me when i got this job . this - toaster giveaways , and barry manilow on the speakers all day - she thought this was really hot shit . what did she know , big dummy ...
sometimes you do .
you get to travel around and stuff ? i mean , better places then this ?
i think so .
is that a pretty good job , fbi agent ?
she died . she went to florida to retire , like two years ago ? she dies own there .
where does mrs. lippman live ? i 'd like to talk to her .
oh sure , me'n pam malavesi used to help her do alterations for old mrs. lippman . lots of people worked for her , she had the business from all these retail stores ? but she was like , totally old , it was more'n she could handle .
did you ever work with her ?
no way . she had a guy , i'da known , believe me . sewing was her life , she was really great at it . poor freddie .
stacy , did fredrica ever mention a man named jamie gumb ? or john grant ? do you think she could 've had a friend you did n't know about ?
they said she was just rags , like somebody -
goodbye , clarice ... you looked - so very lovely today , in your blue suit .
you know i ca n't make that promise .
i have no plans to call on you , clarice , the world being more interesting with you in it . be sure you extend me the same courtesy .
dr. lecter -
your lambs are still for now , clarice , but not forever ... you 'll have to earn it again and again , this blessed silence . because it 's the plight that drives you , and the plight will never end .
well , clarice , have the lambs stopped screaming ... ?
starling .
promise ... ? then why not take your case file ? i wo n't be needing it anymore .
yes . i 'll tell you .
brave clarice . will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming ?
dr. chilton ... i believe you know each other ?
tell me his name , dr. lecter .
thank you , clarice .
yes ! i do n't know ... ! i do n't know .
do you think if you saved catherine , you could make them stop ... ? do you think , if catherine lives , you wo n't wake up in the dark , ever again , to the screaming of the lambs ? do you ... ?
yes ...
you still wake up sometimes , do n't you ? wake up in the dark , with the lambs screaming ?
but what became of your lamb ? clarice ... ?
i did n't get more than a few miles before the sheriff 's car found me . the rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the lutheran orphanage in bozeman . i never saw the ranch again ...
i do n't know . i had no food or water . it was very cold . i thought - if i can even save just one ... but he got so heavy . so heavy ...
where were you going ?
i took one lamb . and i ran away , as fast as i could ...
but you could . you did .
no . first i tried to free them ... i opened the gate of their pen - but they would n't run . they just stood there , confused . they would n't run ...
so you ran away ...
yes ... ! they were screaming .
they were slaughtering the spring lambs ?
got dressed without turning on the light . i went downstairs ... outside ...
what did you do ?
what was it ?
i heard a strange sound ...
then something woke you . what ? did you dream ... ? what was it ?
early . still dark .
not `` just , '' clarice . what set you off ? you started what time ?
and - one morning i just - ran away ...
i 'll listen now . after your father 's murder , you were orphaned . you were ten years old . you went to live with cousins , on a sheep and horse ranch in montana . and - ?
later , listen , i 'll -
we do n't reckon time the same way , clarice . this is all the time you 'll ever have .
dr. lecter , when there 's time i 'll -
no . it 's your turn to tell me , clarice . you do n't have any more vacations to sell , on anthrax island . why did you run away from that ranch ?
all right , then tell me how -
no . precisely . we begin by coveting what we see every day . do n't you feel eyes moving over your body , clarice ? i hardly see how you could n't . and do n't your eyes move over the things you want ?
no . we just -
no , he covets . that 's his nature . and how do we begin to covet , clarice ? do we seek out things to covet ? make an effort to answer .
anger , social resentment , sexual frus-
what is the first and principal thing he does , what need does he serve by killing ?
no ! that 's incidental .
he kills w-
first principles , clarice . simplicity . read marcus aurelius . of each particular thing , ask : what is it , in itself , what is its nature ... ? what does he do , this man you seek ?
then tell me how .
i 've studied the case file , have you ... ? everything you need to find him is right in these pages . whatever his name is .
i think you were telling me the truth in baltimore - or starting to . tell me the rest now .
clarice ... you 're hardly in a position to accuse me of lying .
dr. lecter , you find out everything . you could n't have talked with this `` william rubin '' , even once , and come out knowing so little about him ... you made him up , did n't you ?
nobody sent me . i came on my own .
how very thoughtful ... or did crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you 're both booted off the case ?
i thought you might want your drawings back ... just until you get your view .
yes , doctor . please .
that 's enough , i think . happy hunting . oh , and clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away . shall i summarize ?
how would he test ?
the personality inventories would trip him up . rorschach , wechsler , house-tree-person ... he would n't test like a real transsexual .
on what basis would they reject him ?
there are three major centers for transsexual surgery : johns hopkins , the university of minnesota , and columbus medical center . i would n't be surprised if billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them , and been rejected .
you said - i was very close to the way we 'd catch him .
billy 's not a real transsexual , but he thinks he is . he tries to be . he 's tried to be a lot of things , i expect .
no ... ! quid pro quo , doctor .
did he try to ?
no .
why , clarice ? did the rancher fuck you ?
i - ran away ...
why so briefly ?
two months .
how long did you live there ?
horses - and sheep ...
a cattle ranch ?
i went to live with my mother 's cousin and her husband in montana . they had a ranch .
after your father 's death , you were orphaned . what happened next ? i do n't imagine the answer 's on those second-rate shoes , clarice .
no . tell me why .
clever girl . you 're so close to the way you 're going to catch him - do you realize that ?
dr. lecter , there 's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence . transsexuals are very passive .
the significance of the moth is change . caterpillar into cocoon into beauty ... billy wants to change , too , clarice . but there 's the problem of his size , you see . even if he were a woman , he 'd have to be a big one ...
quid pro quo , doctor .
you 're very frank , clarice . i think - it would be quite something to know you in private life .
no . he was strong , he lasted almost a month . my mother - died when i was very young , so my father had become - the whole world to me ... after he left me , i had nobody . i was ten years old .
killed outright ?
he was a town marshal ... one night he surprised two burglars , coming out the back of a drugstore ... they shot him .
tell me . do n't lie , or i 'll know .
the death of my father .
what 's your worst memory of childhood ? quicker than that . i 'm not interested in your worst invention .
go , doctor .
terns ... if i help you , clarice , it will be `` turns '' with us , too . quid pro quo . i tell you things , you tell me things . not about this case , though - about yourself . yes or no ? yes or no , clarice . catherine is waiting . tick-tock , tick-tock ...
that 's just part of the island . it has a very nice beach . terns nest there .
`` plum island animal disease research center . '' sounds charming .
i 'm waiting for your offer , clarice . enchant me .
a moth ... how did you predict that ?
was it a butterfly ?
she had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat . that has n't been made public yet . we do n't know what is means .
mmm . and what else ... ?
they all were .
big through the hips . roomy .
yes .
life 's too slippery for books , clarice . typhoid and swans came from the same god . tell me , miss west virginia - was she a large girl ?
by the book , he 's a sadist .
that is both impudent and untrue ... tell me , how did you feel when you viewed our billy 's latest effort ? or should i say , his `` next-to-latest '' ?
i was your choice , dr. lecter . you chose to speak to me . would you prefer someone else now ? or perhaps you do n't think you can help us .
buffalo bill ... ? bill killed him , all those years ago ... ? that 's impossible .
oh , a very naughty boy . someone you and jack crawford are most anxious to meet .
who killed your patient ?
i 've been in this room for eight years , clarice . i know they will never , ever let me out while i 'm alive . what i want is a view . i want a window where i can see a tree , or even water . i want to be in a federal institution , away from chilton - and i want a view . i 'll give good value for it . crawford could do that for me , but he wo n't . you persuade him .
who killed raspail , doctor ... ? you know , do n't you ?
punishment , you see . for miggs . just like that gospel program . when you leave , they 'll turn the volume way up . chilton does enjoy his petty torments .
or does n't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of ... negotiation ? there 's something crawford can give me , and i want to trade for it . i even wrote to him , offering my help . but he hates me , so he wo n't deal directly .
i do n't know . is it ?
not anymore . surely the odd confluence of events has n't escaped you , clarice . crawford dangles you before me . then i give you a bit of help . do you think it 's because i like to look at you , and imagine how good you would taste ... ?
that does n't interest me , doctor . and it 's the sort of thing miggs would ask .
your first lie to me , clarice . how sad . tell me - do you think crawford wants you , sexually ? true , he 's much older , but - do you think he visualizes ... scenarios , exchanges ... ? fucking you ?
i never thought about it .
jack crawford is helping your career , is n't he ? apparently he likes you . and you like him , too .
i do n't know . next time i 'll have to check .
do you have something you use , when you need to get up your courage ? memories , tableaux ... scenes from your early life ?
because you were n't wasting my time .
ahhh ... why ?
scared , at first . then - exhilarated .
and have them clomping about in my life ? oh dear , no ... at that time i still had certain private amusements of my own . how did you feel when you saw him , clarice ? may i call you clarice ?
would n't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find ?
who can say ... ? best thing for him , really . his therapy was going nowhere .
if you did n't kill him , then who did ?
his real name is benjamin raspail . a former patient of mine , whose romantic attachments ran to , shall we say , the exotic ... ? i did n't kill him , merely tucked him away . very much as i found him , in that ridiculous car , in his own garage , after he 's missed three appointments . you 'd have him under `` missing person '' - which , in poor raspail 's case , could hardly be more true .
why do n't you tell me about `` miss mofet ? '' you wanted me to find him . or do i have to wait for the lab ?
i might if i saw the case file . you could get that for me .
why ? do you know something about him ?
why do n't you ask me about buffalo bill ?
how did - it 's nothing . a scratch .
your bleeding has stopped .
advancement , of course . go to split city . see miss mofet , an old patient of mine . m-o-f-e-t ... now go . go . i do n't think miggs could manage again so soon , even if he is crazy - do you ?
what 's that , dr. lecter ?
no . but i will make you happy ... i 'll give you a chance for what you love most , clarice starling .
then please - do this test for me .
i would not have had that happen to you . discourtesy is - unspeakably ugly to me .
a census taker once tried to test me . i ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti ... fly back to school , little starling .
and the questionnaire ... ?
and you 'd hate to think you were common . my , would n't that sting ! well you 're far from common , officer starling . all you have is the fear of it . now please excuse me . good day .
reasonably so . yes .
you 're a tough one , are n't you ?
you see a lot , dr. lecter . but are you strong enough to point that high- powered perception at yourself ? how about it ... ? look at yourself and write down the truth . or maybe you 're afraid to .
no . i only hoped that your knowledge -
oh , officer starling ... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool ?
no . you ate yours .
i did n't .
it excites him . most serial killers keep some sort of trophies .
witless and misleading . why do you think he takes their skins , officer starling ? thrill me with your wisdom .
i 'll tell you if you 'll look at this form . it started as a bad joke in kansas city homicide . they said ... this one likes to skin his humps .
do you know why he 's called buffalo bill ? tell me . the newspapers wo n't say .
partially , yes . but doctor , that 's an active case , i 'm not involved . if -
all flayed ... ?
five ... so far .
how many women has he used , our bill ?
no , i came because we need -
jack crawford must be very busy indeed if he 's recruiting help from the student body . busy hunting that new one , buffalo bill ... such a naughty boy ! did crawford send you to ask for my advice on him ?
i 'm only asking you to look at this , doctor . either you will or you wo n't .
no , no , no . you were doing fine , you 'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy , you 'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about miggs , and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire . it wo n't do . it 's stupid and boring .
dr. lecter , if you 'd please consider -
memory , officer starling , is what i have instead of view .
all that detail , just from memory ... ?
yes . that 's the duomo , seen from the belvedere . do you know florence ?
did you do those drawings , doctor ?
i have no doubt of it .
maybe they 'll catch up .
it 's much better than your shoes .
yes .
i see . i myself can not . you use evyan skin cream , and sometimes you wear l'air du temps , but not today . you brought your best bag , though , did n't you ?
he said - `` i can smell your cunt . ''
now then . what did miggs say to you ? `` multiple miggs , '' in the next cell . he hissed at you . what did he say ?
mmmmm ... that 's rather slippery of you , officer starling . sit . please .
we 're talking about psychology , doctor , not the bureau . can you decide for yourself whether or not i 'm qualified ?
jack crawford sent a trainee to me ?
i 'm - still in training at the academy .
that expires in one week . you 're not real fbi , are you ?
may i see your credentials ?
i am , yes .
`` we '' being the behavioral science unit , at quantico . you 're one of jack crawford 's , i expect .
doctor , we have a hard problem in psychological profiling . i want to ask for your help with a questionnaire .
would you , doctor ? that would be so kind .
it may be that - i could confer with my colleagues on this . and get back to you .
oh , that 's clever , dr. danielson . very humorous . you like the truth ? try this . he kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off . we do n't want him to do that anymore . if you do n't help me , just as fast as you can , then the justice department is going to ask publicly for a court order , we 'll ask twice a day , just in time for the morning and evening news . and each one of our press conferences will focus on dr. danielson , over at johns hopkins , and how we 're still hoping for his cooperation . and every time there 's any news on the case - when catherine martin floats , when the next one floats , and the next one - why , we 'll just issue another press release about good ol ' dr. danielson , over at johns hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks .
i doubt very much that the fbi or any other government agency can keep a secret , mr. crawford . truth will out ... and then what ? will you give johns hopkins a new identity ? put a big pair of sunglasses on this building , and a funny nose ?
look ... search your own records , if you prefer . you can do it a lot faster than us , anyway . if we find buffalo bill through your information , i 'll suppress it . nobody has to know this hospital cooperated .
that 's a childish , bullying stunt , mr. crawford . i was a battlefield surgeon , so you can put away your picture .
her name is kimberly jane emberg , she was just id 'd . i met her on a slab in west virginia . and sometime tomorrow , or tomorrow night , he 's going to do the same thing to catherine martin .
you want to see a violation ? this is a violation ...
examination and interview materials are confidential . we 've never violated an applicant 's trust , and we never will .
dr. danielson , the man we want was never your patient . it would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence . please , doctor - time is eating us up . just show me the ones you 've turned away .
i 'm not having a witch hunt here , mr. crawford ! our patients are decent , non-violent people with a real problem .
oh , and senator ... ? love you suit .
thank you , doctor . i 'll keep it in mind .
senator martin ... ! you ca n't trust jack crawford or clarice starling . it 's such a game with these people . they 're determined to get the arrest for themselves . the `` collar , '' i think they say .
let 's go with it .
toughened your nipples , did n't it ... ? six foot one , strongly built , about 190 pounds . hair brown , eyes pale blue . he 'd be about 35 now . he said he lived in philadelphia , but may have lied . that 's really all i can remember , senator - but if i think of any more , i 'll let you know .
yes ... i did .
did you breast-feed her ?
what ... ?
you have my word . paul ?
i wo n't waste your time and catherine 's time bargaining for petty privileges . clarice starling and that awful jack crawford have wasted far too much already . i only pray they have n't doomed the poor girl ... let me help you now , and i 'll trust you when it 's all over .
the latin name comes from two rivers in hell . your man - he drops these girls into rivers , every time . did n't i read that ?
better known to his friends as the death's-head moth ...
just ignore him . he 's not a ph.d .
i 'm the one who found his perforating proboscis ! are you wearing a gun , right now ? ooh , cool ! can i see it ? can i ?
your west virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble , but i finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin .
officer starling . welcome back .
of course it counts . how do you play ?
no fair ! you lured him with produce .
time , pilch ! my move .
duncan , you are absolutely gallant . if cora does n't marry you , i shall .
the men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake , build fires and provide every comfort you desire , alice ...
absolutely .
can we rest soon ?
are you alright ?
i wo n't sleep tonight . what an adventure ! i absolutely can not wait to return to portman square , having laid eyes upon the full-blooded , red men in the wild !
yes , miss .
we leave in the morning ? !
my god , you 've grown up .
winter with the delaware , my father 's cousins . and in the spring , cross the ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called can-tuck-ee .
where will we go ?
i have nothing to go back for .
will you go back to england ?
alice ?
and my compliments to you ...
... never doubt what you are doing .
listen . submit . you hear me ? you 're strong . you stay alive . i will find you ... no matter how far , how long it takes ...
yes . i want you to go .
in this there is a chance . if i live , i can try to free you . if we do n't go , there is no powder , there 's too many of them . though my heart would keep me here , in that there is no chance . none . i can do nothing . do you understand ?
our father ? did you see my father ?
maybe ...
are we safe ?
i do n't know . whatever happens you stay with your father . you stay among the officers .
what is it ?
do not . promise me .
no . i will find you .
webb 's reinforcements will arrive or not . if they do not arrive , the fort will fall . if that happens , stay close to your father . the french will protect the officer class among the english .
what would you have me do ?
because what i am interested in is right here ...
they 're going to hang you . why did n't you leave when you had the chance ?
why , i am looking at you , miss .
what are you looking at , mr. poe ?
miss . may i ?
mr poe ?
top of this ridge . fort and lake george are downhill of it .
much further ?
on the contrary . it is more deeply stirring ... to my blood ... ... than any imagining could possibly have been ...
sorry to disappoint you ...
you are right , mr. poe . we do not understand what is happening here . and it is not as i imagined it would be , thinking of it in boston and london ...
'cos frontier land 's the only land affordable to poor people . so after seven years indentured service in virginia , they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin ' by another 's leave ... their name was cameron . john & alexandria .
in london those radical ideas could land you in newgate prison . why were those people living in this defenseless place ... ?
the bible . monarchy . many wrong ideas about the government of men . my father 's people already know each man is his own nation . and only he can have dominion over himself . not kings . no man is better than any other man .
and what were the consequentialities of european culture you did n't bother with ?
my father sent uncas & i to reverend wheelock 's school when i was ten . so we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin ' & arithmetic from yours .
how did you learn english ?
i do not remember them . i was one or two .
i 'm sorry .
they buried my ma & pa and my sisters . and chingachgook - who found me with two french trappers - raised me up as his own .
thank you so much .
in your particular case , miss , i would make some allowance ...
`` we 're a breed apart and we make no sense '' ... ?
why did they turn back ?
the ottawa are gone .
yes . and `` do not try to understand them . that is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense ... ''
what ? !
yes . he said ... `` do not try to make them understand you . ''
he did ?
chingachgook . he warned me about people like you .
your `` father '' ?
well that is to be expected . my father ...
you were acting for our benefit . and i apologize . i misunderstood you .
you knew them .
anyone lookin ' to pick up our trail , would see it as a sign of our passing ...
why did n't you bury those people ?
i will not . i have seen the face of war before , mr. poe , but never war made on women and children . and almost as cruel is your indifference .
let us go , miss .
though they are strangers , they are at least entitled to a christian burial !
yes i do ! i know exactly what i am saying . and if it is sedition , then i am guilty of sedition , too !
you do not know what you are saying !
`` justice '' ? if that 's `` justice '' ... , then the sooner french guns blow the english army out of america , the better it will be for these people .
but the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon .
he knew the consequences . and he stayed . are those the actions of a criminal ? ... duncan , do something .
the man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room , in my presence . he is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal , regardless of what he did for my children .
i sent three men to webb !
there was no letter .
what ?
there was none !
my letter ...
when ? how ?
told you to stay away from this hell hole ! why did you disobey me ?
what are they doing to duncan ? duncan !
... compliments , mr. poe . take her and get out .
what the bloody hell plan is this ?
yes . go ahead .
you are defending him because you 've become infatuated with him .
they do not live their lives `` by your leave . '' ... they hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands , burying their dead and their children along the way .
you know he would n't send me ... ! you misrepresented what you saw and caused this . i , too , was at that farm . it was as he said ...
he knew the penalty for breaking regulations . he ought to pay without sending you to beg .
munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests .
beyond the periphery of men , staring at him .
i am sorry , duncan ...
i see ...
duncan ... duncan , i promised you an answer . you have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... but the decision i 've come to is i 'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment .
cora , i adore you and , when we come together , we will be the happiest couple in england ... i am certain of that . more than ever before . i believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ...
he delivered no such message .
one called magua arrived .
it can be dangerous ...
my god , alice .
yes . yes , i will .
will you consider that ?
cora , in my heart , i know once we 're joined , we 'll be the happiest couple in england . let those whom you trust , your father , help settle what 's best for you . in view of your indecision , why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine ?
cousin eugenie , my father , but ...
`` some '' ?
some say that 's the way of it .
is n't respect and friendship , a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined ? and all else may grow in time ... ?
dear duncan , my affection is as towards a closest friend . alice and i depend on you and respect you immensely ... i wish they did , but my feelings do n't go beyond that . do you see ?
aversion ? no ... `` hatred '' ... `` loathing '' ...
you still have an aversion to the water ?
and by sea !
i 'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so long apart and after you 've traveled so far ...
: only one or two loads .
any powder ?
you will have to forego the pleasure of hangin ' me .
and if we 're unlucky ?
then we take the south rim down the mountain and it 's 12 miles cross country to fort edward .
then what ?
this is it , as far as we can go ... if we 're lucky , they 'll be figurin ' we ca n't have come this way and must 've beached our canoes and headed cross land . if we 're very lucky , they 'll figure we went over the falls .
i do n't understand !
we do n't .
where do we go from here ?
do you hear me , sir ! if you ever fall ... into british hands ... what white water ?
head for ... for the white water .
only chance we got is ... ... to get more distance on 'em and go to ground !
how long ?
major ! some day i think you and i are gon na have a serious disagreement .
i ought to have you whipped from this fort !
that is the truth !
that is sedition ! treason !
and if english law can not be trusted , maybe these people would do better makin ' a peace with the french !
excuse me ...
ottawa !
who were these people ?
do not let gratitude get in the way ...
i owe you gratitude or i 'd call you out !
england does not protect me and does not war against france on our account . she uses us to war against france on her own account ... of greed for land and furs .
then you are one of those who would allow england to fight alone while she protects you from france ?
i ai n't your `` scout '' . and i am in no damn militia .
i thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia ?
no . headin ' west . to can-tuck-ee .
fort edward , then ?
no .
then you 're assigned to fort william henry ?
came across the war party , tracked 'em .
of course not ! and how is it you were nearby ?
no blood vengeance ? no re-proach or insult ?
miss cora munro . he never set eyes on her before today .
dark haired ...
what ? !
he is huron and nothing else . why would he want to murder the girl ?
colonel munro sent him . he was one of our mohawk allies .
day and a half where did you get ... the guide ?
how far is it , scout ?
... fort william henry .
we were headed ...
your wounded should try walkin ' back to albany . they 'll never make a passage north .
... no ... do not call myself much of a subject at all .
you , sir ! you call yourself a loyal subject ?
you do what you want with your own scalp . do not be tellin ' us what to do with ours .
... and while they are cooped up in your fort , what if the french send war parties to raid their homes ?
will you men help us stop the french ?
first place , you started it with the french over fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio . now you 're sayin ' these people have a fight on their hands ...
really ? do you want them to overrun all new york colony ?
i said ... france is your enemy . not ours .
what did you say ?
your enemy ...
it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy .
it does and it is a better lookin ' reason than you , jack winthrop . push hard , 'cos you got to clear the french outpost by dawn . good luck , jack .
that reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery ?
got a reason to stay .
you 're not coming with us ?
i 'll cover them from the top of the casement .
out the northern sally-port . strike for the east side of the swamp until you clear the french picket line . head north over the ridge , then come about southeast and fork left in little meadow and you 're free of the outpost and skirmishers ...
i believe if they set aside their law as and when they wish , their law no longer has rightful authority over us . all they have over us is tyranny , then . and i 'll stay here no longer . no force on earth will keep me here ... anyone caught leavin ' the fort could be shot . so each man make your own decision ... those who are goin ' , be back here in an hour .
we 'll see in the morning ...
folks here goin ' to join in that fight ?
a french & indian army out of fort carillon 's heading south to war against the english . i 'm here to raise this county 's militia to aid the british defense .
so what is it , jack ? what brings you up here ?
tradin ' your skins in castleton ?
that we did . john . but the horicane is near trapped out .
would the huron make his algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man ? would the huron have greed for more land than a man can use ? like francais black robes do ? would huron kill tribes with disease ? would the huron fool seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy ? but sell the fur to the white man for gold ? ... those are the ways of yengeese and les francais masters . are they the ways of huron men who hunt & work the land ? or of dogs ? ... magua 's heart is twisted . he would make himself into what twisted him . a dog , become master of dogs . but are hurons dogs ? ... magua 's way is false . it is like the white sickness . magua 's way will bring only sadness and shame . is there another way ? i do n't know . i am nathaniel of the yengeese ; hawkeye , adopted son of chingachgook , of the mohican people ... let the children of the dead munro go free ... i speak the truth .
the red man put down the bow , picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest . yes . it is the only way .
magua would use the ways of les francais and the yengeese ...
no . huron serve no one . the french father believes he fooled magua because he is so proud of his cleverness , he is blind . but it is the huron path that magua walks down , not the french one ... now , les francais , also , fear huron . that is good . when the huron is strong from their fear , we will make the terms of trade with les francais . and we will trade as the white man trades . take land from the abnakes ; fur from the osage , sauk & fox . and make the huron great . over other tribes . no less than the whites , as strong as the whites .
so the huron are the servants of the french ? to do what the french are shamed to do ?
wise one , the french fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship . magua broke it . it is false that the french would not be friends , still , to the huron .
our father , montcalm , is greater than the yengeese in the arts of war . the huron do not fear english anger .
let the children of the dead colonel munro go free and take the fire out of the english anger over the murder of their helpless ones .
you forget yourself !
easy for you to suppose . while it is their women and children , not yours , alone in their farms !
i 'll have none of that ! montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman . not a butcher .
what did you see , major ?
that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms & families ... major heyward was at john cameron 's . he saw what it was .
that 's all , sir .
many men here , their homes are in the path .
it was a war party . it means they 're on the attack up and down the frontier .
yes , mr. poe ? so ?
... not enough time to get to albany and back with reinforcements ...
a man , here , can make a run straight through to webb .
what else ?
help ourselves to a few horns from your powder stores .
by your leave , sir .
the scotsman 's daughters are at the poltroon 's house . a company of the 33rd will accompany you and magua will show you the way .
yes . you may . you there . what does munro call you ? the `` scotsman '' has sent one of his indian allies to guide you .
sir ! ... might i inquire if general webb has heard from colonel munro 's daughters ? i was to rendezvous with them in albany and escort them to the fort .
you will take command of the 62nd regiment of foot . at fort william henry under colonel munro . i will march the 33rd to fort edward .
i thought british policy is 'make the world ... england ' , sir .
i know . one has to give americans `` reasons '' and make agreements to get them to do anything at all . tiring , is n't it ? but that 's the way of it here .
the crown `` negotiating '' the terms of service ?
and what is that ?
i did n't experience anything so surprising from bristol to albany as what i witnessed here today .
the decision is final .
sir !
death and honor are sometimes thought to be the same . today i have learned that they are not .
general webb can burn in hell . we 'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts ! our mission is to fight .
i have lived to see two things i never expected . an englishman afraid to support a friend . and a frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage .
you have heard your answer , monsieur le marquis .
this is the signature of webb . and i know the temper of our men . rather than spend the war in a french prison hulk in hudson bay , they 'd fight to the end .
and who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon england 's policies in her own colonies ? to come and go without so much as a `` by your leave . ''
not with enough certainty to outweigh british interests in this fort .
terrible feature of war in the americas . best to keep your sight fixed on our duty .
things were done . nobody was spared ...
only twelve miles away ! he could be here day after tomorrow . find your man , sir ! captain beams will give you the message .
yes , sir .
webb 's at edward ?
webb 's not in albany . he marched the 33rd to fort edward two days ago .
logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them . they keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of trench a day . his thirteen inch mortars have a two hundred yard range , so when they 're close enough , they 'll move them in , lob explosive rounds over our walls and pound us to dust . they look to be three hundred yards out . bloody murderers . you have three days .
might i enquire after the situation , sir , given that i 've seen of the french engineering from the ridge above ?
what a place for them ...
thank you . how can i reward you ?
ambush ... on the george road . this magua led us into it . ... eighteen killed . it 's these men who saved us . they guided us here ...
what happened to you ?
sir . webb has no idea . and he certainly does not know to send reinforcements !
does webb not even know we are besieged ?
fire !
right - about face ! march ! first rank present !
yes sir !
men are to stay in file , sergeant major !
atten-hut !
thank you , sergeant major . thank the men .
sir !
sergeant major !
fire ! ! !
shoulder arms ! present !
sir ! ! ! third rank ! twelve paces ! forward march !
advance , sergeant major !
fire ! ! !
first rank ! second rank ! present arms !
sir ! upon the center , wheel to the left- about ! march ! rear ranks , proper distance ! front ranks , take your distance ! march ! halt ! make ready !
sergeant ! form three ranks !
heart . give magua new heart .
what is enough ?
the king ? the king has mountains of gold !
how much gold has the master of the yengeese ?
yes .
for munro children ?
gold could be arranged .
yengeese major give all property to magua . magua give yengeese major much wampum , many gifts , maybe three , four oxen .
yes .
does yengeese major have property across salt sea ?
yes .
wampum ?
three , four oxen ... much wampum .
gifts ?
if magua give women to yengeese soldiers ... will receive many gifts .
magua say : `` yes . good idea . ''
excuse me . what did you say ?
`` magua understand paleface is a dog to his women . when his women want to eat , he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness . ''
no . stop in the glade just ahead ! when the ladies are rested , we will proceed . do you understand ?
i understand . this is not good place to stop . two leagues from here . no water 'til then . that where we stop . better place .
we must ... stop ... soon . women are ... tired . you ... understand ?
does the rule of english law no longer govern ? has it been replaced by absolutism ?
this interview 's over ! the militia stays !
nathaniel 's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here !
british promises are honored . and the militia will not be released . because i need more definite proof than this man 's word !
we are not forgettin ' webb 's promise !
i judge military matters , captain winthrop , not you .
chingachgook 's of the same opinion . taken together , that 's gospel . your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements , not these colonials ' presence .
i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe 's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw .
many things my french father can not do , magua can .
munro would . but general webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake . having let them go , i fear i will only fight the same men again when i move south . and yet , i can not break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of france ...
does the chief of the canadas believe the english will keep the terms ?
my son magua 's pain is my pain .
magua slept hard in the english wigwams . and the sticks left their mark ... magua 's village and lodges were burnt . magua 's children were killed by the english . magua was taken as a slave by the mohawks who fought for the grey hair . magua 's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another . the grey hair was the father of all this . in time magua became blood-brother to mohawk to become free . in his heart he always was huron . and his heart will be whole again on the day when the grey hair and all his seed are dead !
my son has been sadly injured . who did this ?
and this ?
that 's where a lead bullet has torn you .
that le renard has the power to lead his people into the light , i know well .
where is that sun ? ! it has gone behind the hill . it is dark and cold . it has set on his people , they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the european masters who are always greedy for more than they need . and le subtil is the son of his tribe . there have been many clouds and many mountains . but now he has come to lead his nation .
but so many suns have set since le renard struck the war post . is he not tired ?
magua took the hatchet to color it with blood . it is still bright . only when it is red , then it will be buried .
my master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the english squatters . they have consented to go . so now he calls them enemies no longer .
not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends .
yes .
is the hatchet buried between the english and my french father ?
when the grey hair is dead , magua will eat his heart . before he dies magua will put his children under the knife so the grey hair will see his seed is wiped out forever .
why do hate the grey hair , magua ?
granted , monsieur .
i am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity ... the fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead , prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon .
allow me to consult with my officers .
carry them to england to your king with pride .
my colors ?
granted .
the honors of war ?
they may leave the fortress fully armed , but with no ammunition ... other than that , ask what you wish .
their arms ?
my master requires the fort be destroyed . but , for you and your comrades , there is no privilege that will be denied . none of your men will see the inside of a prison barge . they 're free to go so long as they return to england and fight no more on this continent , and the civilian militia return to their farms .
such as ... ?
perhaps the general 's glasses can reach to the hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of webb ... ?
honor that is freely accorded to courage , may be refused obstinacy ... these hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and i am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves . is webb really en route and montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before british reinforcements arrive ?
however i may apprise such testimony from monsieur montcalm , fort william henry is strong and stands .
you have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your prince . i will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope . but now , i beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity . i beg you to consider my terms for your surrender .
monsieur le marquis , i am a soldier , not a diplomat . you called this parlay for a reason .
please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress . under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material ... mere chance has allowed me to array against you ...
and i to make yours , monsieur le marquis .
colonel munro , i have known you as a gallant antagonist . i am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend .
il est necessaire d'etre vigilant , mon enfant .
c'est bien , vous vous promenez bien matin , monsieur !
la victoire .
le mot d'ordre ?
france .
qui vive ?
do n't worry , i do n't want to give up any more .
be careful with it .
intelligence may not be the right word ...
that it acquires intelligence from its victims ?
well , if they were perfecting an aquaman , then why 's there a dead one onboard that russian ship ? why is n't he out swimming around ?
why stop with just one aspect of marine life ? why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer ? ...
but what about those scales ... or that leech-like thing that bit cobb ?
some say that 's why we 're basically hairless , for less water resistance , faster swimming speeds ...
it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water . most homo sapiens did n't make it ... danakil man ... < u > adapted < /u > .
not exactly a big ocean country .
danakil man ? ... one of our ancestors . named for the danakil alps in ethiopia .
was there such a thing ?
no . i think they isolated him in genetic engineering . homo aquaticus ...
they found this ?
yeah ... right ...
it could be a million things , something in the air , food ... . but he went on that ship and so did williams ... i want to examine the crew .
why sixpack ?
and they did n't believe the symptoms i described ...
and ?
i do n't know . i 've been back and forth with narragansett naval all day , consulting with the best people in maritime medicine , the best people in viruses ...
the mask is because you think it might be ... catching ?
for this ... you do n't need to be .
i 'm not a doctor .
here . put this on . you examine him .
well , how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours ? !
he did .
dead ? this morning you said he had some skin disorder .
pretty good imitation of a hangover and i ought to know .
what 's wrong ?
what mistakes ? look , i think it 's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have maritime run a check .
these observers were doing something . a test ... i think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes .
what do you want me to say ? that it all sounds mysterious ?
be my guest .
you mind if i take a look at this ?
we almost had an accident today . dejesus ' suit ...
well , i 'll be on the golf course in the morning . then , if i do n't have any babies to deliver --
are you planning on working tomorrow ?
just get in yours !
your suit , becky !
i got hung up ! try this !
where the hell 've you been ?
fuck your orders !
that 's an order !
no !
go on !
no .
i hit it . but i ca n't see it ! can you see it ? !
i am thinking , man ! you think i want to die ! i am thinking ! i --
think ! can we stop it ? ! block it up ? ! shut down the line somewhere ? ! think !
no way ...
can you fix it ?
jesus christ ...
crunch ... implosion .
we do n't have much choice ... without air , the internal pressure will fall and --
what dead one on the ship ?
that 's why there 's a dead one on the ship . it ran out of blood .
he did .
no , it 's not going through . the intercom 's busted . i thought dejesus fixed that ?
were , doss < u > were < /u > .
i thought they were your friends ?
one of those chunks of sixpack ! like a big leech , with those teeth ! ...
what has ?
it 's got hazy !
there 's now a problem with the weather for pickup . there 's a typhoon in our sector ... ... we 're going to be delayed twelve hours ...
we 're getting out of here just in time .
what ? ...
bullshit ... i was just talking to him . i saw him move .
... all of you owe time and i thought tonight would be a good time to -- -
uh , oh ... i see where this is going ...
i 've been looking at the duty roster ... at the shack hours outstanding ...
the good doctor has n't showed yet .
doc eat already ?
stay calm !
he do n't need a readout , man , he needs help !
dejesus ! a readout !
all right , sixpack , you and williams are gon na pull water duty tomorrow --
huh ? i ... uh ... uh ...
how do you know it was williams ?
look at my foot , sir ! this bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk !
williams ... get dejesus ' suit on the `` sick rack '' and do a diagnostics . any other suit problems she should know about ?
shit ...
cobb , jones , i want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system ... bowman and sixpack ... living quarters ...
i ca n't see them !
it hit me ! where are they ? !
where 's jones ?
we made it !
ca n't we fix it ?
less than an hour . it 's ruptured an air duct .
how much time does that give us ?
we 're on backup air .
seeing how my stock 's doing ...
what are you doing ?
maybe they already have .
yeah ... i think they 're just deciding what to do with us .
they know , do n't they ?
the escape bubbles ?
shit ! he sent them all .
our only chance is to lure it to the swamp and flush it like we did the other .
what can we do ?
maybe you 're more one of us than you think ... sir .
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that 's what i would 've done .
well , i always heard you do n't `` learn '' leadership , you earn it . how did you know they 'd get into the vodka ?
you think i should hang around more with the crew ?
has it helped ?
everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line . sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something .
i need electrical field experience on my resume . everything helps ... why are you here ?
whatever made you want to do a tour down here ?
good ... it 's going good .
no . i 'm just being friendly .
why ? you going to give me hard time like the others ?
how 's astronaut training ?
after a month of it you 'd think i 'd be used to it .
that was a loud one was n't it ?
why ca n't we pick up his signal ?
sixpack ?
you screw around like that again and --
that 's great . now let 's move 35 degrees southwest .
roger ... more light , sixpack ...
i need more light on that , four .
still ... you did the right thing .
there probably was n't anything wrong with his suit ...
today ... with dejesus . that was smart thinking to get him inside ...
what ?
you did good ...
jones ... come with me . cobb , you and doc check the rooms .
oh , god , she 's out there ...
it bit me !
no !
mr. beck , the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of -- -
shut up , all of you .
no sir ... i just wanted to know if you needed a hand ?
is this a contract violation , mr. cobb ?
excuse me , sir ...
all right ...
... i 'd really have to show it to you .
what 's wrong with it ?
uh..excuse me sir , it 's the air recirculating system , sir ...
something wrong , cobb ?
you 're only twenty-five tons off quota . barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day . it 's just a day off . you do n't have to take it , i just thought it might help .
what about our quota ?
he 's not at his station .
where 's doc ? !
the internal monitors read normal .
roger .
wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit ...
twenty minutes ! ... who had tank duty ?
twenty minutes ...
what 's your air reading ?
i 'm going inside .
charge set . backing off . c'mon rover let 's get out of here .
charge set ?
no ... she killed herself .
and it killed bo ?
i ca n't tell you much about it , except that none of you show any symptoms .
let 's get it out of here and bring in a new one .
okay , number 23 's full .
better let the doc take a look at you , after dinner .
okay .
how do you feel , dejesus ?
ahhhh !
give me a readout , dejesus .
i realize you must have gone through hell --
forty-eight hours !
twelve hours , no big deal . we should know something first thing in the morning . do n't worry .
but it 's a delay ! how long ? a day ? two days ? !
it should n't be a long delay .
what 're you saying ? that we 're not even going to be picked up tomorrow ?
unfortunately . we ca n't .
do it .
beck , trust me . if the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup . we could be there in a few hours .
i 'm not anxious to find out , either .
but you do n't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ?
what you do n't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy .
well , according to maritime law , you , as commander of the shack have the authority to dispose of the body . however , the company does n't want you to do that .
beautiful .
how 's the weather for pickup tomorrow ?
well , suit yourself , then ... its your decision ... ha ha ... a little joke ... suit yourself ...
i know that .
... as long as you know it 's not in your contract .
do n't thank me , yet , but it is important to know where you 're going and who your friends are ... 'know what i mean ?
thank you , martin .
sounds like a good week , beck . in fact ... i put your folder in front of the vice president of district operations last night ...
two hundred and fifty-two tons of magnesium and 15 tons of sodium .
timex ...
personal effects ...
you 're damn right i do . five years down here and i 'll pull in more than 15 topside . i 'm not down here for the fun , i 'll tell you that .
you take your money , too seriously , bo .
i signed-up for the stock option .
you got money in this tub ?
how 's transocean doing ?
not yet .
made your million , yet ?
hook 's on 24 ...
yes sir ...
aw , loosen up , bowman ... hey , willie , i got one served up for you .
cute , dejesus ... specimen cups ?
what about his suit ? that 's a million five the company 's got to replace . they 'll make somebody go get it .
the man is unbelievable ... i say , leave him in there .
who else ... sixpack .
it would n't make any difference in there ... he could be two feet away and on fire and she 'd still not see him !
if he had his blinkers on --
the weather 's good , i already checked , but i 'll be off in a minute .
hey , bo ... when 're you going to be off that thing ? i want to find out tonight 's nba scores and check the weather .
fuck the suits , it 's the people monitoring them . it doc had been there like he 's supposed to it never would 've happened !
i 'm telling you , it 's the suits !
take it off and let me have a look .
itches like hell .
still bothering you ?
what was it ?
it ... almost got you .
what happened ?
... and a russian grandmother ...
bullshit .
russian , french , italian , spanish , greek , german , a little hindu , some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili ... standard pre-med background ...
you read russian ?
russian .
what the ? ...
and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon ? ... no , thank you . i 'll take my chance down here .
i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here !
that < u > thing < /u > happens to be my friend .
i ai n't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself .
you let him get away !
it 's hazy ... it 's got him ! stay here and do n't let him out . i 'm going to get the doc .
what 's going on ?
fuck double pay , man ! i want out of here !
at least we get time and a half . that 's in the contract .
he did n't say it was a `` routine check-up , '' he said it was a `` routine < u > precaution < /u > . ''
`` routine , '' my ass ! ai n't nothin ' `` routine '' about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down ... especially when we 're getting picked up the next day !
pretty good . he sent them out videotaping outcrop .
yeah ? how 'd the kid hold up ?
what music ? there ai n't no music .
oooooh . damn ! not so loud . turn down the music .
shhhh ... do n't tell no one . job security .
so that 's all you do ? ...
ah , it 's just old , like me . you do n't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints ... i say , as long as it 's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it . but , 'long as we 're here ...
listen to it for christsake .
whooo ! right on , cobb ! let 's hear it for our shop steward !
no way , mister beck ! < u > no < /u > < u > fucking way < /u > ! we just did a full shift , you ca n't call shack duty on top of a full shift . it 's a contract violation !
i 'm going to kill it !
it 's sixpack !
i feel it , too ... someone 's trying to get out .
hey ! ... i feel something . it 's moving ! he 's alive !
i ai n't , goddamnit ... it 's jones ! ..
c'mon , cobb ... you 're slacking ...
he 's tanking on us ...
bad as he is there 's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there . you just ca n't do it .
i 'm on the way to the looney bin ? hey , man , i 'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes .
you 're on your way somewhere all right ... the looney bin .
what game , cobb ? ... i 'm on my way to nirvana ...
you guys are crazy . what the hell you play that stupid game for ?
this is what i wear at the beach , goddamnit .
hey , cobb ... man , why do n't you take off your shirt and pants , man ? you should do that wearing what you 're going to wear at the beach .
i do , man . that 's a beautiful place . when i get out of here i 'm going there . find a nice little snow covered chalet , warm little woman , crackling fire --
who cares ?
hey , man , you know that in switzerland -- and this country 's the size of east l.a. , okay ? -- they speak 54 different dialects ? fifty-four !
probably the plumbing . you gon na make me finish that puzzle by myself , or what ?
look . water .
under there ?
getting some food .
what ? that ? ... i 've done this one before . you hungry ? i 'm hungry .
how 'd you do that ?
'fucker could have gotten us all killed .
serves his ass right to get it . motherfucker brings that shit onboard . i hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish .
twelve hours !
typhoon ? !
oh , gag , man , how can you eat that stuff ? ...
burritos ... enchiladas ...
i do n't know . i 'm guessing .
fuck semantics , doc ! you saying its like part dejesus , part sixpack , part bowman ? !
... it has many traits of deep sea marine life ... regeneration , scales , gills , even a period of dormancy ... but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored , or where the communication wiring was , may imply that it has some other quality ...
no fuckin ' lie ...
the monster appears to be a genetic aberration ...
like a leech .
it would explain the suction- like appendages .
it 's had a meal .
bigger than dejesus ? how ?
i 've got cobbie downstairs watching the door .
i 'm going to try to remove it .
what are you going to do to him ?
we 've got to get him to the infirmary .
we 're simply concerned about her ... proximity to ...
yes sir , ai n't that where we usually go when we 're sick ?
the infirmary ? ...
excuse me , sir ... bowman 's sick . she 's downstairs in the infirmary .
two hundred meters .
how far away is she ?
i 'm not touching you !
answer them and quit kicking me !
it saw us !
jameson ? who are you trying to con ... ?
who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ?
tip top , willie ... tip top .
are you okay , jonesy ?
well , why have n't they answered our flares ?
how many times i got to tell you . i saw a ship .
are you sure you saw something ?
do n't fuckin ' worry , i ai n't .
do n't spend all day down there .
she 's wondering what 's happening . we 're losing air faster than i thought .
the shack ...
the air 's stopped .
what is it ?
the good doctor signed our death warrant .
what is it ?
oh man , that 's just great ...
cobb 's cut ... it was in him ! it got doc ...
fucking great ... you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us ?
it needs blood ?
dejesus ... it 's got him .
what 's wrong ?
i ought to smack your face !
what on earth 's the matter with you ?
sleeping . no sign of doc , though . i 'll check the control room . you look in the shower room ...
how is he ?
sixpack ...
who were you talking to ?
honey , the company do n't give a flying fuck about `` whys , '' they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month .
no ... he 's really sick . i heard him last night . the company will take that into consideration ...
`` debbie does dallas '' ... hell , it 's in russian . i ca n't read it ...
what is it ?
jameson ? who 're you trying to con ?
hey , jonesy , who 's the best power forward in the nba ... jameson ?
let 's hope it holds .
clear for pickup .
do n't worry , darlin , i 'm ...
hardly .
what 's wrong , did you miss me ?
sorry , darling ... just thought a little humor would loosen us all up ... you know ? ...
bitch ! look what you did !
right .
the latch is screwed up . or the hinge .
your pocket ?
my pocket . check my pocket , will ya , honey ?
well not exactly , no ; i got 'em sitting in the car , actually ; i thought we might sell them back to the greek , but i am having a bit of a problem getting hold of him .
well , talk .
i wanted to talk to you about that .
a traffic warden . look , what 's this ?
a what ?
i am not sure what 's more worrying , the job or your past .
is there something we should know about you , soap ?
seven hundred for the pair .
how much did you part with ?
well , it 's still a good idea .
a month ? so , my friend , what fucking good is that , if we need it in six . . . no , five days ?
probably no longer than four weeks .
so how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return ?
stop fucking around , tom , and think . what are we going to do ?
i 'll kill him !
he 's a stroppy sod but he 's got more balls than a golfer , only he does n't know it . ' * cut from completed film .
soap is called soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour . he is proud of his job , and even more proud that it 's legal .
jesus , tom , do they work ?
drachmas , i hope . i would feel safer with a chicken drumstick . they could do more harm than good .
yeah , but he has got to tell his dad he is about to lose his bar .
it 's hit us all hard !
at the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days ; it 's hit him hard .
i would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse . the odds are a hundred to one for a good reason , bacon . . . it wo n't win . so where is ed with all the bright ideas ?
the odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand .
sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in harry 's stone cold heart .
when the old bastard is not playing cards he 's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons .
and tom took care of them .
apart from those shotguns .
the traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear . they got no case against us because there is no evidence against us .
well what ?
well ?
think about what you 're going to say , ed ; we are on thin ice .
he 'll care all right . that was going to be his money . whether he cares about us is different . pass your phone .
that inspires confidence , that does .
scarface , i have watched scarface . you want to know how to do a drug deal , you watch scarface !
i dunno , but i do n't think we need him . dump him at the lights .
i think he 's still alive . he 's got claret coming out of him somewhere . what did they want with a traffic warden ?
let 's have a butcher 's . jesus , there 's lots of everything . we 've got god knows how much of this stinking weed ; we 've got a shit load of cash ; and we 've got a . . . traffic warden .
bacon , see what we got .
i 'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there .
of course you will , sweetheart . this one , search this one . ed finds the keys without any trouble .
it 's happening tomorrow morning . get back here now .
yes ?
they ca n't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked , can they ?
i do n't know how you 've reached that conclusion .
i 'll think of something , do n't worry .
let me tell you about hatchet harry . once there was this geezer called smithy robinson who worked for harry . it was rumoured that he was on the take . harry invited smithy round for an explanation . smithy did n't do a very good job . within a minute harry lost his temper and reached for the nearest thing at hand , which happened to be a fifteen-inch black rubber cock . he then proceeded to batter poor smithy to death with this ; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . hence , hatchet harry is a man you pay if you owe .
and nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to ; a bit anti-social , you know .
because it 's cheap like a budgie .
i still will , if you do n't mind .
twenty-five from me , tom , soap and yourself ; a hundred grand to the pound . you do n't need to count it .
the baptist got his name from drowning people for hatchet .
hatchet has a colleague , a monster of a man : barry the baptist .
the reason he is called bacon is he spent so much of his youth in the police station that people thought he was one of them . but he is a big boy now and it is time to move on .
ed can run fast , talk fast , eat fast , and play cards fast , but he 's fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz .
you ask him if you like , but i would leave him to it if i was you .
well whatever it is , could you get your man to turn the tv down ?
it 's a samoan pub .
i thought this was a pub .
you want a pint , go to the pub .
no , i asked you to give me a refreshing drink . i was n't expecting a fucking rainforest ; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that .
a cocktail , you asked for a cocktail .
what 's that ?
you heard of harry lonsdale ? otherwise known as back-you-up with-a- hatchet harry , infamous for his removal of digits ?
yeah , bazza , what ?
inside , out-fuckin'-side . i do n't give a shit , you get those guns because if you do n't . . .
we made a deal for everything inside the cabinet .
you fucking well have to get 'em !
i am not fucking interested .
they were . . .
well you just better un-sell 'em , sharpish .
not in the cabinet there was n't . there was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying ; they were ours , and we sold 'em !
there were two old guns there ; where are they ?
i do n't know what you mean .
now , stop fucking around . the others , the old ones ?
there are no others .
where 're the others ?
next time we do a job like this we gon na want more money , or we are going back to post offices and cars .
you should see what they did to poor gary .
you get the guns ?
i thought you said no staff , bazza !
if it looks old , it 's worth money , simple . so stop fucking moaning and rob the place .
antiques ? what the fuck do we know about antiques ? we rob post offices and steal cars , what the fuck do we know about antiques ?
like antiques .
like what ?
do n't play innocent with me bazza ; spanking !
er , very nice harry . what 's it for ?
good , you can get this under control now .
no mortgage , no debts ; lock , stock , the sodding lot . . . do n't worry , i got it under control .
and jd is his dad , and owns the whole property ?
where did he get a hundred grand ?
better than good , he is a fucking liability .
all right , all right , so we can say he is good .
fucking northern monkeys .
i hate these southern shites .
careful , remember who 's giving you this job .
i see , one of those `on a need to know ' basis things , like a james bond film , is it ?
you 're doing it for me is all you need to know . you only know that because you need to know .
so who 's the guv ? who we doing this for ?
it 's a fucking stately home , of course there 'll be something there .
oh , thanks very much . and there had better be something there for us .
oh , you must be the brains then . that 's right , guns that fire shot . . . make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet . there will be a load of guns , that 's all i want . i 'll pay you when you deliver . everything outside the cabinet you can keep ; it 's yours .
shotguns ? what , like guns that fire shot ?
well , i suggest you speak to him , then .
i have got something for ya . well , for your boy , actually .
yes ?
i think i can help you , as it happens .
can i help ?
nope .
chris . you come to collect something , chris ? should i have something for you ?
jd .
good job , chris .
it looks like t , but who knows ? the opportunity was there . in my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there .
they were going to pay , then ?
yeah , it 's all there , to the pound .
have you counted the money ?
er , yeah , sure , i 'll have 'em .
the boys had 'em . i know you like these things ; wondered if you wanted them ?
no harry , you ca n't .
it 's about time you give my young friends a visit , chris . tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word , and i ca n't have that now , can i , chris ?
i am sure you have , no one was accusing you of being dishonest , john .
i wo n't be seeing you again chris ; i have paid him every last penny .
hello , john . nice holiday ?
no chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there ?
son , have a look in his locker .
i 'll have it for mr harry in a few days . i have been busy , and i am nearly there .
did i say speak ? and it 's mr harry to you . . . now do n't disappoint me and chose your words carefully . you may speak .
jesus christ !
mind your language in front of my boy .
you had better be careful .
well , it 's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive .
what are you doing ?
all right , furry muff .
well , you had better go and get it from the office . that 's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday . now chop-fuckin'-chop .
it 's in an office ; i have just left it in the office . 137
very fucking funny . where 's what i want ?
you all right back there , mate ?
made a few quid , did ya ? now where is it ?
son ?
well , put your seatbelt on then .
all right , dad .
that should take care of that lot . we are now officially in the money- loaning business , all right , son ?
try that one .
it 's not him , dad .
let 's have a look , shall we ?
just carrying a bag .
is he on his own ?
about twenty minutes .
how long has he been in there , son ?
i am sure you do , but i do n't think you understand ; i am not going to see them or the guns again .
i got the money to pay for 'em .
not likely i am afraid ; i do n't think i 'll be seeing them again .
you know those shotguns i sold ya , well i need 'em back .
what can i do for you ?
sure is .
is that you , dean ?
that 's no way to answer the phone .
yeah ?
furry muff , let 's go .
listen , i do n't care who lives in there ; all as i know it 's got to be preferable to death by hatchet .
this is dangerous shit , dean ; we do n't even know who lives in there .
we got ta get those guns .
we 're in the spite . they were his fucking guns that we sold ; we got ta find 'em .
jesus , i have heard about him .
that was hatchet horrible harry .
who was that ?
it just cost me fifty quid to have this done . if you think i am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you 're mistaken , kenny .
ca n't you pull that stocking down further , kenny ?
all right , kenny .
ok gary , we call each other kenny , all right ?
but ... give it us here , you dozy sod . you hide and get the guns ready . wait until they are well in , then give it to 'em .
we 're not going next door until we 've flayed these dead men walking . count it out the back . i do n't want them seeing you fingering that money as soon as they walk in .
shit , dog , there 's a lot . do n't you want to do this next door ?
the stupid bastards ! count it !
dog , i have found the cash !
in fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem , is n't it ? you could say that in the scale of these things this is the mount fucking everest of problems , could n't you ? . . . and the reason it is such a mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you do n't have the first fucking idea who did this to us , do you ?
er well , yes we do .
so we have a bit of a problem , do n't we ?
it is too late for you to start thinking john . it is a possibility and that is good enough for me . and after you strip the house , i want you to get every thieving slag this side of ceylon and torture them , badly . i want to know who is responsible , otherwise i will hold you responsible .
what is the point in that ? even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em .
i want you to search the house for bugs . i mean i want you to strip it .
how about you ? all right ?
my neck , dog . that 's the last bag ?
ok , open the gate .
yeah , one of them 's out .
who are you going to kill plank ? there 's no one there .
do n't you stags move or i 'll kill the lot of ya .
just give me the keys .
it must be this one .
i did n't touch him , he just passed out .
what the fuck did you do to fauntleroy ?
just hold on , i got the keys .

and it better bloody not be . once he is firmly in place , he gets the rest of us in . we 'll get nasty with a couple of them , shit 'em up , scare and gag 'em . i ca n't see these wankers giving us a problem , but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy . when the job is done we 'll come straight back here . it 's dark by then , unload and robert 's your father 's brother . everybody savvy ?
no .
what 's that idiot doing next door ? we use your van . it 's up some stairs this place , so we 'll stick out like balls on a bulldog . plank is going up first . there is a cage but it is never locked , is it plank ?
there is no such thing as easy in my experience and , if you think this is going to be easy , you 're a dick . it may be easier than most but it 's not going to be easy .
there 's nothing to worry about , it 's going to be easy .
even if they could they 'd be too shit scared . they have got no muscle ; they 're gutless faggots .
is there no way they can get back to you ?
i must have been there fifty times , it 's never been locked ; they 're not suspicious . everybody who goes there are toffs . they 're all into that karma crap : `if i do n't harm nobody , nobody harms me ' stuff .
what do you mean , never ? well what have they got it for , then ?
there 's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it .
poofs . nothing heavy , four public school guys . soft as shite .
what they like then ?
well enough . i have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of years .
so do you know these geezers well ?
out the back .
and the weed ?
out the back .
where ?
plank ?
i mean it , there is only three of us here .
do you want me to take his leg off ? where 's the fourth ?
there is only three of us here .
and all your friends , there 's a good lad .
all right , all fucking right , i am coming . willie , he does n't know you are here , just sort something out , ok .
right , his leg 's going now .
get the sodding gate open now , plank .
j , what 's going on out there ? get the rifle out , charles . we 're being fucked .
what the fuck is going on ?
willy , this is the last time , and do n't let him know that you 're here , otherwise he will be here all day , and get rid of him quick . we have work to do .
hold on bollocks , no one but card players in here tonight sonny , and i do mean no one .
samoan jo 's ? yon mean the pub ? hold on . . .
all right , just you ; the others can wait in samoan jo 's next door .
well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the queen on it . will that do ?
yeah invitations , you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it .
invitations ?
invitations .
i mean it 's fucking empty .
what do you mean ?
there 's nothing in it !
tom , go and throw those guns off a bridge .
i do n't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid .
i do n't know , but what i do know is that there 's no more harry , which means there 's no more debt , and if there 's no more debt there 's no more problem , and there 's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead . i think , if i get this right , we have n't done anything wrong anyway , which means we are in the clear .
well , what 's going on ?
listen , if he has the guns he might have the money . . . i think we should go and see him .
you what ? what are you on about ?
it 's either that , my old boy 's place , and we lose a digit daily . i am going to call him .
i hope this is the right move .
there is nowhere else to keep it , and it 's the last place they are going to look . anyway the battle 's over and the war is won .
you think it 's a good idea taking it back to yours ?
that 's it all done , we are off .
if you think i am going to war without one , you 're mistaken , mate .
and look what happened to that .
why not ? the whole of the british empire was built on cups of tea .
no i fucking do n't ! you ca n't make a cup of tea , edward .
where did they get those outfits from ? have n't we got some like that , tom ?
where the fuck are they going ? to butcher a sheep ? i thought this was a robbery .
no , just one of them is in charge of them going to the job . so i assume he will still
carrying them . they could all be carrying them for what we know .
and we will just have to find out who 's going to be carrying them .
jesus , soap , stop being such a mincer . i thought about that and ...
guns ! you never said anything about guns . a minute ago this was the safest job in the world , now it 's turning in to a bad day in bosnia . . .
er , bad breath , colourful language and a feather duster ! . . . what do you think they will be armed with ? guns , you tit !
what was that , armed ? what do you mean , armed ? armed with what ?
hit the fuckers .
well , what do you want us to do about it ?
well that depends on how you look at it . i can afford it as long as i see it again , if that 's what you mean . you got the rest from the fat man and bacon ?
are you sure you can afford twenty-five ?
we paid seven hundred quid for those guns . they could hardly trace them to you , could they ?
the only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car which is sitting outside ?
i 'll only be a minute .
tom ?
i'11 meet you in the car .
tom , do n't mess around , let 's go .
this is our money , tom ! . . . now i think we should go .
. . . what ?
tom , this is our case .
what do you mean , me ?
you and me , tom .
he said he thinks we have paid him , and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now .
well , what did he say ?
where the hell are we supposed to hide ?
right as rain .
everything all right out there , tom ?
top of the list of priorities , how nice they look .
i dunno , but they look nice . i rather like ' em .
er , let me guess , my foot in your arse ? a game of cards and hatchet harry . you 're supposed to be getting some rest , boy !
why , what 's up ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
he means they 're thieving dogs .
what do you mean ?
the man who decides if you can play is this man harry , or hatchet harry as some including himself like to call him .
you see it 's not easy to take a seat at this table ; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters .
bacon , the fat man and myself , and it 's time to make a call to harry .
who 's this fat man , then ?
i bet you did . i have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me , which means that some poor sod does n't . you must have upset a few people , boy . . . but that is n't really my concern , is it ? but what does concern me is the guns you had . i want to talk to you about that . get your arse over here now , and i do mean now !
i wanted to talk to you about that .
it 's pay day , ai n't it ?
it 's ed , if that 's what you mean .
that you , boy ?
and still got a sense of humour . that 's not monkey nuts son ; you can still fold . ok , before i loan you this , i expect , if you lose of course , my money back within a week , crystal ? that 's sunday , ok ?
unless you are going to accept twenty quid .
for half a million ?
i 'll see ya .
well , you 're going to have a problem carrying on , aintcha .
that 's if i want to see you .
no , you need five hundred grand to see me .
i need two hundred and fifty grand .
i am not interested in what you would rather ; i want to keep going . i am also offering you the money , so we do n't have to turn them over because you can borrow .
i think i would rather just turn them over .
i will loan you the money .
you will what ?
i will .
yes . . . and is there something else you want to say ? eddy
that is quite a raise , one hundred and fifty on my hundred .
never mind son , you just might meet him if you carry on like that .
yup , you must be harry ? sorry , i did n't know your father .
you must be eddy . jd 's son .
a hundred grand .
you got it all ?
and you do have a reputation , so i 'll choose my words carefully . but not to put too fine a point on it , fuck yourself , harry !
what , and i care ? remember , you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son 's life .
harry , that boy does n't know his arsehole from his ear-hole , or you from a hoodwink . this bar is mine , and he has nothing to do with it .
do you want me to draw a picture ?
and ?
i want your bar .
yes ?
i like your bar .
go on .
what do you think i am doing ? hold on . what are you doing ? unlock that gate . oi ! i said unlock that fucking gate .
what are you doing , plank ?
i know . now shut it . you say a fucking word the right knee goes , another word then your left .
sorry , got to do business like this now ; ca n't be too careful these days .
lives and learns does n't one .
i did n't know you were a kebab man , plank .
i thought you were going to leave me out there all day .
hold on . ok. look willie , it 's plank outside asking for you , he says it 's in our interest .
i think you 'll find it is in your interest .
i ca n't help you , plank .
look , could you just open the door so i could talk without shouting ?
well , perhaps i ca n't , plank , if you know what i mean .
well , perhaps you can help ?
no , i 'm afraid he 's not . he 's out at the moment .
all right , it 's plank . is willie there ?
hello , can i help you ?
rory breaker is standing by . you stand to make a lot of money , tommy boy .
all right , let 's forget about them for the time being . what about your weed man ?
of course you will look mean , tom , you will look really scary .
range ? i do n't want to blow the arse out of this country , granted , but i do n't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either . i want to look fucking mean .
sawn-offs are out , tom ; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays .
seven hundred each .
they look nice , i agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility , are n't they ? i might get laughed at . how much do you want for these muskets ?
i got contacts . listen tom , if you pointed them at me i 'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do . either way you still get the desired effect .
jesus , if i pick them up , will they stay in one piece ? where did you get them from ?
i think you 're nick the greek .
bloody hell , tom ! this is a bit heavy . this is london , not the lebanon ' who do you think i am ?
never mind that now . i also need some artillery , you know , a couple of sawn-off shotguns .
jews do n't celebrate christmas , tom .
neither me , but it depends on what flicks your switch , and the light 's on and burning bright for the masses .
does n't sound very good to me .
not normal weed . this is some fucked-up skunk class a. i ca n't think let alone move shit .
you know it does n't include the amp .
and that does include the amp ?
you know how much it is , nick .
how much did you say it was , tom ?
of course you are . all right , ed .
what are you talking about ? i am bloody skinny , pal .
so i 've just got to put you in , and i am off .
so ?
my van is half full .
at what , exactly ?
look . go on , look .
you 've already been fifteen .
i 'll only be a minute .
you got a ticket already and , if you do n't move it now , sir , we will move it for you .
ok , do n't panic ; let 's think about this .
that 's fucked it . what do we do now ? no money , no weed ; it 's all been swapped for a pile of corpses .
the money , the gear !
how come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy ? ]
how the fuck should i know ?
that 's right . so how many whiskers has the little white kitten got ?
er , well , twelve .
how many feet ?
twelve .
how many wings have they got between them ?
six .
there 's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road . how many beaks have they got between them ?
tom , the fatter you get , the sadder you get .
you would take a pain n the arse full stop .
i would take a pain in the arse for half a million .
this guy rory breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are selling . it 's not worth him giving us trouble ; he knows we would be a pain in the arse , and who wants a pain in the arse ?
what about all the gear ?
hold on , give us half a chance to count it .
what 's left over ? '
when the bottle in my arse has contracted i 'll let you know .
well jesus , that was n't so bad , was it ?
nick the greek .
where did you get those from , a museum ?
well , excuse me , brother , mother or any other sucker , does n't make any difference , they are still fucking guns , and they still fire fucking bullets !
it 's the mother of fuck-ups , stupid !
oh , you assume , do ya ? what do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups ?
listen cooky , you want to make sure that man rests before he plays ; it 's in all our interests .
tom , you 're all heart .
what you telling us for ? the only thing i care about is whether you get your rest in .
you 're not funny tom ; you 're fat and look as though you should be funny , but you 're not .
whatever it 's going on , it 's still enough to send you on a cooking course .
that 's going on optimism .
so , a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty , for twenty-five grand invested . that 's going on previous experiences .
get your fingers out of my soup !
if you will order stuff that comes from kat-man-fucking-du do n't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route . ~ never mind that , what about the money ?
cupid stupid ! that 's the last time i am getting any more fruit off you tom . call that fresh ? there was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit . you should open a butcher 's , not a grocer 's .
what have you come as ?
i mean we grow copious amounts of ganja , and you do n't look like your average hort-er-fucking-culturalist , that 's what i mean , willy .
what do you mean ?
we also need a fucking money counter , william ! we have to get the money out by thursday and i 'll be buggered if i am counting it . . . and if you have to get your sodding fertilizer , could n't you be a little more subtle ?
we need fertilizer , winston .
you went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back carrying two bags of fertilizer . alarm bells are ringing , willy .
er , fertilizer .
what are you carrying , willy ?
the problem is , willy , that charlie and yourself are not the quickest of cats in the alley at the best of times , so just do as i say and keep the fucking cage locked .
chill , winston , it 's me and charlie can see it 's me , so what 's the problem ?
it 's pathetic . you ca n't be desperately in love when you 're 14 years old .
so ?
joanie orozco 's telling the whole school she 's like desperately in love with santo guerra .
just shut up .
and those stupid girls who hang out with them --
i do n't pretend i came over on the mayflower --
who 'd want to be friends with that bunch of pachuco wannabes ?
i 'm not talking to you . you do n't have any friends .
you jerk --
catholic school , nasty .
two years at hard labor , our lady of perpetual help .
and what did she do ?
i said pretty much the same thing to my mother when i was your age .
it 's my life . if i want to fuck it up , that 's my business .
if you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was , i would be happy ! i would be thrilled .
oh , come on -- you and grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant . when dad --
that is n't true .
i 'm not settling for anything . i like cars , it 's just not a move up the ladder to you , so you think it 's a waste .
i think you can learn whatever you want to . i just do n't see you doing it . if you want to settle for --
you think i ca n't learn that ?
you can fix old cars . mr. washburn told me that the cars they 're making now are all computerized --
i can fix cars .
how do you think you 're going to make a living ?
save your breath . that line does n't cut it with me .
they stole our land --
that makes it okay ?
just some rich anglo out on the lake . do n't even live here all year .
do n't try to con me , amado . you knew how they got all those things .
they 're not going to jail .
so i 'm worried about you . i do n't want you to end up in jail like your friends .
so ?
-- you 're going to be on your own .
i ca n't take any more school .
i 'm only going to have you for two more years . if you decide not to go on to college --
you and all of the teachers in this dump -- your story 's over , so you do n't want anybody else to have fun .
leave your sister out of it .
just 'cause i 'm not like little miss honor roll here --
oh , come on , amado --
if you had your way i would n't have any friends .
you 'll find out when i get you home . thanks , sam .
i do n't know what the big deal is .
thank you , sir .
you 're dismissed , private .
yes , sir .
why do n't you start with that ?
no , sir . they all been real straight with me .
any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers ?
no , sir . not at all .
do you think you 've been discriminated against on this post ?
they got people to fight . arabs , yellow people , whatever . might as well use us .
why do you think they let us in on the `` deal '' ?
chaos .
outside it 's -- it 's such a mess -- it 's --
because it 's a job ?
i do , sir .
with your attitude , private , i 'm surprised you want to stay in the service .
i mean , follow orders , sir .
do whatever they tell you --
work hard , be good at your job . sir . do whatever they tell you .
how do you think i got to be a colonel ?
it 's their country . this is one of the best deals they offer .
please .
you really want to know , sir ?
well ?
and that 's the job ? nothing about serving your country ?
the -- the officers .
who 's `` they '' ?
follow orders . do whatever they say .
what exactly do you think your job is , private ?
i am , sir .
you do n't sound too enthusiastic .
i-i can do the job , sir .
do you believe in what we 're doing here , private johnson ?
yes , sir --
when you were given the opportunity to enlist , a kind of contract was agreed upon . i think the army has honored its part of that agreement .
i 'm sorry , sir .
then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested , you 're the only one who came up positive for drugs ?
no , sir --
private johnson , are you unhappy in the army ?
thank you , sergeant major .
you 're dismissed .
thank you , sergeant major .
if the incident happened the way you say it did , there has n't been an infraction .
will this go on my record ?
he 's going to lose a lung . this is not good news for athena --
out of the army ?
he 'll live .
sergeant major ? how is richie doing ? private graves ?
i 'm sorry , sergeant major . there was n't anything i could do . shadow gets crazy --
it 's not our job to get involved in your personal life , but when it interferes with the training here --
from back in houston . we both come up on fifth street .
so you knew this young man before ?
yes , sergeant .
you and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals . put it in gear .
you 're testing me ?
i 'm very happy to hear that , private . now you go put some pee-pee in a cup for dr. innis and i 'll be feeling okay , too .
i 'm feeling okay --
report to dr. innis at the clinic .
sergeant ?
private johnson !
i know that , sergeant . we were just dancing . there was a bunch of us there . shadow just come down looking for trouble .
we 're not running a dating service here .
we were just dancing --
and you and private graves --
if i had i would n't have gone in .
did you know he was going to be there last night ?
yeah , it 's a pretty cold trail .
what i will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end . you know how the press is with a murder story -- even if it 's forty years old .
you got to investigate . no question about it .
if it was some poor mojado , swam across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would n't go any further . but this is a formerly prominent citizen .
so is buddy on your short list ?
just wondering .
he swore by it . what ?
a .45 --
colt peacemaker .
you uhm -- you remember what old buddy carried for a side arm ?
so he could have gone out to the base , hopped the fence , dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack .
skull was intact , no soft tissue left -- not much to go on .
you got a cause of death ?
everybody on the border knows that story .
you know the popular version of how he left town .
yeah .
-- it did n't come out of a cereal box .
that badge --
charley wade .
male , 40 to 50 years old , five-foot- eleven , chewed tobacco -- then we get into the dental records --
nice job .
we find a body , it 's either skinny or stinky , depending on how much meat there is on the bones .
skinny ?
yeah , this is skinny .
that the word on our boy ?
yeah , we 'll have folks swimming over to mexico to work in the sweatshops .
gon na pull a lot of jobs out of this county .
september '97 , that 's all she wrote .
i hear they 're closing that post down .
business is booming . got your drugs , got your illegals -- had a shooting the other night at big o 's -- soldier got ventilated .
how 's business ?
hey , ben . thanks for coming down .
sam the man .
now or later , charley . you wo n't have any trouble finding me .
you little pissant --
there 's not a soul in this county is n't sick to death of your bullshit , charley . you made yourself scarce , you could make a lot of people happy .
you 're fired . you 're outta the department .
whole different story ; is n't it ?
who said anything about shootin ' anybody ?
you ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye ?
you do whatever i say you do or else you put it on the trail , son .
i 'm not picking it up .
you feeling bad for jimmy ? have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side . those old boys in ciudad leon --
that 's not the point .
there 's gon na be some left over for you , buddy . i take care of my boys .
it 's your deal . you sweated it out of him , you pick it up .
i roust some muchacho on the street , does n't have his papers , all he got to say is `` yo trabajo para jimmy herrera . ''
so ?
jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks , most of 'em relatives . people breed like chickens .
what 's that for ?
thanks . i like it when you say that , sam .
you look good , bunny . it 's nice to see you .
`` i only got my little girl now , '' he says , `` she 's my lifeline . '' then he tells me i ca n't be in the box anymore if i ca n't control myself . sonofabitch do n't even watch the damn game , just sits there drinking with his bidness friends , look up at the tv now and then . i do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people .
i think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest . a spotter .
this boy from west side , plays tackle both ways . bench-presses 350 pounds . you imagine having that much weight on top of you ? pushing down ? be hard to breathe . hard to swallow .
what ?
350 pounds .
no , it was n't , was it ? you did n't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul , did you ?
it was n't just you , bunny .
you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke , did n't you , sam ? all that time we were first seeing each other you did n't know i was tightly wound --
suppose not .
you watch the draft this year ? 'course you did n't , idiot question . they try to make it dramatic , like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . doctor 's reports , highlight reels , coaches ' evaluations , psychological profiles -- hell , i would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys , have 'em analyzed . all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . compared to that , what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly , does it ?
you did n't -- uhm -- you did n't have one of your fires , did you ? the stuff i left in the garage -- some of it was my father 's --
yeah . sort of . daddy rounds 'em up . you are n't talking about money , their beady little eyes go dead .
no . you ?
least he never called me that . with me , it was always `` high-strung . '' `` my bunny might have done something with her life , she was n't so high-strung . '' or `` tightly wound , '' that was another one . you seeing anyone ?
bunny , is that stuff i left in the garage still there ?
daddy hired a pinhead to take your job . he says so himself . says `` even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead i got now '' .
best part of the job .
you look awful good in that uniform , though .
same weight i always was .
daddy calls it an `` altercation . '' how you doing , sam ? you look skinny .
you were in a fight --
-- they had n't pulled me off that woman i would have jerked a knot in her .
yeah , well --
-- and that squeaker the aggies dropped to oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal --
you look good --
last year was awful rough -- mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. -- i mean it 's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop --
no , you look good . i was just wondering .
do i seem jumpy ?
bunny , you -- uhm -- you on that same medication ?
well , daddy 's got his box at the stadium , of course , and i 'll fly to the cowboy away games when they 're in the conference . then there 's the high school on friday ' nights . west side got a boy 6'6 '' , 310 , moves like a cat . high school , we 're talkin ' . guess how much he can bench-press ?
you still going to all the home games ?
rio . bunny right . this kid , hosea brown ? does tire 40 in 3.4 , soft hands , lateral movement -- the whole package . only a sophomore --
oh . right . and you 're in -- ?
that 's in maverick county .
the longhorns gon na kick some serious butt this saturday , you just watch . we got a kid at tailback from down your way -- outta el indio --
he never asked her .
my mother said he never asked about --
otis went on like you were that guy who won the gulf war . colin whatsit .
it 's a small post and they 're phasing it out in two years , but i moved up in rank and -- well , a command is a command .
yeah , i know -- man made me memorize the whole damn army chain of command before he 'd marry me . so this is a big deal , commander and all ?
i 'm a colonel .
otis stood on good terms with the man . whenever you do something makes the news , he sends it on . when they made you general , otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it .
uncle al --
your mother got a brother -- alphonse --
where 'd he get all this ?
there was a bunch of 'em you never met . me neither .
i never met her .
i been here with him eight years now . he built it when he was with leora .
you 've been in this house for a while ?
come on in .
if it 's too late --
come on in --
colonel . is uhm -- is otis in ?
hey , it 's the general .
so that 's him --
you 'll get official notification when i make my decision . he is out the door -- otis pulls himself a beer as carolyn steps back out --
well , he 's living proof of that , son . living proof .
my father says the day you 're born you start from scratch , no breaks and no excuses , and you got to pull yourself up on your own .
by blood you are . but blood only means what you let it .
so i 'm part-indian ?
these are our people . there were paynes in florida , oklahoma , piedras negras -- couple of 'em won the whatsit -- congressional medal of honor --
so how come you got into all this ?
when you 're his age you 'll still be pissed off about him .
he 's still pissed off about it .
did n't have a father ?
i mean , just 'cause he did n't -- you know --
well --
public display of affection . every time he moves up a rank , it 's like he 's got to tighten the screws a little more --
pda ?
no sports if i do n't keep a b average , no tv on school nights , no pda 's --
he 's a pretty tough old man , huh ?
are you kidding ? and face a court- martial ?
you did n't go telling your father you were here ?
that guy who got shot --
i got a pretty good guess .
you know who i am ?
they were in the army . like your father .
but they were indians themselves .
same as they done in mexico .
they fought against the indians ?
men worked for santa anna down there , waited out the civil war . the land was n't much to feed people on , so in 1870 they come north and put up at fort duncan and the men joined up what was called the seminole negro indian scouts . best trackers either side of the border . bandits , rustlers , texas rednecks , kiowa , comanche --
they got tired of fighting , went to the indian territories for a while . but the slave-raiders were on 'em even there , and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to mexico . crossed at eagle pass .
so they stayed in florida ?
they teaching that now ? good . only a couple of 'em held out -- this man , john horse , and his friend wild cat , and a fella name of osceola . army put all of them in prison and osceola died , but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten , fifteen years . beat zach taylor and a thousand troops at lake okeechobee .
the trail of tears .
he was part of the seminole nation , got pushed down into the everglades in pioneer days . african people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them , married up , had children . when the spanish give up florida , the u.s.army come down to move all them indian peoples off to oklahoma --
both .
he a black man or an indian ?
spanish in florida called him juan caballo . john horse .
go out through the back .
no sir .
you were n't in here tonight , were you ?
cool .
maybe we 'll clean that thing out back up , have a barbecue next weekend . we could invite him and his wife over .
he does .
yeah . he lives here , right ?
my father .
are we going to ever see your father ?
good .
fine . i 'm pretty much moved in .
how 's your room shaping up ?
no .
you would n't ?
not that i do n't think you 'd be good at it , but -- you know -- i would n't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life .
so you 're going into the army ?
you got to be in the army , you might as well have something slick to drive .
tanks , huh ?
i finished that . i 'm just messing around .
homework ?
how many b-average students do you think they take at west point ?
i have a b average .
i thought we already had this out ? next year , if your grades are high enough --
dad , i talked to the track coach --
dad , can i talk to you about track ?
big o was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink .
`` hey , delmore , where 's your daddy ? ''
dad -- ?
dad --
otis payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life .
my government can go fuck itself , and so can yours . i 'm talking about people here -- men . mi amigo eladio cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day --
your government always been pretty happy to have that line . the question 's just been where to draw it
bird flying south-you think he sees that line ? rattlesnake , javelina -- whatever you got -- halfway across that line they do n't start thinking different . so why should a man ?
you ever know a fella named eladio cruz ?
something like that .
made some money , came back here --
fifteen years in el paso .
you lived in the states for a while ?
this place , the one across the street , four other ones around ciudad leon -- soy el rey de las llantas . king of the tires . lots of your people rollin ' back over that bridge on my rubber .
you own this place ?
recycling , right ? we invented that . the government does n't have to tell people to do it .
what 's it doing on a rifle range ?
they were using m-1 's , yeah --
this is the stuff we picked up the other day , right ? the rest of this is all .30 caliber --
yeah ?
it 's a .45 .
what -- it 's a bullet . i 'm lousy with bullets here .
mikey look at this --
if i stayed out past ten with the guys she 'd go into her madame butterfly routine --
mikey --
her parents acted like i was gon na blow my nose on their curtains --
mikey --
i knew she was japanese going into it , but she did n't tell me the ninja assassin part --
hey , mikey --
always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice . but marriage , man -- i did two tours in southeast asia and i was married for five years -- i could n't tell you which experience was worse .
priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who is n't married must be a lesbian . she figures they 'll be so relieved i 'm a man --
you met her family ? they gon na be cool about you being a white guy ?
maybe .
you going to get married ?
i think it 's beyond what you 'd call dating .
never thought i 'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder .
you get the feeling he does n't want to be here ?
guy cracks walnuts with his asshole .
we had a kid pass out in the men 's room . the town is n't much .
since i 've been stationed here ? a fistfight now and then --
he ca n't hear with that rig on -- mikey !
the sheriff says we should n't touch anything ,
cliff --
you live in a place , you should know something about it . explore --
cliff --
man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer , he ca n't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear .
looks like a lot of cactus to me .
it 's not just cactus . there 's the nopals , the yuccas --
you finding lots of cactus and shit ?
i do n't know why i 'm talking to you , you 've got that thing on your head .
right .
it 's a lead mine .
what ?
lead mine .
this place is a gold mine .
you know who it was they dug up ?
they stopped training infantry there in the late '50s . it was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year .
man 's gon na retire in two years and he offer to quit . big goddamn deal .
i 'd quit the army for you , if it came to that .
it 's up or out these days , cliff . say i get transferred to a different post --
you could take it --
and if i get a shot at a promotion somewhere --
we should just do it .
we been through this before --
seriously , i think we should get married .
seriously .
well -- i do n't see what 's changed . no - pda 's , no necking on the obstacle course .
so where does that put us ?
she 's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood .
but i 'm the one in charge of her sorry ass .
hey -- she 's in a tough situation . i cut her some slack --
you spoil 'em , cliff .
he 'll probably be getting a medical discharge --
he 'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he 's stabilized --
sheriff deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday .
pleased to meet you .
sheriff -- hi -- this is sergeant -- this is priscilla worth .
old bullets . he uhm -- makes art with them .
treasure hunter ?
masons been around a long while .
that ring --
i 've got the forensics fella coming down from the rangers . no way to know how old the body is without some lab work .
this was a rifle range way back when . but we figured it is n't army land anymore , it 's your jurisdiction .
i was driving back from apache wells when they got me on the radio .
old sam stood for somethin ' , you know ? the day that man died they broke the goddamn mold .
yeah . i bet he would .
-- but just as a kind of safety tip .
-- warning . not 'cause he had it in for the colored
take that pair over in the corner --
you mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors , you be out of a job .
you joke about it , sam , but we are in a state of crisis . the lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy -- to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong , between this one and that one -- your daddy understood that . he was like the whatchacallit -- the referee for this damn menudo we got down here . he understood how most people do n't want their sugar and salt in the same jar .
good deal you were born down here , then .
-- but i got ta say i think there 's something to this cold climate business . i mean , you go to the beach- what do you do ? drink a few beers , wait for a fish to flop up on the sand . ca n't build no civilization that way . you got a hard winter coming , though , you got to plan ahead , and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout .
if the next guy 's a redneck .
now i 'm just as liberal as the next guy --
appreciate it , sir .
i sprint the last quarter mile . you gentlemen do n't have to keep up if you do n't care to .
i meant on the post . in general . how are you dealing with it ?
well , yeah , but i went through the program . i have n't had a drink since --
substance abuse ?
you know how it is , colonel -- first time away from home , dealing with new people -- i remember my first hitch --
have we had trouble there before ?
there 's not that much down here , colonel . big o 's is the only place in the county that our african american soldiers are uhm -- that they feel comfortable in .
because i 'm your father .
why would you want to do that ?
i gon na meet that family of yours ?
a lot of 'em choose both . there 's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people -- you 're not either on one side or the other --
and people make their choice --
over the years , this is the one place that 's always been there . i loan a little money out , settle some arguments . got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night . there 's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the mexicans hire each other . there 's the holiness church and there 's big o 's place .
i hear things , too . people call you the mayor of darktown .
right .
the army hands you a command , you go wherever it is .
i been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now . boys say they heard he 's a real hard case . spit-and-polish man . full- bird colonel name of payne , they say -- bet you never figured you end up back here .
that 's right .
well , you 're the man out there now , are n't you ? it 's your call .
we have an enlisted man 's club at the post .
your boys out there cooped up together , need somewhere they can let the steam out . if they 're black , there 's not but one place in this town they feel welcome . been that way since before you were born .
i assume a lot of your business is from our people .
this is an official visit , then --
so tell me why i should n't make this place off-limits .
so .
nice to meet you , ma'am .
this here 's carolyn . honey , this is my son , delmore .
if i thought it would help i 'd put up a sign telling them not to . right under the one about the employees washing their hands .
deal drugs in the bathroom --
it 's a bar . people come together , drink , fall in love , fall out of love , air their grudges out --
you get much of that in here ?
that 's where he fell .
that where he was shot ?
hobby of mine . got some artifacts , couple pieces one of your men out at the base made . free admission .
black seminoles ?
just a shotgun , huh ? better let me take a look at that .
si -- tengo escopeto -- just a shotgun --
you carryin ' a firearm , son ? do n't lie to me now .
protection ?
there 's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch . hope you 're carrying some protection .
bandidos , injuns --
reputation ?
you know this road got a bad reputation , eladio --
eladio cruz .
this same person been bragging all over the county how he do n't have to cut that big gringo sheriff in on it -- he can run his own operation 'thout any help . como se llama , amigo ?
i have n't seen anybody doing that .
i heard somebody been haulin ' wets on this road .

vi a rosaria arastrado para el corriente -- [ i saw rosaria taken away by the current -- ]
aqui ! venga por aqui ! [ over here ! come this way ! ]
no puedo ver la orilla ! [ i ca n't see the bank ! ]
aqui ! [ here ! ]
donde esta ? estoy perdido -- [ where are you ? i 'm lost -- ]
do n't worry about it . he owes me some favors .
senora , anything it costs , i can work --
a casa de porfirio zayas . he used to be a doctor on the other side . gunshot wounds , fixing babies -- if you can pay he can handle it .
donde vamos ? [ where are we going ? ]
rapidamente ! everybody in the world is going to see !
tipico .
we have a daughter .
this girl has a child ?
i am marry to the cousin of a friend -- but only to be able to live here . this is the mother of my child --
i thought you were married !
es mi novia . [ she 's my girlfriend . ]
this girl is a friend of yours ?
no es la verdad -- [ that is n't true -- ]
you think you 're doing these people a favor ? what are they going to do ? either they get on welfare or they become criminals --
no ! no puede hacer esto -- [ you ca n't do that -- ]
they need help . jaime , anselma -- esta es mi jefa --
enrique ! quienes son estos ? how could you bring them here ?
we was crossin ' the river --
do n't tell me lies , enrique . que paso ?
we was by the river ? and i hear my friend callin ' for help , and i look and she has falling in the water --

senora cruz ?
buenas noches , senora cruz . enrique walks in the opposite direction --
good night , enrique . she slides into the car --
is very beautiful , your car .
en ingles enrique . this is the united states . we speak english .
es muy lindo , su coche --
-- but buddy deeds was my salvation .
your mother was a saint .
we made our collection at roderick 's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him . he went missing the next day , along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail .
charley wade were known to have put a good number of people in the ground , and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball with him .
that buddy was a cool breeze .
`` mas cerveza por favor . ''
and the sheriff at the time was big charley wade . charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of sheriffs , he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county .
'57 , 1 believe --
the two of us were the only deputies back then me and buddy -- it 's what -- '58 --
hell , everybody heard that story a million times .
tell that one , hollis --
that 's not the whole story . the mexicans that know , that remember , understand what buddy was for their people . hell , it was mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him .
they just wanted it to be one of theirs --
bad enough all the street names are in spanish --
king was n't mexican , fenton --
every other damn thing in the country is called after martin luther king , they ca n't let our side have one measly park ?
better late than never . korean war hero , sheriff for near thirty years -- buddy deeds memorial p --
big day coming up -- i wish we 'd have thought of it while he was still living . but he went so unexpected .
he was a unique individual .
sam ! i was just telling a few about your old man .
he known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up . `` old fishbait , '' he says , `` never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it . ''
buddy deeds . he had a way .
`` fishbait , '' says buddy , in that quiet way of his , `` what you know about them tires that went missing from markets ? '' fishbait thinks for a minute , then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it , `` c'mon out , pooter , they caught us ! ''
when you backed me you needed somebody named deeds to bump the other fella out of office . hey , folks --
when we backed you --
we need a drug rehab program , we need a new elementary school --
dammit , sam , the people are concerned about crime --
we 're already renting cells to the feds for their overflow --
that 's a matter of interpretation --
we do n't need a new jail .
which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail -- just so we 're all on the same page .
rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue --
that kind of talk does n't help , sam .
jorge and his chamber of commerce boys got to keep things hummin ' --
seems like we have another one every week .
historic occasion , is n't it ?
word gets out who that body was , people are gon na think buddy done it .
do n't think the rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have .
widow 's benefits . he figured it would make the disappearance look better , and that mexican gal was just scrapin ' by after charley killed her man . they did n't get hooked up till late --
and the ten thousand ?
the three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under . ca n't say i was much help .
buddy deeds was a murderer .
buddy deeds --
yeah , and my mother was a saint . for fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side . stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business . but hell , what 's that ? you got a problem ? buddy 'll fix it . facing some time in jail ? buddy 'll knock half of it off -- if you do what he says , when he says . you got some business that 's not exactly legal ? talk to buddy --
your father had the finest sense of justice of any man i ever met --
imonna find out one way or the other .
open late .
hey , sam .
fellas .
i got to go see somebody in san antonio today . your memory gets any better , i 'll be back tonight .
you lived in the man 's house what -- seventeen , eighteen years ? and you did n't get to know him any better than that ?
i think somewhere between roderick bledsoe 's club and his house , wade ran into buddy deeds . i think buddy put a bullet in him , waited for him to die , threw him in the trunk of the sheriff 's car and drove him out by the army post , i think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back .
do you ?
i got an idea what happened .
i wish i could tell you i remembered something new , but i ca n't .
charley wade .
we have a murder ?
you thought any more about our murder ?
sam ! quite a do the other day . it meant a lot to folks that you said something .
morning , hollis .
and i understand why you might want to think he could .
people have worked this whole big thing up around my father . if it 's built on a crime , they deserve to know . now i understand why you might want to believe he could n't do it .
we got that dedication tomorrow . this is a hell of a time to be draggin ' up old business .
and buddy was one of them .
there 's no call for that , sam . fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years .
besides my father , i mean .
forensics people are sure of it . you have any idea who might have put him there ?
no . i think his widow 's still in their place in darktown , though . you think it 's charley wade , huh ?
he still living ?
he owned the colored roadhouse before big o --
bledso
i told the story enough times -- hell , we were just in the car , he was stewing about the fight with buddy while we drove over to roderick bledsoe 's --
you do n't remember anything else from that last night you saw him , do you ?
all it was wearing was a big old masonic ring and a rio county sheriffs badge .
charley ? i believe he was . used to go for lodge meetings over to laredo . what 's he got to do with your body ?
you recall if charley wade was a mason ?
was it davy crockett or jim bowie ?
we found a body out by the army base yesterday . been there for a long time .
just as well . the new people just painted it some god-awful color --
no .
you go by your old house ?
i have n't been out here for a while .
sounds great . where do i sign up ?
floating around out here , playin ' hell with them bass -- play a little cards , play a little golf , drink some beer --
sam ! hey podner ! you caught me playing hooky --
i always wondered what you mayors do when you 're not cutting ribbons .
look , i know you had some problems with your father , and he and muriel -- well --
right .
oh -- he come to an accommodation . money does n't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning .
not a peep . buddy run the man out of town .
never heard from him again ?
she put it even at three to three , so as the mayor i get to cast the tiebreaker . the older generation wo n't have any problem with it . they remember how buddy come to be sheriff , that it was all 'cause he took their part .
that so ?
right . but nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news --
-- santiago .
there was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the gulf war -- ruben --
oh , you know , the usual troublemakers . danny padilla from the sentinel , that crowd .
i heard there was a bit of a fuss .
look , i 'm not gon na campaign against your deal here , but if anybody asks me , i got to tell them the truth . we -- do n't -- need -- a new jail .
there is n't money allocated for that . but a jail --
it would n't happen to be your construction company gon na get the bid on building this thing , would it , h.l . and jorge , you would n't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters --
there was a mandate in the last election --
danny 's gon na be out for blood the next time .
he agreed it was n't exactly news --
the perdido thing ?
i got eddie richter at the sentinel to kill that story .
you ought to put up a banner -- `` frontera , texas : gateway to cut- rate pussy '' --
sam --
people come here to catch bass and to get laid at the boy 's town in cuidad leon --
we 're building up tourism , sam --
you told me one time it was true love .
i 'm unmarried . i 'm not available .
the old-high-school-heartthrob sheriff . i thought you were crazy about each other . he 's available , you 're available --
the sheriff .
how 'bout the sheriff ?
all my mother does is work . that 's how you get to be spanish .
you got to be interested in somebody . all you do is work .
sure , they go back to cortez . when he rode by , they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner .
your mother 's family is spanish ?
spanish , please . my mother would have a heart attack .
steve . board of education steve who likes you ? he goes for us hot-blooded mexican girls , i can tell .
steve ?
steve called for you .
`` that boy '' -- mami , say his name for chrissakes !
i never said that . it was just that boy --
what ? become a nun ? you did n't want me going out with anglos --
i felt that you could do better for yourself --
you made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody .
i never said that .
mami , the first time i brought him home , those were your exact words -- `` some chulo with grease under his nails . ''
i do n't mean fernando .
thank you .
maybe now . it was different back then . i had this place , i was doing all the shopping , all the cooking . what do i need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit ?
nobody 's too busy .
i was too busy .
there must have been somebody .
how come you never got married again ?
a little older than paloma is now .
right . when he was killed .
he was killed .
mami , how old were you when my father --
you want to see mexicans , open your eyes and look around you . we 're up to our ears in them .
oh , come on -- you must be curious how it 's changed . amado is into this big tejano roots thing and i 've never been further than ciudad leon --
why would i want to go there ?
no . i was wondering if you 'd like to take a trip down south with us . maybe see where you grew up --
did you come here to tell me how to run my business ?
if you spent a little more time training them --
nobody is illegal in my cafe ! they 've got green cards , they 've got relatives who were born here -- if they only had a little common sense i 'd be very happy .
well , you hire illegals --
if they 're going to survive here , they have to know how to work , elalco ! adelante ! los clientes esperan !
maybe you 're just getting less patient .
these ones coming up are getting stupider every year .
do you remember the last time you saw him ?
not if they was colored or meskin . not if they wanted to keep breathin ' .
people did n't complain ?
sheriff buddy was a different story . long as roderick throw his weight the right way on election day , make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then , if you was polite -- maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then , things was peaceful . that sheriff wade , though , he took an awful big bite .
and my father ?
was n't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club , see . roderick used to say , `` buy yourself a drink , you get a free membership . '' but sheriff wade , he could shut you down anytime .
he squeezed money out of you ?
them days , you deal with sheriff wade or you did n't deal at all . first of the month , every month , he remind you of who you really workin ' for .
you had to deal with him in running the club .
not if i can help it .
so you must remember sheriff wade .
we run that twenty-odd years . give it over to otis payne in 1967. april .
he had the club out on the old trail road --
i wo n't say nothing bad about the man , but you can ask away .
you mind if i ask a few questions about your husband ? roderick ?
well , do n't ever start up on 'em , cause once you do you ca n't stop . i tell myself i 'm gon na play just three little games after breakfast , and here i sit with half the day gone .
i 've seen 'em .
you ever play one of these ?
yeah , that 's the story of my life .
sheriff deeds ' dead , honey -- you just sheriff junior .
i 'm sheriff deeds --
that 's me .
mrs. bledsoe ?
i have new respect for some of my kids , meeting the parents they 've been dealt --
i 'd like to see them spend a day pulling 14-year-olds off of each other -- i should get combat pay --
i do n't think you can take it personally --
he 's going to wish he was dead .
no . is he sick ?
okay ? he 's not here ?
pilar , is uhm -- is amado okay ?
yeah . how about that ? people start digging holes in this county , there 's no telling what 'll come up .
hollis probably told you we found charley wade .
i 'm not open . we were just talking .
he ever accept cash for a favor ?
buddy was more a part of the big picture -- county political machine , chamber of commerce , zoning board if i kept those people happy , he was pretty much on my side . whenever somebody thought -- they start up another bar for the black folks , they 'd be -- how should i put this ? they 'd be officially discouraged .
what was your deal with him ?
what about it ?
and when my father was sheriff ?
could of been . that was white people 's business .
that was the night he disappeared ?
oh -- i think he came in one more time with hollis and -- naw , your daddy was n't with them . made their monthly pickup . roderick was n't in so i just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope .
and that was the last time you saw him ?
i did n't understand the spot i was putting roderick in .
oh , my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys .
how come ?
i only went for my last two years .
just 'cause you went to catholic school and wore a uniform .
enough with the clothes --
i could name five girls at school who have one just like it --
nobody really wears that stuff , paloma .
can i get this ?
yeah . i had uhm -- school business .
you got in late last night .
it 's saturday .
she finally got in --
what do you think ?
what 's she singing about ?
for a while .
you gon na stay out here ?
yeah ?
mom ?
it does n't have anything to do with being smart .
what ?
of course you can .
not if you have half a brain in your head .
chucho montoya saw it with his own eyes . shot him in cold blood .
murdered him ?
he murdered eladio cruz . that tough enough for you ?
i 've heard wade was a bit tough on the mexicans --
out in the fresh air , nice gringo lady making you pies -- who 's gon na sit back in a little jail cell all day ? sheriff buddy , man . como el no hay dos . and after that cabron charley wade --
you built our patio while you were on the county ?
it could have just been a box lunch from the jail .
well , you were working there --
and your mother was a saint . that summer i built the patio at your house ? she made me lunch every day .
so i 've heard --
he was afraid i was going to poison somebody . your father tried to do good for people --
i 'm surprised he bothered with it .
that 's how i ruined my stomach .
different charge . i had a still . made my own mescal .
i thought he busted you a couple times .
your father never bothered me about it . leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s .
i got a bad stomach . it helps me digest .
you 're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana ?
it was for personal consumption .
you stop growing that loco weed at your place , you 'd see a lot more daylight .
three months .
how much you got left ?
time marches on .
hey , pete . how 's it going ?
morning , sheriff .
everything that went before , all that stuff , that history -- the hell with it , right ?
yeah --
we start from scratch --
if i met you for the first time today , i 'd still want to be with you .
i 'm not having any more children . after amado , i had some complications -- i ca n't get pregnant again , if that 's what the rule is about --
i remember thinking you were the one part of my life buddy did n't have a piece of --
from the first time i saw you at school -- all those years we were married to other people i always felt like we were connected .
he paid the hospital bill when you were born . your mom always calls you `` our beautiful daughter '' in the letters she wrote to him .
they ca n't pull this on me . it is n't fair -- i do n't believe this --
buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county . pilar looks away , struggling not to cry --
i 've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before . did n't know she owned one .
try a year and a half . he bands her an old snapshot . pilar looks at it --
couple months before i was born --
you have any idea when your father died ? eladio ?
she 'll figure it out sooner or later . i do n't have to ask permission anymore , if that 's what you mean .
you gon na tell your mother we been seeing each other ?
eladio . eladio . cruz .
what was your father 's name ?
yeah ?
pilar --
it is n't . not by a long shot . he holds her and they lie silently for a moment --
i 've felt that way , yeah .
like your story is over .
do n't have kids . other pictures -- i do n't know -- it 's nothing i want to look back on .
there 's nothing on the walls . no pictures --
two years .
how long have you lived here ?
more , i hope .
so what are we gon na do about this ?
i do n't know . it just feels good . always did .
how come it feels the same ?
yeah .
wow .
i came back 'cause you were here .
yeah ?
you know the other day , you asked why i came back ?
when nando died -- it was so sudden -- i was kind of in shock for awhile . then i woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and i did n't have any idea what to do with it .
nothing .
i mean what did we know about anything ?
yeah .
i look at my kids in school -- tenth , eleventh graders . that 's who we were . children .
yeah .
we thought we were something , did n't we ?
looks real bad if the teacher 's late for class . it 's really nice to talk with you , sam .
pilar --
i should get back .
they 've got me . different thing .
you 've got your mother , your kids --
it can happen so sudden , ca n't it ? being left out on your own .
i got to admit it 's not what i thought it 'd be . back when buddy had it -- hell , i 'm just a jailer . run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows .
you do n't want to be sheriff .
got divorced , i was n't gon na work for my father-in-law anymore . the fellas down here said they 'd back me --
so why did you come back here , sam ?
it might just be the age . i spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack .
fernando was n't pissed off at everybody . he just wanted to fix their cars .
fernando did okay , and he dropped out --
with paloma , it 's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate . but amado -- he 's -- he 's never been book-smart . had a hard time learning to read . me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment -- like a betrayal .
no --
he hates me .
nice-looking kid .
amado .
your boy , there --
weird what you remember .
yeah .
i was on the playground with all the other kids , but i thought he was only looking at me . i was afraid he was going to arrest me -- he had those eyes , you know --
i remember him watching me once . when i was little -- before you and i --
most people did , yeah .
people liked him .
they cooked the whole thing up without asking me .
i thought you got through that pretty well .
so she tells me three times a week .
she 's done well for herself -- on her own and all --
a real palace . she rattles around alone in that thing --
i see she built a place up here by the river .
i ca n't name anybody she does like these days .
your mother still does n't like me .
want to take a walk ?
lunch hour . my next class is n't till nine-thirty .
field trip ?
are you okay ?
he 's all yours .
yeah . i 'll go check on your boy .
we have n't talked since high school .
i was -- i was real sorry about nando . he was a good fella . we have n't talked since .
i 'll see what 's going on .
somebody called -- something about an electronics store .
got him here ?
they 've got my amado .
something wrong ?
well , it 's a complicated issue --
you think we need a new jail ?
i appreciate you telling me .
i did n't want to be going around your back .
do n't know if i 'll still want it .
how 'bout you ?
you 'd do a good job .
yeah .
they want you to stand for sheriff next election .
sam ? i -- the committee -- you know jorge and h.l . and all -- they asked me --
oh .
got ta be in person .
they got telephones .
no -- to mexico . i 've got to talk to somebody .
the republicans ?
i 'm going over to the other side .
uh-huh .
i been working on a few things .
have n't seen much of you at the jail lately .
yeah .
you 're out early .
nothin ' much . the rangers put ben wetzel on it . catch you later .
any poop on the john doe you found out there today ?
okay -- we 'll take a statement from all the gis before they go back to post . you can get the story from otis over at the club .
down from houston . i think he knew the girl before .
the shooter local ?
hospital says the other kid is in bad shape --
you suckers have n't had a good day since the alamo .
this is n't houston , my friend . we pretty much running things now . our good day has come .
white man just using you to keep the black man down .
just doing my job .
you 're the one who 's a good boy . man say `` fetch '' and you fetch --
you been talking so much trash today , you made us think you 're a dangerous criminal . be a good boy , now --
you do n't need to cuff me .
excellent performance , my friend . the judge was very impressed .
and people better clear out of here ! now !
this is a club , sheriff -- you been in here --
what 's this i see ? is that whiskey in them glasses on the bar ? roderick , i 'm gon na have to cite you for a violation of state law --
no , sheriff , i 'm just --
you telling me what to do , roderick ?
you got him too scared to peep , sheriff . maybe if you put that gun up --
otis , apologize to the sheriff --
that the problem , son ? you slow ?
do n't mind him , sheriff . boy 's just a bit slow , is all . he do n't mean nothin ' by it --
the stories people tell , he was a real colorful fella --
sure .
i heard about that deal for your father -- you must be real proud .
yeah . it 's quiet --
we 'll get 'em -- so you livin ' out here now ?
i have n't seen anybody come by .
we had about a dozen wets come over just upriver . they ran into one of our posts -- it was like a breakshot on a pool table , illegals runnin ' every which way .
what 's up ?
hey sam . sorry 'bout that .
the other one ? hell , at my age , every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one . your head 's all crowded up -- here it is --
you know who it was ?
your mother was n't one to get chased off her patch . half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein ' it through .
another woman ?
if he had n't found that deputy job , i believe buddy might 've gone down the other path , got into some serious trouble . settled him right down . that and your mother . 'course he had that other one later .
me neither .
no --
they do n't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole . would you buy this ?
you think he killed anybody in korea ?
for frontera ? hell , i ca n't remember dates no more . i do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him . he almost took some poor fella 's head off at the legion in arroyo grande , and figured it was time to move on .
so when did buddy leave ?
buffalo chips . fella in santa fe told me he sells these as fast as the buffalo can squeeze 'em out .
but you do n't see much competition , do you ?
hell of a spot to put a business .
how am i gon na sell things if nobody comes by ? this stretch of road runs between nowheres and nothin ' much .
you sell much out here ?
-- but longhorns are hard to come by these days .
houston , huh ? i hear they let you boys run wild up there .
been away . up to houston .
how come you do n't took familiar ?
runnin ' numbers without i know about it is both illegal and unhealthy . you remember that .
runnin ' numbers illegal .
as i remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him . must run in the family -- you would n't be runnin ' numbers out of this club , now , would you , son ?
why you think that was ?
i know that .
i sent your daddy to the farm once .
uh-huh .
one of cleroe payne 's boys ?
payne .
otis what ?
name 's otis .
i know you ?
you believe that ?
it 's supposed to be some big sin , even if you love each other .
so ? what 's he gon na do , arrest us ?
he 's gon na find out .
he does n't need to know all my business .
you going to tell him ?
you going to tell her ?
you bet .
have a nice evening , mr. d'amour .
hello , l.a .
tell him he can keep them . the bellboy looks puzzled .
thirty-five bucks .
how much ?
you have n't paid the cab . he wo n't give us your bags 'til you pay him .
yeah ?
yeah . it 's french .
mister d'amour ?
hey , anytime . actually , no . this was enough .
thanks , billy .
i 'm out of here , man ! are you coming ?
hokey enough for you ?
knew what ?
that 's because he knew . he 'd seen these files and knew .
trickery and divinity . yeah , he says that all the time .
what did vinovich say ? something about walking a path between --
i mean , there 's no instructions -- what do you mean , they 're not tricks ?
maybe they 're not tricks .
a nix specialty ?
take a look at this .
doorway ) and who 's that ?
that 's butterfield ...
that would have kept you out of the magic circle . which was presumably the idea . these are about nix .
i could have lost my fucking hands .
nope .
billy ? this was on miller 's forehead . any idea what it is ?
i love weird .
my life was too weird for her .
why ?
yeah . she was killed in a car crash . her lawyer was driving . she was filing for divorce .
you ever been married ?
you heard right .
i hear mrs. swann 's quite a babe .
it 'll be something hokey .
how ?
i 'm sure they 'll have this place rigged .
i think maybe he taught swann . this is me . see ya around .
who is he ?
like in nothing . nobody . nix .
nix ?
nix .
who ?
i 've heard a name . someone they talk about in whispers .
they go together .
i got ta be careful . if vinovich sees me talking to you . he 's an asshole , but he 's a powerful asshole .
that 's so cool .
right .
is n't that french for something ?
right .
d'amour .
d.a.m.o.u.r . d'amour . harry d'amour .
how 'd you spell that again ?
all right . it was ...
who did this ?
i told you --
who did this ?
deep shit ?
you do n't have a clue what you 're into , do you ?
beats me .
why would i do that ?
you did . did n't you ?
it 's an illusion .
what about death ?
death .
about ?
you did n't think it was just going to be you and me ? a lot of people believed in nix . they have n't forgotten his promise .
what do you mean , `` all of us ? ''
we 've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled .
he wo n't .
i do n't want him getting in the way .
no . he 's just a guy who 's got a nose for this shit . like you .
he 's a priest ?
i saw him on t.v . some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard 's life .
i know him . i saw him .
d'amour ... d'amour ... why do i know that name ?
it 's him ... it 's him .
oh christ ! oh christ !
i swear ... this is the place swann told me about . the rocks ...
if you 've lied to me to me --
not yet .
anything ?
you 'll do more.than that .
i 'll tell you .
i do n't know .
so tell me where nix is buried .
do n't .
i could scoop them out .
please .
maybe he 'll show you .
what is he ?
if he was just a man like me , then no . but he 's not .
and you think he 'll be in a fit state to resurrect , after thirteen years ?
i did n't have the skill to resurrect him . i had to teach myself . and that took time .
why did you wait so long ?
like the look of these ? i made them myself , to set him free .
it was me .
jesus . valentin . what did you do to your face ?
he 's with us ... he 's with us ...
he 's with us ...
be ready .
yes ...
will you come to him on your knees ?
yes ...
do you wish him to be amongst us ?
pimm 's dead . jennifer desiderio 's disappeared ...
please ... i was n't there ... ask pimm .
yes .
and are you afraid ?
yes .
so do you . you 've seen the future . have n't you ?
pimm 's dead . jennifer desiderio 's disappeared . they knew the puritan was coming home .
please ... butterfield ... i was n't there . ask pimm .
ever watched a man die ? if you watch very closely , you can sometimes see the soul escaping . and if you 're very quick , you can catch it .
out ! out !
harry- ?
what the fuck ?
i think so .
is it finished ?
i 'm okay . i 'm okay .
harry ?
i ... have ... to .
do n't look .
yes .
... yes ?
i 'm here , harry .
... oh ... god ...
harry ...
no ! no ! no !
nix has got to have a weak spot . everybody 's got a fucking weak spot .
you ca n't .
i 've got to help him .
hang on !
oh god !
it 's all right . it 's not hurting ...
harry ?
find valentin ! find him ! get him in here !
are you all right ?
it 's okay .
what was that ?
and pimm and swann . only nix was ready for them .
quaid and jennifer --
yes .
and they all came ...
i was twelve . nix took me hostage , to get swann to come to him .
i know . i 'm the one who shot him .
i 'm sure . he 's dead .
are you sure ?
do n't be . nix ca n't hurt you now .
i was so afraid .
nothing you do n't want .
nothing ?
nothing 's going to happen to you .
i 'm here , are n't i ?
no it is n't . you ca n't help me .
it 's okay .
he thought nix was coming back , did n't he ?
i was grateful to him . i owed him my life . and he loved me . he could n't always show it , but he felt it .
what then ?
i was n't .
you said you were n't with him for love .
no .
too much fame . yeah , i guess that 'd turn anybody 's head . including yours .
i told you --
so swann was performing magic . not illusions ? and what ? you thought he should be using it to cure cancer , not making millions .
some or it .
he taught all this to swann ?
he could get into people 's heads . make them see things . terrible things . and he could levitate . juggle fire .
stuff ?
swann said he could do stuff , yes .
he was the real thing , right ?
it was more than that , i think .
nix ran some kind of cult , right ? some kind of charlie manson deal ?
why do n't you tell me the truth ?
oh christ .
jennifer desiderio , for one . she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon .
what did you find ?
i did n't leave . i was just digging around .
flesh is a trap . that 's what he used to say . flesh is a trap and magic sets us free . why did you come back ?
yes . you do that .
okay . i 'll keep digging .
it does n't ring a bell . i have to go .
what about jennifer desiderio ?
yes ... i 'm here . and no . i do n't know the name .
just curious . back to business . ever heard of a man called nix ? dorothea ?
that 's my business . harry .
so why did you marry him ?
you did n't marry him for love .
he ... did n't have me.. i told you-
why ? because he had you ?
they were jealous of him .
i went up to the magic castle . you were right . he did n't have a lot of fans up there .
how did it go today ?
forget the fee . if i find butterfield , maybe we 'll talk about money . if i do n't ... ... my gamble . either way ... i get to spend some time ... here .
yes . i think you probably can . we 'd need to talk about your fee .
i can be very persuasive .
they wo n't tell you anything .
well ... how about some of the other illusionists ?
i do n't know where you 'd start .
i 'm sorry i got into this too late . but if you want me to stick around , maybe dig where the cops do n't look ...
i heard what happened . it looks like somebody murdered him .
are they treating you okay ?
you have n't seen anything yet .
he 's good .
sure .
i did n't marry him for love , mr. d'amour . tonight ?
do you ?
come to the show with me . tonight i want you to see him with an audience . they love him .
when do you want me to start ?
that 's not what i 'm asking for . i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards . and stop it from happening .
i 'm no bodyguard .
harry .
harry .
will you take the job , mr. d'amour ?
where do i sign ?
no . you 're right . he could have been something more . maybe a lot more . but people get lost . even good people . too much fame . too much money ,
sorry . you asked .
he 's an illusionist . it 's not exactly brain surgery .
you do n't believe me .
we would n't be having this conversation if i did n't . swann 's one of the most remarkable men alive .
but obviously you still care what happens to him .
we have n't slept in the same bed for years .
does that mean ... ?
we do n't share our lives the way a lot of people do .
and you do n't ask questions ?
he 's a secretive man .
why not ?
i do n't exactly know . philip does n't like to talk about the past .
what 's the connection ?
i think we make our own futures .
you do n't ?
yes . they were n't close , but they saw each other once in a while . i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards .
did your husband know quaid ?
i want you to help me help my husband . i know he 's in some kind of trouble . and it 's something to do with the man you saw murdered .
nix was never interested in you . it was always swann .
what about me ?
i left three messages already .
harm to whom ? me ? i do n't think , so . try him again at the hotel .
it 's better he 's gone . he would have done more harm than good .
no word from d'amour ?
crank call . i 'll get the number changed .
you saw this ?
good . there . yes ?
valentin ?
no . i 'm not going near him .
sure . you want me to find out about quaid ? i mean , the funeral ?
i 'm putting in a new illusion tonight . will you be there ?
i just saw him .
oh god .
somebody killed him .
sure .
yeah . remember quaid ?
... they believe you .
the usual . full house . standing ovation . i tell them it 's magic ...
bad show last night ?
no . not yet ...
for now . are you planning to go back to new york ?
are you finished with me ?
another fucking magician . jesus .
-- vanished .
and this butterfield guy --
after that fall ? . he must have broken half his bones .
he got up and walked .
where the fuck is he ?
new one on me . okay . let 's see him .
i got a file on him two inches thick . he 's a petty fraudster . this is something else . ever heard of someone called the puritan ?
what makes you so sure ?
tapert 's got nothing to do with this . he came here to get his palm read .
tapert . so , now i 've got tapert , butterfield .
i 'm a private detective . i was hired to follow somebody for a few days . a guy called tapert . insurance fraud .
what were you doing up there ?
fuck you .
great accent , by the way . is it brooklyn ?
evil . he was evil . come on .
with what ?
he was a freak . everything he did was tainted .
just tell me about swann . or are you too scared ?
i 'm not saying another word . you damn fool . he 's a journalist .
i 'd like to hear them .
oh , i 've got plenty .
you tell me . no ? i thought you 'd maybe have a theory .
if he was so good why 's he so dead ?
i heard he was the best .
they were n't worth a damn .
what about swann 's miracles ?
i could reproduce any miracle that 's ever been performed , with a little preparation .
so could you walk on water ?
no . i 'm saying they were always fake . the saints , the messiahs , they were just illusionists .
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real ?
trickery and divinity .
heaven and hell ?
i think we walk a narrow path , between ... between ...
you believe that ?
... looks like you 're going ... to lose ... one more .
what about ?
i 'm sorry , d'amour ...
shut up . we 've lost enough lives already .
do n't bother .
we 've got to get you to a hospital .
him too .
help me .
shit ...
d'amour --
why do n't you leave this alone ? let everybody think it 's over ?
i want to see swann face to face .
have n't you seen enough to know that does n't matter ?
nix is dead and buried , for fuck 's sake .
no . it was mine . i did n't want any more bloodshed . that 's why we went to all this trouble , so there 'd be no one for nix to come after .
was that swann 's idea ?
i tried to pay you off .
and then ... because i was getting too close to something -- -- or someone , you called swann
yes .
you paid off the doctor . you set up the fake body . yes ?
yes .
you rigged the illusion to fail , right ?
no .
are you satisfied now ?
shut up !
leave her alone --
you want more money , is that it ?
yeah , i know .
i ca n't let you in .
when will she be in ?
i 'm afraid she 's not in .
i want to speak to dorothea .
no .
why people die ? give it up , d'amour . go home .
i like to know why things happen .
what for ? you need to stay busy ?
fuck regrettable ! i want to know why .
yes . it 's regrettable
left alone ? somebody 's been murdered .
she does n't want to see you . she 's had enough pain . enough churning over the past . she wants it all left alone .
you did n't hire me . she did . if she wants me off the job , i want to hear it from her .
a ticket home ,
what for ?
you 're a detective , with no clues . where else are you going to look ? i 'm going to keep this brief . here 's thirty thousand dollars .
why 'd you come here ?
looking for you . i tried the hotel .
what the fuck are you doing here ?
swann 's wife .
who is she ?
are you a believer , then ?
are you sure ?
i do n't think the dead much care .
it 's not a bad place . warm . great view .
probably .
any movie stars buried here ?
illusions are trickery . magicians do it for real .
what 's the difference ?
never call him that . he 's strictly an illusionist .
when i can afford to lose . swann 's quite a magician .
are you a gambling man ?
i saw him in vegas once .
you know of him ?
philip swann ?
you could almost pass for a detective , d'amour . i work for the best illusionist in the world .
havanas . you 're not the smoker . so who is ?
somebody 's been smoking in here for months .
maybe i just bought it .
nah . you 're driving it too carefully .
mine .
whose is the car ?
have you got a job that 'll pay you five thousand a day ?
i 'm going back to new york in -- shit ! i 'm outta here .
i 'm here to offer you a job .
then what do you want ?
we 've never met .
whatever i said , i did n't mean it , okay ? i get a few drinks inside me --
i need to speak to you , mr. d'amour . about last night .
what are you , my mother ?
it 's one in the afternoon .
go away .
mr. d'amour ?
shit .
and what does jennifer think 's real ?
oh yes . we have to agree what 's real and what 's not . that 's what holds us together .
does anybody ?
she has no real grip on reality .
what 's her problem ?
jennifer 's been with us four years . she was coming on nicely . but just the last month or so , she 's worse than ever .
i wo n't say anything .
right . and he 's dead , is n't he ? i saw it on the news . jennifer does n't know . and frankly , this is n't the best tine for her to be told .
a mister quaid ?
jennifer 's only ever had one visitor .
who is he ?
yes ...
the puritan ?
i 'm not afraid to die . there 's something terrible ... coming home ...
hold on .
you ca n't change it . you have to walk ... ... walk the line between heaven and hell . it 's your destiny . accept it .
not much .
you 're drawn to the dark side , over and over . and it 's drawn to you . you do n't like that .
yeah . you could say that .
you 've taken some strange journeys in your life .
what ?
my god .
too late . why are you here ? did you cone ... up here for a reading ?
you need an ambulance .
no . there 's only three keys . vinovich has got one , of course . he 's a little crazy , by the way . and he 's a mean drunk . otherwise , he 's a real charmer .
have you been in ?
that 's what they call the repository . every magic secret known to man 's locked up in that room .
it 's not a business . harry . it 's a vocation .
are they all in the business ?
you do n't get in without one . it 's like a gentlemen 's club for illusionists . except most of us are n't gentlemen .
i only wear ties for funerals .
well ... nobody .
for an introduction .
for what ?
people are pretty cagey . who do you know ?
i 'd love to ... you know ... hang with some of you guys .
he knew swann way back . he says there were a lot of drugs , a lot of crazy shit .
sure . vivovich .
you know vinovich ?
not the walter wilder ?
you do n't know the half of it . i 'm walter wilder , by the way .
was he taking a lot of risks ?
what a tragedy . it was just a matter of time , of course , but it 's not good for the business .
i 'm in from new york . i came to see swann .
i know all the kids coming up . got to stay ahead of the game . but i do n't know you .
harry d'amour .
at birth . i do n't know you --
that .
what ?
where 'd you learn that ?
try .
i do n't know .
can you do it ?
yes ?
he did something with the ground .
i ca n't ... i ca n't go any further ...
you did n't try hard enough .
this is where we killed him .
fuck .
at a guess ... they just resurrected him .
jesus ... what the hell 's going on in there ?
in my time , and nobody else 's .
that 's where we 're all going .
you do n't get it , do you ? we 're shit . d'amour .
nobody 's better off this wav !
he 's better off this way .
... no ...
looks that way .
they got here before us .
jesus !
yes .
who else did ? did valentin ?
no .
did she know where nix was buried ?
i saw it with my own fucking eyes ! see , that 's his best trick . no illusions . just the truth . are you ready for that ?
and you believed him ?
no . at the end ... when we had him cornered , he got into my head . he showed me what we really look like , when the veneer 's gone . jelly . shit ...
is that all ?
he had something . he showed me how to bend the rules . a little levitation . a few fireworks .
and he did n't have them ?
oh , i was going to discover the secret of the universe . that 's why i liked nix . he promised me all these explanations .
and you 're not ?
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes . it 's like a public service . it does n't mean much in the end . they 're all going to die .
is that all ?
i can do a lot of shit , d'amour . but you know that . so i like playing games with people . gives them something to wonder about ...
did n't know you read minds .
you think i 'm an asshole .
will that do ? no ?
oh jeez .
help me .
i do n't know what else to do .
and she shot him i i think that 'd piss me off if i were nix .
it 's me betrayed him .
so nix wo n't come looking for her ?
now that i 'm dead , the spotlight 's off her .
oh yeah ?
i did it for dorothea .
maybe he does n't see it that way . maybe he 's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now . that 's what you 're hiding away from , is n't it ?
he deserved it .
or murdered , like nix .
illusionists get . las vegas contracts , d'amour . magicians get burned .
you know , it 's such a fucking waste . you can do shit most of us can only dream about , and you go around pretending it 's some trick .
why ? so you can fuck my wife ?
i do n't think so . you need me alive .
now i 'm going to have to kill you .
how the fuck do you do that ?
you should n't have followed me , d'amour .
look , ma , no wires .
they 'll never find out .
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you 're still alive .
who is she ?
what ?
one question .
a couple of weeks .
yeah . but not as cheap . call me .
there 's other guys as good as me , loomis .
call me tomorrow .
i got to go . i 'm late .
you never took a fucking vacation in your life , harry . what 's going on ?
no . i 'm taking a couple of weeks ' vacation .
the case is closed . harry . tapert 's given us a full confession . get your ass back to mew york .
no . he 's coming back . he 's digging his way out !
and he 's dead ?
yes ! yes !
is he the puritan ?
nix ! nix !
who 's not ?
he 's not ! he 's not !
swann ?
i do n't want to think about it . if i think about it he 'll hear me . he 'll find me .
what is ?
he said he knew how to protect us . but he did n't know anything . he made us think it was over and done with .
why 's that ?
i knew swann . he 's a fucking liar .
what about philip swann ?
maybe ... i ... do n't ...
well , you did n't forget me . i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield .
only i forget . they give me pills , you know , to keep me ... even ... and ... i forget things ,
no .
have we met before ?
liar !
no !
wait ... you still feel something for that bitch ?
yes .
but until then ... it 's you and me ... the way it always was .
yes .
you know i 'll kill you when we 're done . i have to .
the woman has a new love in her life . your friends are dead . nobody 's left to save you , but me
not true .
because you 've got nothing else to live for .
why would i want to ?
you could still help me do that .
i should have been honest with you , right from the start . i was n't born to show people the error of their ways . i was born to murder the world .
and ?
binding you .
swann ? what are you doing ?
you want to be like that , swann ? mud and shit ?
do n't touch me . he 's got ... got into my head .
no !
you do n't think i 've got it to give ?
fuck you .
i 've got so much power to give you , swann . all you have to do is ... beg .
yeah , i 'll stay .
you 'll do it ?
ok .
so , we got you on an earlier flight , but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show .
oh , hi , elaine .
bob , it 's me .
hello ?
oh , great . i 'll talk to you later , bye .
ok , you 're scheduled to leave saturday , but we 'll hold a seat thursday in case , but first class is full , you 're waitlisted for an upgrade ... there might be a seat on lufthansa ...
just get me out of here as soon as you can .
these people are paying you a lot , do you think you could consider it ?
yeah , they told me .
we 're looking into it bob , but they really want you to stay to do that talk show friday , apparently it 's a really big deal , he 's the johnny carson of japan .
can you get me on a flight thursday night ?
i 'll miss you .
why are you crying ?
ok , bye .
thanks .
well ... have a good flight .
yes .
you 're leaving right now ?
yes , no .
just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave ?
that 'd be great .
uh , yeah ... i 'll bring it down .
i 'm just leaving ... . do you have my jacket ?
hi , bob .
charlotte ?
i do n't know , it just does n't , reality changes things ... .we ca n't stay here forever , unless maybe we started a jazz band .
why ca n't it last ?
i know . but , it does n't last , you have to go back sometime .
i do n't want to go back tomorrow .
well , i mean it more now .
that 's what you said the other night .
i 'm going to miss you .
tomorrow .
when are you leaving ?
that lunch was the worst , huh .
i 'm sorry .
around .
so , where 'd you go today .
a coke .
what do you want to drink ?
you 're a brat , was n't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention ?
well , i guess she 's more around your age ... you guys could talk about things in common , like growing up in the fifties .
no , we 'll find something around here .
you ca n't get sushi anywhere in japan after 2 o'clock . did you know that ?
i do n't want to be .
oh , i guess you 're busy , huh .
yes , but no , i ca n't right now .
i 'm going to daikanyama , do you want to come walk around ?
no .
do you know where we are ?
yeah .
do you ever see him ?
working .
where 's your husband ?
yeah , look at that thing .
you think so ?
we should get you to the doctor .
it 's bad is n't it ?
i do n't know , i think maybe i broke it ? i knocked into something the other day ...
what happened to your toe ?
fuck off .
nice one .
oh , she 'll love it .
four .
how old is she ?
it 's for my daughter .
they really have to work on that street name thing .
you made it .
because that would be too easy .
why do you have to be with your opposite , why cant similar people be together ?
i know , but that 's what you like about me .
you are .
john thinks i 'm so snotty .
i know .
in d.c. , my dad was the ambassador to france in the eighties , so we went to school in paris for a few years ... but we mostly lived in d.c. , and they were never around ... and then i moved to los angeles when john and i got married ... it 's so different there .
where 'd you grow up ?
that 's nice . my parents were always traveling , they were n't around so much .
but , it 's great being with them , after they can talk , and can do things with you .
no one ever tells you that ...
when they 're born its like vietnam . it 's terrifying .
that 's too scary .
we used to have fun , she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos , but now she 's tired of it all . she never wants to leave the kids , she does n't need me , and they do n't need me , i feel like i 'm in the way . it gets complicated when you have kids ... that changes everything .
oh .
we established that we have no communication .
did that help ? did you learn anything ?
it 's hard . we started going to a marriage counselor .
and marriage , does that get easier ?
that 's ok .
but , i 'm mean .
you 'll figure it out . i 'm not worried about you . keep writing .
i just do n't know what i 'm supposed to be . i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer ... but i hate what i write , and i tried taking pictures , but john 's so good at that , and mine are so mediocre ... and every girl goes through a photography phase , like horses , you know dumb pictures of your feet ...
thanks . it does , the more you know who you are ... you do n't care about things the same way ...
yeah ? but look at you .
no , yes , it does ...
i 'm stuck . does it get easier .
i know .
you 're possessive .
oh .
no , for a candlelight dinner , yes , for her show .
oh , for her show ?
i got a fax today from your friend hiromix .
oh . well ... they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the sex pistols on kings road ...
no , i was looking at you .
did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi ?
ok , whatever you want .
let 's never come here again , because it would never be as much fun .
i do n't know . my fax said `` have a good fright '' .
why do they switch the r 's and l 's here ?
i know , i kind of blend in here .
i do n't remember .
no , you smiled .
did i scowl at you ?
yeah , you do n't remember ?
really ?
but the first time i saw you was in the elevator .
do you remember when we met at the bar ? ... you were wearing a tuxedo .
i do n't know .
how 'd a japanese guy get a name like hans ?
no , its easy .
i think he kind of liked me ... is that so hard to imagine ?
hans was very attentive to you .
i see them every morning .
hey look , it 's sausalito .
ok , see you downstairs .
yeah , i 'm going to take a shower and i 'll meet you downstairs .
do you want to have some breakfast ?
of course .
thanks for getting me back in one piece .
charlotte , who ?
it 's charlotte .
hello ?
i know . i do n't either .
i do n't want to go home .
ok .
i could cut the ones that are left for you .
no way .
what do you feel like singing , bob ?
hi , charlie .
charlie , this is bob . bob charlie brown .
no .
a soul 's search : finding your true calling - are you reading this ?
i know , it 's stupid .
you really are having a mid-life crisis .
see you later .
ok .
oh , good . do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here ?
i 'm here for the week .

hi . did you have a nice swim ?
oh , hi .
who do i have to fuck to get off this planet ?
hi again , how 's it going ?
thanks .
thanks . i 'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out , too .
it takes a while to figure it out . i 'm sure you will , though .
i do n't know , but i can think about it , a lot .
oh , what do you do with that ?
philosophy .
what did you study ?
i 'm not sure , yet ... i graduated last spring .
what do you do ?
oh .
yes ... i do n't know , i do n't know her anymore . i do n't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time . i was ... actually i was in love with her sister first , when i was twenty-one . and one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to paris , so i said okay , and she said no , she wanted to move to paris with francois , and she 's still married to him . and i moved in with lydia ... but i always really liked lydia .
25 years ... that 's a long time ... are you still in love with your wife ?
i 'm thinking about it .
you 're probably just having a mid- life crisis . did you buy a porche ?
try twenty-five .
two years .
how long have you been married ?
my husband 's here for work-he 's a photographer- and i just came along ... i 'm not really doing anything right now , and we have some friends who live here .

oh , peter , you 're going to pursue this .
now that you 're on tv , you 're a magnet for all the wackos out there .
says she can get me in to see this killer .
did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings ?
sorry . it 's just ... a strange woman waltzes into my office today . tells me she murdered her parents and can prove satan exists .
peter , where are you ?
you know , there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we 're losing daylight . quarks and dark matter , things like that . even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast , you know ?
hmmm .
i ca n't believe it 's already starting to get dark so early .
sushi .
uh ... sure ... i ... what ?
i must really be slacking off . hungry ?
weird . the book again . sex spelled backwards ...
bad ?
shi ... sorry , honey . i was having the weirdest dream .
it 's probably trivial .
you never said anything to me ...
it 's susan 's cooking , claire . that 's why uncle james lets them stay .
it 's great of you to let william and susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet .
she 's a talk show host . they ca n't be charmed . by definition .
how 'd your interview go ? i 'm sure you charmed the hell out of sally .
do you think they have a room here ?
i missed you .
eight . that okay ?
what time did you make it for ?
you know , i made a reservation at marco 's for peter 's birthday dinner , but maybe you should cater it .
yes . it 's exactly ...
... you wearing a watch , father ?
well , if peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you ...
frustrating . form over content . everything 's so retro .
nonsense , it 's all of our home . so how 's work treating you ?
peter , are you okay ?
what a ... jerk !
just me .
tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and mr. viznick .
he asked to go home early . he said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do .
on the day of the murders what did the defendant request ?
seemed ... on edge .
and on the day of the murders , his state of mind ?
quiet . real quiet ...
and how would you describe him ?
yes .
i 'm gon na go make a stink . sit tight . i 'll make sure you get a change of clothes .
i can take care of myself .
you have to tell me who did it .
not the guards . some of the prisoners are easily disturbed .
sure it is . if the guards did this , we can file charges .
it 's nothing .
george , come in . what the hell happened to you ?
of course not . they put him through severe mental stress . causing this aneurysm .
so you do n't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural ?
you should know i never felt mr. birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care . and then , minutes after they left , he suffered a stroke . he 's comatose . no brain wave activity at all .
no , i was n't , actually .
you 're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism .
my secretary ?
when your secretary called , she made no mention of her coming , too .
quite a compliment coming from you , doctor .
mr. kelson , what a pleasure to meet you . i have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable . i am a fan .
i think i should join you .
father jeremy and deacon john townsend of st. ursula 's , and our associate , maya larkin . secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified . maya is eminently qualified .
i 'm aware of that , but i do n't think he 's in any condition to make requests . i 'm trying to appeal to your more ... logical self , father . i 'm concerned about harm to my patient .
it 's the patient 's request , doctor .
this patient has been plagued with temporal lobe seizures .
but your patient is legally entitled to it .
you know i 'm not comfortable with this .
your court order , dr. allen .
you heard voices , you know you did .
there is a medical explanation for everything that happened .
and was he in distress when you opened the door ? or was he sitting here , relaxed , at this table ?
the patient was in great distress . naturally he was ... yelling .
what did you hear ?
i certainly hope you 're not lending any credence to this .
dr. allen , could you please tell mr. kelson what you heard as you tried to enter mr. birdson 's room ?
i do n't have the experience . father thomas should officiate .
you 'll do it ?
you have a sister in new orleans .
father , i have nowhere else to stay .
i 've had it . townsend 's dead . the police are calling and now i see you having a scene in front of the children . i 'm sorry , maya , you 've been with us for many years , but effective immediately , i 'm rescinding your right to live at the church .
i hope so .
is he going to be okay ?
but bad judgement . and now you see how dangerous the consequences can be .
he will . he has great faith .
the doctor 's concerned he may never come out of this dementia .
maya , for the last time , i will not tolerate these obsessions .
if you really believe in god , why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real ?
please , maya . i 'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense .
you were n't there . give me time to get some proof .
i do n't mean to belittle you , but we 've been through this before . satan is not what you think he is . satan is not some creature .
i had to . there was no other way . their deaths were part of the greatest legacy i could have given you .
you killed my parents .
you are my son . do n't you see the opportunity that lies before you ?
you raised me , like a son .
everything i did , i did for you . i love you , peter . think of it . i 'm giving you a gift , absolute power and knowledge .
you lied to me my whole life . everything you said , everything you did .
it was perfect . the harder i pushed , the more you pulled away .
so all that bullshit about god and faith .
do n't you get it ? they had their 2,000 years . now it 's our turn .
you fucking bastard .
you know , i respect that you have such faith , james . i do n't understand it , but i want you to know that despite our differences , i admire you and i always will .
peter . your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you .
but it 's true . i have no faith . it 's strange . when that gun was pointed at my face tonight , i was surprised , but never frightened . it was as if i knew nothing could possibly happen to me and ... in that one moment i did n't care about anything . not eve my own life .
no matter , my son , he believes in you .
you 're right , but it 's funny . all my life i thought i was simply a man who did n't believe in any of it .
listen to me , peter . you ca n't let the ravings of a madman disturb you , okay ?
yeah . it did n't make any sense .
he spoke to you ?
something he said , just before ...
what is it ?
given all that 's happened , i understand . the world is random , but then there 's faith . where are you in death without it ?
you know how i feel . the world is random . the only certainty i believe in is death .
between your book sales and this tv thing , there 's going to be no living with you . and let me guess , you boiled god down to a conceit .
you ready ?
how 're you doing ? looking lovely as always .
... art sank , sun set , ark sank again ...
father , please do n't die .
miette , come here and relax .
so i guess satan lost . satan is the weak one .
would you like to rest , miette ? you must be exhausted .
so , if christ won , that means , what does that mean , father ? that satan ...
um hm . that 's right , maya .
we won because christ ... triumphed over satan ?
yes . we won , that 's right .
so ... we won ?
well , in my prayers , i realized we 've been fooling ourselves and probably ... blown this all out of proportion . god would never allow anything like that to happen .
what do you mean `` do n't worry ? ''
do n't worry ... about the transformation , maya .
father ! thank god you 're better ! i really need your help . we 've only got a few more hours .
... the ark sank , the sun set , the ark sank again ...
father , i 'm right here .
... the ark sank , the sun set , the ark sank again .
just open the door , please .
-- you would n't last five minutes .
i know , maya , but you 'll understand when you see this man . i really need your strength .
why are you doing this to me ?
oh , thank you , thank you so much !
two negatives always make a positive .
i did n't know what else to do ...
you just call ?
peter ... peter kelson .
what 's his name ?
well i know he 's come here before .
you need his blood-type . like right away .
thirteen . the last time , can you believe it ? this is how he says `` goodbye ? ''
how many weeks are you honey/
i took one of those home pregnancy tests , but i do n't want to tell him . i 'm rh negative . my blood type is negative ... if he 's rh positive , i 'll have to terminate .
kelson , hold on a second ...
hi , i 'd like to make an appointment for peter kelson .
it 's me . put the gun down . maya ...
oh , peter .
not a lot .
how much time do we have ?
and what 's that mean ?
book five , deuteronomy , chapter seven , verse five . `` but this shall you deal with them . you shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire . ''
and his message was `` together , no matter what ? ''
he was trying to tell me something .
terrific .
that 's his , i do n't know , his 'grounding ' phrase for me , `` together , no matter what . ''
what did he say to you in french ?
he 's been repeating that since birdson 's exorcism . i looked in every passage in the bible and there 's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything .
so , what does it mean . the ark sank and the sun set ?
i 'll be all right . peter , at the very end , i think father was back . i saw it in his eyes .
you have to be experienced to do this . just wait outside . otherwise , you risk killing him .
what can i do ?
sure .
maybe i should check lareaux 's book . it 's in the car . be right back . do n't go anywhere .
i do n't know . extra apartment keys . what 's it matter ?
what are these ?
plenty of time .
only your body will remain . i believe your soul will be at peace . if we kill you , satan ca n't stay .
what about after ?
until it happens , you 're still a human being .
why did n't you just go along with townsend . get rid of me . i would 've ...
maybe that 's my problem .
no oxygen to the brain .
i know it is . right after my parents died , i went to the beach ... i was in the water . everything was calm . and then one of those really big waves hit me . hard . pulled me straight to the bottom . i struggled and finally ran out of air . if it had n't been for my sister who pulled me out , i would 've drowned . legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me .
close call . for the first time in a long time , it 's really hitting me . life 's tenuous .
i was desperate . i knew you wrote about murders . i needed a way in .
why did you lie to me about your parents ' deaths ?
that 's true .
you have to say that .
we 're going to do this .
i 'm scared i 'm slipping back .
i see things . my worst fears . you need to know something , peter . i was possessed once . like birdson . it took father lareaux six days to pull me out of it .
what do you mean ?
sometimes , when i feel weak , i have these ... visions .
are you alright ?
comfort .
what 's the bible for ?
there 's nothing else here .
i do n't know . probably have a copy of my birth certificate ... my apartment .
he could n't stop us and that 's how he was punished . peter , what time were you born ?
that ca n't be right . my birthday 's tomorrow .
it 'll happen at the exact time of your birth .
your 33rd birthday . the transformation will be a perversion of christ 's rising from the dead . townsend discovered it in one of lareaux 's books .
hang on , get it up , go on , higher .
what ?
when 's your birthday ?
you okay ?
what ?
peter , let go of the chair !
what 's the ... oh shit !
get up ! !
i 'll go outside and take a look in the garage .
nothing yet .
i 'm going to look around .
we needed to know all we could .
the books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out .
what are you looking for exactly ?
townsend , he had some of father 's books .
when townsend tried to kill me , he said something strange like ... `` the time of transformation is near ... ''
i do n't know . i do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way . i do n't know if it works the same way in this instance . i do n't even know when it 's going to happen .
and if what you 're saying is true , what would happen to me ?
peter , i believe your baptism was perverted . look at your certificate . your mother was the only witness to it . your blood-type does n't match who you thought your father was . peter ... i 'm sorry .
then why are you here ?
so ... then the coroner 's report is probably wrong . i mean ... this is ridiculous . there 's been a mistake . i do n't believe any of this .
peter , your blood-type is ab negative . there 's no way your birth father can be o positive . you father is not who you think he is .
i looked at the coroner 's report . my father 's o positive and my mother ... a negative .
do you know your parents ' blood types ?
yes .
seven years . one baptism ? he 's your mother 's only brother
so what ?
the only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at bedford .
yes , i know .
you were not baptized . at least i do n't believe it was christian . your baptism was performed by your uncle , james mckenzie .
but i was baptized . and i certainly was n't born of incest .
there 's no reason why you should . this has been planned from your birth . you fit all the criteria that we know of . never baptized , born of incest , devoid of faith ...
i do n't understand what 's going on .
if you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again ...
you 're about to become the anti-christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world .
my parents are dead . do n't even think of bringing them into this .
i know this sounds crazy . i understand . check your parents ' blood types . are you sure your parents are your birth parents ?
i 'm not going to be drawn into this .
you 're already contaminated . it 's why you could n't hear the tape . there 's probably a pentacle near your bed . to sanctify you .
you should think about getting professional help .
the good outwitting the bad . it 's like birdson had a split personality .
trick him .
if you 're possessed , you ca n't reveal anything satan wants hidden . unless you trick him .
why did n't birdson just say so ?
it 's true . birdson knew your name , he was writing it in numerical code . it was n't easy but i figured it out . it spelled your name .
what ? ! ? !
at the exorcism , birdson boasted that satan is about to take over the body of a man . you are that man , peter .
and the point is ?
townsend believed , just as god became man in christ . so satan will assume human form . i believe it too .
why did he try to kill me ?
please , the children .
last night a guy named john townsend tried to shoot me and now i find out you knew him . what the fuck is going on ?
peter , please ...
we need to talk .
well , why should i ? alright , what 's your name , where do you live , when did you kill your parents ?
that 's their explanation . you might not believe me ...
and this is evil ? the guy had an aneurysm and now he 's in a coma .
i had to .
where do you get off pretending to be my secretary ?
you 're right . i must 've made a mistake .
so what 'd i miss ?
i cranked it all the way up . nothing but hum .
you 're sure ? there was nothing ?
it was blank . nothing on it . you gave me the wrong one .
what do you mean ?
i think you gave me the wrong one .
so ... what did you think of the tape .
well , i think it 's very simple . here 's a tape of birdson 's exorcism . i 'll be at the public library . tomorrow at 2 ... if you want to meet him .
the world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil . unfortunately i find it much more slippery and elusive place .
on television , you seemed so sure of yourself . if you 're really that confident , you 'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong ?
i 'll bet .
an exorcism was just held for birdson . it failed . disastrously . which means there 's still a demonic spirit present in his body . i was wondering , perhaps you 'd like to go meet henry . he 's pretty amazing .
i do .
last week the catholic church certified him as genuinely possessed . you realize how rarely they make that ruling ?
what 's that got to do with you ?
do you remember henry birdson ? the math professor who won the salwen medal , then went home and killed his family ?
well , then it all seems to be working out for you . listen , ms ... ?
in the end , the jury saw it my way .
ooooooh-kayyyyyy .
i murdered my parents , mr. kelson . and while they deserved it , i still went to confession the following sunday .
well , by saying that , you 're acknowledging the existence of a higher power . which , to a narcissist , is impossible .
and i also believe in god and the devil . in fact , i know they exist .
a narcissist does n't admit it . it 's the extreme of self-denial .
what if i told you i was a malignant narcissist ?
not the most popular opinion , but yes .
that there is no such thing as evil with a capital `` e . ''
listen , i 'm sorry , but i 'm running late .
and also that ...
not pure evil . that 's correct .
you said that malignant narcissism was not evil .
thank you . do you work in the building ? you coming from the party ?
i saw you on television yesterday . you were brilliant .
yes ... and you are ?
peter kelson ?
may i help you ?
... as a narcissist , he could n't blame himself . he created the voices after the fact .
oh my god !
i 'm not waiting until it 's too late .
look , john , i 'm facing it .
you do n't want to face it .
sure of what ? who cares if this guy is devoid of faith or sleeps over a pentacle ? results are what lareaux would want .
you ca n't back out on me now . we need to be sure .
it 's useless ... look at him .
alright , maya . we 'll do it your way .
we 'll see father frank in the morning . there 's nothing to be done until then .
i 've dealt with these people before , maya . they 're not going to help us .
we need all the help we can get .
a lot of good that 'll do .
i 've filed a report with father frank .
and what are you thinking we should do now ?
i 'll explain everything later . can you meet me tonight ?
maya ? what do you mean ?
i know who he is .
hello ?
whish the circumstances were different .
good seeing you again .
goodbye .
get out of here .
you do know , do n't you . that these are also numbers . greek numbers , 600 , 60 and 6 - or 666. the sign of the devil .
suit yourself . but does this mean anything to you ?
you know what ? you can go .
viznick will get off and michael 's got a crush on you .
nothing you could n't find out from reading the papers . and you 're already wrong on one count .
but she worships you . your mother 's dead but your father 's alive .
you are the younger of two ...
i 'd appreciate it if you 'd put that back .
nice suit .
i 'll be at bedford tonight , if you need me .
the police used him as a witness in this case .
i think it 's gon na be a waste of time .
he can see you thursday .
what about that psychic , what 's his name , szabo ?
mr. kelson , here 's the stuff you wanted on pathological narcissism .
we millionaires yet ?
good of you to stop by .
it 's detective smythe .
yeah .
you watch . one day , i 'll hit the jackpot , get the big house , car , clothes . i 'll have more money than god .
you know what they say . you have the same chance of winning whether you play or not .
sometimes i can just feel the numbers .
lem me guess . the lottery .
i plan to . you want a tip ?
of course .
would you sign it for me ?
and what about you ? what about peter kelson ? where is your moral compass ?
right . if you believe in god . as a narcissist , viznick could n't blame himself for the alleged murders . he created the voices after the fact . in order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides george viznick and that george viznick needs to pay .
meaning , viznick 's a man who answers to no one . not even god .
well , george viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum . viznick is not psychotic . he 's simply unable to submit to any higher authority .
are you saying he 's legally sane ?
well , we all have a degree of narcissism , sally , but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed .
what do you mean by that ?
as if there 's another cause for little voices ? no , sally , viznick 's a manipulator , he 's clever , he has what i call malignant narcissism .
not even from some mental illness , as the prosecution asserts ?
there were n't any voices .
you 're referring to the defense 's efforts to prove that george viznick is tormented by `` demonic voices ? ''
no , the less mystifying . good and evil are only illusions . there is no such thing as evil with a capital `` e. '' that suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings .
it 's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil , the less evil it becomes .
well , long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject . after awhile , you begin to make friends with it , so to speak .
peter , you 're now writing a book about the viznick case . you seem to be making a career of studying sensational murderers . i have to ask , how does it make you feel when you sit in courtrooms day after day , face to face with alleged killers ?
thanks for having me , sally .
as a part of today 's story on the trial of mass murderer george viznick , we welcome peter kelson , author of the current best-seller , vicious intent . thank you for joining us , peter .
had to let her go . i see you thinkin ' there , superstar . do n't .
where is she now ?
we hauled her in earlier but did n't have anything hard to tie her to townsend . far as the priest goes , he wo n't be bothering you . suffered a complete mental breakdown , during - get this - during an exorcism .
not what the records show . anyway , she was a runaway , arrests for vandalism , petty theft , drugs , the whole bit . parole records show she graduated from community college , moved into a retreat house , teaches some classes at the seminary school , has n't been in any trouble since .
she told me she killed them .
mother killed the father , then killed herself . crime of passion .
what happened ?
yeah , murder-suicide .
parents died ?
she 's got a juvenile record from new orleans . parents died when she was 13 .
she came to me with a wild story about demonic possession .
you got the right attitude , anyway , look , we got ta talk .
it 's another day . i think i 'm alright .
how 're you doin ' today ?
what 's up ?
hey , do n't thank me . somebody up there likes you .
thanks again for everything .
sure thing . look , i 've got enough , between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts . you can go home . gim me til morning . find out who he is . until then , do n't sweat it , huh ? just your random bad cheese trying to hole you .
thanks for handling this .
i 'll quit , maybe you should start .
he could see me .
he 's looking right at me .
what 's the matter with you ?
you 're too old to smoke . wo n't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid .
yeah , look at that sweet face . you 'd never guess he killed nine people . i 'm gon na get my smokes . be right back .
seems george is n't making too many friends in lockup .
so you can see where you 're going when you crawl up his asshole .
what 's this ?
yeah , yeah . i 've heard it before . just be sure you spell my name right . nine o'clock ?
really ? you know , seeing these guys away from the court , the facade slips . you catch things .
so , viznick 's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem .
yeah , right . i do n't know why i bothered inviting you guys . i knew you would n't show .
mike . oh , the christening . i meant to call ...
hey ! mr. big shot .
when i said quincy could do better , i was thinking about you .
what are you talking about ?
it mattered , mom .
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff . it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games .
that 's all you cared about . i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two .
what 's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman 's home cooking and ironing his drawers .
that 's ridiculous .
i do . you never stood up for yourself . ever . if i was ashamed , it was because of that .
i do n't remember that .
i remember when i was eight years old , you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal . all you 'd let me and lena do was set the table . and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas . and you did n't say anything . you just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge .
do n't tell me you are n't ashamed of that because i know .
that 's not it .
oh , yes . the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife .
i 'm angry because i want a mother , not martha stewart .
so you 're angry with me because you 're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume ?
because you 're pushing me to be something i 'm not .
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you ?
i was n't lena . i did n't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume .
child , please . ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say .
no i do n't .
you 're the one always turning your nose up at me .
so that 's why we ca n't get along ? because i 'd rather shoot a `` dumb '' jump shot ?
what do you want me to tell you , monica , to go beat that girl up ? to go have sex with him ? i 'm not going to do that . yes , i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i 'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot . if that makes me too `` prissy '' for you , too bad .
there you go .
do n't curse .
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy .
you did n't want my opinion in the first place , so why even ask ?
whatever .
find out where they 're registered and send them a gift .
so what do i do ?
maybe she is .
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago . he could do a lot better if you ask me .
yeah , you met her ?
to that stewardess ?
engaged .
how is he ?
yeah . ca n't wait to see him i just saw quincy .
i can manage .
need any help ?
hi .
whenever you lose , you get this attitude . but it 's just a game .
what ?
he 's still at the bank .
dad around ?
do n't be defensive . i 'm just surprised to see you .
did n't know i needed a reason to come home .
monica . what are you doing here ?
tonight , do n't worry about yesterday 's game , the recruiters , or anything else . i just want you to enjoy being beautiful . will you do that ?
what ?
nothing . so good luck .
what ?
sure . in between all the other things i have to do .
you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say .
child , take a bite .
i ca n't eat before a game .
taste this .
watch your mouth .
well , that 's what you think , is n't it ? cause i 'd rather wear a jersey than an apron ...
that 's not funny
i wo n't . i 'm a lesbian .
i do n't know why i keep hoping you 'll grow out of this tomboy thing .
nothing .
pants .
fine , you do n't like this one , which one would you rather wear ?
i hate it .
i 'm lucky i found it . someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage .
ah , mom .
oh , all that work .
nothing .
monica , what did you do ?
thanks , sweetheart .
okay .
you sure ?
the blue .
which one for tomorrow ?
camille , she 'll be fine .
how is she alright looking the way she does ?
she 's alright .
she needs to stop running around like a little boy .
okay .
he 's fine .
you might want to put a jacket on him , it 's getting cold .
the doctor said it was okay . anyway , i 'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat .
so you 're still breast-feeding ?
what 'd you do ?
so that means it 's alright for you to act like that ?
but you use potato ?
... and if you want a thicker base , you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour .
i just need to lay down . i 've been running around all day .
are you okay ?
when you 're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth ?
really ? well , come on , then .
you know , girl , long as i 've lived next door , i 've never seen the inside of this house .
well , no , but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older , it 's definitely something i want to do . since you love to cook , maybe it 's something we can talk about .
you 're a caterer ?
oh , me too . i used to cook for my friends ' parties and things back in atlanta .
it was the least we could do . and i love to cook .
well , thanks again . this was really nice of you .
okay ?
until the black family down the street became the black family next door .
... we moved back here when quincy was about five , after zeke was traded . neighborhood was a little more mixed back then ...
you think i 'd go hoarse for a player with no potential ? when i ignore you , that 's when you worry . go get dressed .
it 's just ... it seems like you 're always yelling at me .
what ?
you want the job or not ?
i thought sidra 's ankle was okay for next game .
we 've got our final games against oregon and oregon state and i want to shake things up a bit , so i 'm starting you at point again .
thanks .
you could 've given up after you threw that ball away . but you kept your head and you showed real heart .
i want you to stand like that until you 're sick of it because i do n't ever want to see it again , you hear me ? dora , take her spot .
coach ...
you love to pose so much , let 's see it again .
what ?
this time get your feet set .
i can take it .
shh . it 's okay .
wait ...
your sister told me hands off , but i ca n't help myself ...
uh-huh .
that was nice .
then i 'll get you some punch .
my mouth is kinda dry .
i mean , i 'm having a good time with you ...
sorry .
that was two words .
huh ?
careful .
sort of .
i 'm an english major . you like english ?
oh , sorry .
no , i mean i can check it for you .
you 're cold ?
can i take your coat ?
i 'd love for him to get a good education . that 's it .
but you 'd love for him to play at usc , like you did .
got ta wait til the press conference .
you could make a career by telling me where .
do n't go starting rumors , jim . my son 's college bound with or without basketball .
quincy , word has it you might make the jump the nba .
do n't make fun of me when i 'm being wonderful and supportive . you belong on the court . just like i belong in the stands , looking cute and cheering you on .
a horse ?
you 're just scared . i know rehab is hard , and you have to worry about whether you 'll be as good as you were but you will be . i believe in you . you just have to get back on the court . like you 'd get back on a horse .
i do n't know sometimes .
to do what you love .
sometimes i wonder if it 's worth it . busting my ass , for what ?
baby , do n't talk like that . your rehab 's going well . you 'll be back before you know it .
you might be the only one with a job .
why not ?
nah .
four days .
so how long is this trip ?
get used to it , babe .
i do n't wan na see that .
what ?
damn , girl .
yes , we appreciate that .
it means a lot that you came by .
monica . you grew up together , right ? quincy 's told me about you .
kyra , this is monica . she , uh ...
hello .
why are you up ? get in bed .
it 's okay .
i 'm so sorry . no one would switch flights with me .
yeah , once i cut them off . why ?
they ever love you back ?
too many times .
you ever been in love ?
hey . you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight . let me worry about your date .
i do n't know how to walk in heels .
if you were tore up i would not be claiming you . trust .
yeah , right .
you do .
oh , great .
i told him you looked like me .
how 'd you get him to say yes ?
and he 's fine , girl .
he 's in college ?
this brother from my college .
damn , lena ... who is he ?
no .
mom tell you to do this ?
i know ...
found ? i 'm not some charity case .
i found you someone .
yeah , brothers are lined up at my locker .
so what 's going on with the spring dance ? you have a date yet ?
just try and chill a little bit , alright .
no one 's forcing her .
you need to . she 's alone in this house all day , taking care of dad and your ungrateful behind .
just cause i do n't kiss her booty like you ...
like you do n't give her a hard time .
always on my ass , anyway .
mom 's going to hate it .
no .
that too tight ?
i 'll take that as a compliment .
you shoot like a girl .
so how 's the job going ?
that tends to happen when you 're the boss 's daughter .
i was upstairs for a meeting . i 've been hearing good things about you .
dad . what are you doing here ?
hey , munchkin .
chances are there 's still a chance .
i know . but chances are ...
the coach from usc is going to be at the championship .
you only have one game left and you have n't been recruited . munchkin , i wanted it as bad as you did , but we have to face reality .
what ?
monica , i think her point is ... maybe it 's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball .
i was just showing emotion .
you lost your head .
the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench .
and what am i supposed to say to the man ?
dad , you have to talk to coach for me .
sometimes . but what 's the alternative , not playing ? you remember big toni ? she quit last year , now she 's working at some bookstore . i mean , look at us . they treat us like we 're hollywood stars over here . we just played in the championship game . it does n't get much sweeter than this .
you ever think about going back ?
shoot , italian boys love them some black women . they ca n't get enough of me .
just not my type , i guess .
what ? you 've been over here seven months and you ai n't tapped anything ?
i would n't know .
so what are these spanish guys like ?
it 's better . even though the whole first season my teammates did n't pass to me cause they were mad `` the american '' was making more money . i led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way i could touch the damn ball .
how 's that been ?
yup . so i 've been playing with this italian club the last three years .
just like that ?
yeah , four years ago . they had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people . i 'm not playing , there was about a thousand goats running around , and it gets dark at four o'clock . then the whack club i 'm on loses three games in a row and i get blamed . so they fire me .
you mean my championship trophy ? my bad .
can you take that damn thing off the table .
how do you say `` you 're dreaming '' in italian ?
i 'm gon na love winning this championship in your house .
what 's up , sidra .
well , what do you know .
never let a freshman take your spot .
what 's that ?
just one word of advice for next season .
i know .
but that was a dumb-ass pass to toni . ten seconds left , you run out the clock .
thanks .
no buts . took a lot of heart to take that charge .
but ?
just wanted to say good game .
what 's up ?
did n't have to try very hard .
you were trying to make me look bad .
i was just playing ball .
that 's what you get for trying to show out , freshman .
besides . i 've been starting point the last two years . ai n't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot .
thanks , sidra .
hey , do n't take it personal . and do n't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other . we 're teammates , okay ?
what 's up with that ?
she hates all freshmen .
coach hates me , does n't she ?
if i lose , i 'll buy you a wedding present .
and what happens when you lose ?
so , if i win it 's because deep down you know you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life , and deep down your want me to stop you .
so ?
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to .
what will this prove ?
monica , after that stuff with my dad , i could n't trust anybody , okay . i mean , i was lost . so you are forgiven . but that was five years ago . i moved on .
i know why you broke up with me in college . and not that what you did was n't messed up , but what i did was , too . so if you forgive me , i 'll forgive you .
what 's that supposed to be , psychology ?
so you 're gon na bitch up ?
you 're out of your mind .
your heart .
for what ?
one game . one-on-one .
what ?
i 'll play you .
wrong .
better late than never , right ?
because you do n't pull this on someone who 's about to get married .
then why are you so upset ?
you have n't changed . you still think the sun rises and sets on your ass . well , guess what , it does n't .
i know , i probably should have said it two weeks ago .
we have n't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this ?
what i 'm trying to say is , i 've loved you since i was eleven and the shit wo n't go away .
i heard enough .
it 's not fun for me anymore because you 're missing .
you woke me up to tell me that ?
from basketball .
what ?
you asked me what was missing .
we need to talk .
what 's going on ?
find .
it does n't matter , alright . just leave it alone .
what ?
something was just missing .
cause i do n't get it .
why do you keep asking me that ?
so why 'd you give up ball ?
it 's a trip , you know ? when you 're a kid , you see the life you want , and it never crosses your mind that it 's not gon na turn out that way .
i mean , kyra has n't heard the school thing yet . she 'll probably say it 's the painkillers talking .
wow .
maybe go back to school .
like what ?
seems like i needed a ball when i was trying to be like my pops ... or trying to be better than him . now , i kinda think i need to try something else .
you 're serious .
nah . i have n't dribbled a ball in four and a half months . maybe i miss some of the attention , but besides that ...
and you tore up your knee . rehab is tough .
that a nice way of saying i rode the bench ?
you had a rough couple years , that 's all .
because i 'm kinda feeling that way , too .
it just is n't .
that 's okay . i 'm probably , you know , busy .
yeah . two weeks . i did n't get to send you an invitation , but if you ...
strong enough to get you down the aisle ?
getting there .
so ... how 's the knee ?
darryl . he 's alright , kinda corny .
who 's this guy i always see her around ?
kyra 's gone for a couple days . figured i 'd keep mom company .
you visiting ?
thanks .
yeah , and quincy , good luck with your knee , and everything .
no .
yeah . basketball just , is n't fun anymore . you know ?
a rest ?
i 'm tired of playing overseas . thinking about giving it a rest for awhile .
what do you mean ?
actually , i do n't ...
figured it was something like that .
must have been my cheap-ass answering machine . it was always messing up .
wanted to give you props on making first team all-american . and then when magic retired , i tried calling you again .
oh yeah ?
tried calling you a couple times .
kiss my ass .
funny . i never did .
well , i tried sneaking in after college , but they found breasts during my physical .
still working on being the first girl in the nba ?
we won the championship .
so , how 's pro-ball , europe ?
i forgot , `` q-man . ''
not for quincy mccall .
i thought a torn acl was ten to twelve .
a lot of things . all i know is i 'll be back in six months .
what are the doctors saying ?
yup .
i 'm fine . my dad said you tore your acl .
i 'm alright . but you can sit .
should n't you be lying down , or ...
thanks .
no , it looks good . i mean , it 's cool .
just something i 'm trying .
i was . i see your peach fuzz finally grew in .
alright . i heard you were in spain .
uh huh .
so ... i guess i 'll see you around .
damnitt , monica . this ai n't about us anymore , it 's about me .
so that 's it , just forget about us ?
few days ago .
when did you decide all this ?
i decided to go pro . and who knows where i 'll end up , you know ?
you 're what ?
look , i 'm entering the draft .
you do n't think so ?
i do n't think so .
how are you going to tell me what i have time for ? i mean , whatever i did ... we can fix this .
i 'm going through a lot of shit right now , more than you have time for .
what ?
i 'm not asking for us to be together .
how do i know next time you 're feeling neglected or whatever , you 're not going to run around on me ? if we 're going to be together i have to be able to trust you .
well , if all you care about is basketball , why you fucking me ? go fuck dick vitale .
i 'm a ballplayer . if anyone knows what that means it should be you .
never had to .
i never asked you to choose .
least you got your priorities straight .
if i stayed , i would n't be starting !
stay !
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew . what was i supposed to do ?
you forgot to be there .
what , `` q-man '' , did i forget to kiss your ass like everybody else ?
i just said i did n't fuck around . but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me .
so you fucked around to prove a point !
least she had time for me .
cheap date .
i just took the ho to burger king , alright .
talk to your new girlfriend .
can we talk ?
are you out of your mind ?
we 're going to get some food .
what the hell 's going on ?
oh , kerry , this is monica . monica , kerry .
woman ...
the `` man '' again .
yeah , i hit a three at the buzzer .
yeah , sorry about that . i had this meeting with this guy .
you were n't at my game .
hey , what 's up .
hey .
nah . i have curfew .
fine ... maybe i 'll come by later .
you know what , i 'm just gon na crash .
not really .
you want to go talk ?
look , this party 's whack . you ready to go ?
who 's nobody ?
nobody .
who was that ?
you think for once we could talk about something besides basketball ?
he 's just playing , q ...
it happens , right ...
sorry about your game .
here i am .
i 've been trying to find you all day .
what 's up ?
hey .
for real . i should be alone , anyway .
quincy ...
nah . do n't sweat it .
i mean , i can stay a few more minutes .
did n't realize you were watching the clock .
coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew . if i 'm late , i do n't suit up .
why not ?
i ... ca n't .
i 'm not up for running into anybody . let 's just kick it here , alright ?
nothing . why do n't we walk to my dorm ?
i know a lot of brothers dog their wives , i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this ...
you 're not stupid .
he even had me wanting to play for the `` clippers . '' man , how stupid am i .
she understands .
what has he been to me ? i mean , he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing . like it was easy . and i 'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she 's the one with no sense ...
i know he messed up , but that does n't change what he 's been to you .
do n't put your hands in your pockets , hold your head up , always look a man in the eye , and all the time i 'm hanging on his every word like he 's god or something ...
i wanted you to .
i won .
right here .
yo , where 's the `` d '' ?
plan to .
kiss my booty .
my court , i go first .
give me the ball .
what ?
clothes .
what are we playing for ?
so how about a little one-on-one ?
who cares if you 're never known as the first girl in the nba . you 'll get more play behind quincy mccall 's woman anyway .
that was so weak .
so you 're gon na act salty all night ?
i do n't have it easy like you , alright . there 's no red carpet laid out for me .
then prove her wrong .
i 'm telling you , coach wishes she was here instead of me .
forget tonya randall .
quit .
it 's okay , little baby .
i said fine .
i ca n't help girls coming up to me .
fine , quincy .
i ca n't be nice to a fan ?
you do see me standing here , right ?
what ?
whatever , big head .
basically broke down how i 'm gon na make mad loot in the nba , me being such a limited commodity and all .
what 'd it say ?
yeah .
you finish the reading for e-con ?
i know , right ?
what was that about ?
you sure ?
it was on my bed when i came in . can you just ... ?
when 'd you get this ?
you had four offensive rebounds .
what ?
four .
cause i do n't just stick my dick in anything .
why ?
that what you think ?
well , i 'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied .
none of your business .
so what dead-end street did you and shawnee hit ?
figures .
mulholland drive .
i was about to ask you the same thing , going out with a college boy and all .
early night for you , is n't it ?
so you took shawnee , huh ?
guess not .
he ai n't spalding .
yeah , the dj 's kinda whack , though . so who is this clown ?
yeah .
you having fun ?
hey .
hey .
you either .
you do n't look half-bad .
yeah .
see you made it .
good .
i do n't .
did n't know you cared so much .
with a jacked-up attitude .
please , you jump in some guy 's face , talk smack and you get a pat on your ass . but because i 'm a female , i get told to calm down and act like a `` lady '' . i 'm a ballplayer , okay . a ball player .
i 'm warning you . you do n't stall that bad attitude , no one 's gon na recruit you .
i 'm warning you , do n't tempt me .
i mean it , give it your best shot , cause i 'm tired of you holding that over my head .
would you watch the damn road ?
that 's it , give it your best shot .
when we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose .
god , here we go .
i 'm not the one who put this scar here .
your hot-ass temper .
who said i 'm not getting recruited ?
see , that 's why you ai n't getting recruited .
who 's spalding ?
so who you going to the dance with , spalding ?
i do n't .
did n't know you cared so much .
yeah , an honest tramp-ass ho . but i guess you 'll stick your dick in anything .
so she 's honest .
and ? she 's not saying , `` i think you 're a nice guy and i wan na get to know you better , '' she 's saying , `` i wan na bone . ''
and ?
she 's a ho cause she 's sending her coochie through the mail .
why she got ta be a ho , just cause she wants to get with me .
big-ass titties ?
some note shawnee easton told me to give to you .
what 's that ?
please .
guess `` please '' would be a stretch .
look , big head , i 'll be at your car .
your legs do n't look broke .
a ride home .
i know this . what do you want ?
way to hoop .
shut up !
last time they won , dr. j. was a nurse .
what ?
you 're stupid . and your daddy plays for the worst team in the nba .
man , forget you then , stupid .
i do n't have to do what you say .
so that means i have to ride with you .
so ?
my dad always drives my mom .
i want to ride my own bike .
five seconds .
for how long ?
i think we got ta kiss now .
okay .
kay .
how bout twinkies ? my mom wo n't ever buy them .
oh .
i do n't like flowers .
i guess , you know , we play ball and we ride to school together . and if you get mad at me , i got ta give you flowers .
what do i have to do ?
she do n't know how to box , i bet . my dad showed me how to fight like ali .
i 'd just tell my sister , lena .
well , if anybody bothers you , you could just tell me cause i run this street .
i do n't care .
you do act different .
one time magic scored forty-eight points , and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth .
i do n't know . a lot .
what was the most points your daddy ever got in junior high ?
he 's alright , but my dad can take him .
i 'm going to be number thirty-two , like magic .
my dad plays for the `` clippers . '' he says i'ma be a doctor or a lawyer , but i'ma play for them , too . same number and everything .
he works at a bank .
your dad play ?
my mom says she does n't know where i come from 'cause i act different .
i never knew a girl that could play .
i just can .
so how come you could play basketball ?
uh huh .
for real ?
it 's this big hole . you could almost see bone .
so ... does it hurt ?
i'ma be in the nba . you 're gon na be my cheerleader .
told you i was nice . i 'm going to be the first girl in the nba .
lucky .
one , up .
i do n't wan na look fast . thanks , girl .
give it yourself .
well , can you give him this for me ?
there 's so many i just ca n't keep track .
c'mon , girl , you live next door . who 's been creeping ?
no .
your hair looks so cute like that .
hey .
hey , girl .
happy . and he wo n't want to see you .
almost did n't recognize you with your hair like that . how you been ?
he tore his acl .
nona , please .
the doctor 'll be back in a minute .
what 's that , not great ?
not great .
keep your voice down .
fine , then how many nights home is that ?
no , you said i should get my degree . i like my `` bullshit '' job , okay , and it 's gon na lead to a spot in the front office . til then , do n't worry , there 's just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold .
you said you 'd think about going back to get your degree .
i have .
i 'm just saying it 'd be nice if you found time for your family . you should see the tramps coming after quincy . if you do n't talk to him ...
yeah .
i came second to the nba . i 'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job .
i 'm not gon na get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife does n't get an attitude .
at one in the morning ?
i had some players to see and hands to shake .
nona , do n't start bitching . i got maybe two years left to play . i 'm just trying to put some things together for us .
you just got back from a four game road trip .
business folks .
with who ?
just you and quincy , baby . i got a meeting .
we should head over .
what ? oh , and , uh , do n't say `` shit . ''
zeke .
so you 're gon na take the word of some trick over pop 's ? he would n't lie .
guess i should have been telling your father .
i mean , how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho 's ?
quincy , please ...
this is just about money , you know that .
just ... leave it alone .
mom , we ca n't let something like this mess up the family .
whose truth are you talking about ?
do n't sweat it , okay . sooner or later the truth 'll come out .
guess he talked to you .
i 'm fine .
sorry . you okay ?
you scared me .
i do n't know , he had a meeting or something .
later when ?
said he 'd be home later .
where 's your dad ?
yup .
still the man .
twenty-seven points , eleven assists and still undefeated .
how was your game ?
i 've been hearing you .
you hearing me ?
okay .
i 'm not playing with you , these girls are looking to get you caught . they see you , they see dollar signs .
we were just studying .
quincy , i told you about these fat-ass girls .
what are you doing in my room ?
i look like some hoochie to you ? i found it on your floor .
uh , your earring ?
what is this ?
yeah .
we still have to go ?
what ?
fine , i 'll fuck off , but not til i say something .
yeah .
you want me to fuck off ?
and now i 'm paying for it , right ? that what this is about ? `` i told you so ? ''
quincy . i know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me .
good .
no .
i stopped taking your advice a long time ago , or did you forget ?
i can see that . i know things look pretty bleak right now , but you ca n't get down on yourself .
look , i 'm busy .
do n't remember that being my fault . seems like you divorced me same time as your mom .
after five years .
came by to check on you .
what do you want ?
always thought `` ca n't '' was n't in a man 's vocabulary .
i know your mad at me , okay , but i ca n't let you do this .
from your mouth .
what ?
since we 're being honest , guess i should tell you . i 'm dropping out of school and going pro .
i 'm saying i handled my responsibilities like a man . but when you 're in the nba , you pull into a city and there 's a hundred women waiting at the hotel . and another twenty that made it past security on your floor . and the boldest one is standing right at your door . and after awhile , it just becomes part of the game . i 'm sorry i lied to you , i should n't have . but i did it cause i love you .
so now you 're saying my mother trapped you ?
your mom was real quick to show you those pictures , was n't she ? well , she was nineteen when she got pregnant and do n't get me wrong , you 're the best thing in my life , but she knew i was n't ready for no marriage .
i ai n't a damn liar .
boy , you 're so perfect you can look down on me ?
and some things should never fucking happen !
look , i ai n't saying it was right , but sometimes things happen .
lucky kid .
i messed up , okay , i know that . but i ai n't that kid 's father .
we ai n't got nothing to talk about .
we need to talk .
still is , so let yourself out .
your door was unlocked .
what are you doing here ?
we have n't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years . something like this happens , it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart . we 'll just have to see how it plays out . i 'm giving her some space , couple days ...
what 's mom think ?
a case like this could hang around for months and i 'm up for this player relations job with the `` clips . '' this gets out , false or not , no one 'll touch me .
why ?
i want this thing to go to court , but my lawyer 's telling me to settle .
so what are you gon na do ?
no , you need to hear me say it , i 'll say it . it 's not true .
sorry .
i mean , it 's not true , is it ?
i just told you .
tell me what ?
some girl that 's been hanging on at every party . now i 'm supposed to be her baby 's daddy . anyway , i told your mom i wanted to be the one who told you .
what ?
there 's this thing out there . this paternity suit .
what mess ?
besides , the sooner you go pro , the sooner you 'll have to deal with the mess i 'm dealing with .
okay ...
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices . you do n't have a choice .
you came out early .
you know how much higher the play level is in the nba ? give yourself time to develop , quincy . get an education . the nba ai n't going nowhere .
i 'm also good enough to go pro .
well , tell them to mind their damn business . you 're smart enough to get a degree .
you know , people .
what people ?
let 's hope i can say the same about you one day .
you work too hard , pop .
anyway , i got ta get to this meeting . tell your mom i 'm gon na be late .
you do n't wan na hurt your back .
i do n't wan na hurt your feelings .
yeah ? so you up for a game later ?
did n't we already have this conversation ?
i do n't care about the team . i care about the school .
pop , there 's no way an ivy league team is going all the way .
that 's right .
cause when you say ca n't , you ai n't a man .
why not ?
`` ca n't '' should never be in a man 's vocabulary .
boy , what 'd i tell you about using that word ?
hey fuck you don watch it now .
that 's none of your bussiness . i have been a good worker , a good and loyal worker for you , you fucking asshole .
no need for braces , donnie .
i do n't know .
how are you paying tor the braces , donnie ?
i ca n't believe you 're gon na do this to me , the situation i 'm in , i do n't -- avi : you know what ? being hit by lighting does n't matter for getting braces , ok ? now solomon , let me just ask you once : please . please . do n't do this .
don , you got hit by lightning that time in tahoe , you went on vacation , i do n't think braces is a good idea --
i need corrective oral surgery . i need the braces .

that was so great what you just said .
i 'm sorry --
oh my god , jim . jim , that was so --
i lost my gun after i left you today and i 'm the laughing stock of a lot of people . i wanted to tell you that . i wanted you to know ... and it 's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and i feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things , that we should say what we 're thinknig and not lie about things and i 'll tell you that , this : that i lost my gun and i 'm not a good cop ... and i 'm looked down at ... and i know that ... .and i 'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me .
what ?
i lost my gun .
you 're a police officer . you have so much , so many good things and you seem so together ... so all straight and put together without problems .
-- no , like what , what do you mean ?
i 'm really nervous that you 're gon na hate me soon . that you 're gon na find stuff out about me and you 're gon na hate me --
yeah , of course .
can i tell you something ?
yeah .
that felt good to do ... to do what i wanted to do .
well .
ok .
ok .
i 'm gon na run to the bathroom for a minute ... maybe just --
i 'm sorry .
-- well i 'm a real ... y'know , straight when it comes to that ... curse words i just do n't use much --
no , i 'm sorry . i 'm saying i 'm sorry . i talk like a jerk sometimes --
... nothing . i 'm sorry ...
i 'm sorry .
it 's fine .
i did n't mean ... it 's seems vulgar or something , i know --
-- no , no , it 's fine . fine .
i 'm sorry --
you really use strong language .
what ?
wow ... .huh ... '' ... piss and shit ... ''
ok. i 'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people ... .
let 's make a deal .
to not do that . to not do that that we 've maybe done -- before --
... yeah ...
what i just said ... y'know , people afraid to say things ... .no guts to say the things that they ... that are real or something ...
ok .
you wan na make a deal with me ?
no , no .
and i bet you say that to all the girls --
i 've never found someone really that i think i would like to go out with .
why not ?
well i do n't go out very much .
so you 've done it --
well , that 's a natural thing , two people go out on a date , something . they want to impress people , the other person ... or they 're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
did you ever go out with someone and just ... .lie ... .question after question , maybe you 're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever , or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie , but maybe you just do n't say everything --
bye .
great , bye .
oh , see ? this is great . ten o'clock .
it 's my favorite place --
yeah , you know it ? you know billingsley 's ?
billingsley 's ?
no , no , just casual maybe , maybe i thought -- there 's a spot i like to go , it 's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
oh sure yes , that 's fine , late dinners are good . should i get dressed up or -- ?
what about ten o'clock , is that too late ? i do n't get off and then --
eight o'clock ?
no , i 'm off tonight . i would lov-like , to go tonight , i can pick you up , i can pick you up here at about what time ? what time ?
do you wan na go tonight ? i mean , are you working ?
i thought you were flirting with me a little .
yeah .
really ?
i do n't know . i have n't thought about it -- you know what -- that 's not true -- i have thought about it . i 've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door .
then ... i 'd like to go ... what do you want to do ?
no .
well ... is that illegal ?
please , yes .
you wan na go on a date with me ?
no , no . i was wondering ... man oh man . i think i feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this , considering that i came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but i think i 'd be a fool if i did n't do something i really want to do which is to ask you on a date .
what is it ? did you forget something ?
i 'm sorry , claudia .
good bye .
bye , bye , claudia .
yeah , good , ok .
just jim .
yes . i will . it was nice to meet you officer jim .
ok , then . keep your chin up and your music down , alright ?
i 'm sorry .
no . no . do n't joke about that . that 's not funny , claudia . please , now .
if you 're not here for a 422 --
well if you listen ' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we 'll share another cup of coffee --
we were just gettin ' warmed up . we were just getting started .
this is my job .
tempural-something-mandibular , thing with something , i dunno . but it affects my ear , i do n't even know if i have tmj exactly but just very tight , like - it 's like a muscle spasm and it 's just gets so clenched --
what 's that stand for ?
-- - yeah , yeah , i get in it in my ear . it 's tmj is what it 's called technically .
thank you .
this is , for not a fresh cup , a great cup of coffee , claudia --
ok , ok. i 'm back .
okey-doke .
i 'm gon na run to the bathroom real quick .
but i would n't mind comin ' back in an hour just to see your pretty face !
you wo n't . you wo n't have to .
i do n't wan na have to come back here in an hour and find that there 's been another disturbance .
it 's not my boyfriend -- and it 's not anything -- it 's over . really . it 's not . he wo n't came back .
it 's where situations like these lead , claudia , unless you do something about it early , if and when the police call and come for help . now there are certain measures you can take --
it 's not -- what 's a 422 ?
many times , in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak , but i have to tell you that , being a police officer , i 've seen it happen : young woman afraid to speak , next thing you know , i 'm gettin ' a call on the radio , i got a 422 --
-- is not my boyfriend .
the gentleman who came to the door --
i do n't have a boyfriend .
is this boyfriend bothering you ?
arlight , then . cheers .
yeah .
that 'd be fine . so , claudia , lem me just say , so i can get my role of lapd officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee i 'm not gon na write you up or anything , i 'm not gon na give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here , people that work from their homes , people tryin ' to get some work done , and if you 're listenin ' to your music that loud : they 're incovenienced by that . if you had a job you 'd probably understand , but i see you like listenin ' to your music and that 's fine , you 're just gon na wan na keep it down at a certain volume , maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- if it 's the middle of the day -- that 's what i do -- just put it on two and a half and that 's a good listening level , alright ? i see you like listenin ' to your music loud , but , hey , forget about the neighbors , you end up damaging your own ears ok ?
you take cream or sugar ?
oh , it 'll be fine , i 'm sure , claudia .
i do n't know how fresh it 's gon na be --
that 's great , thank you .
-- do you wan na cup ?
i like iced coffee , generally , but a day like this , rain and what not , i enjoy a warm cup --
yeah ... it 's not ... it 's been on for a bit --
got some coffee brewing , huh ?
i do n't have a boyfriend .
you and your boyfriend have a party last night ?
yeah .
i 'm a bit of a slob myself .
yeah .
bit messy .
about two years ago .
you just move in here ?
ok .
claudia : why do n't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers , ok ?
what are you lookin ' for ?
it 's fine .
you mind if i check things back here ?
i was ... he 's gone ... i mean it 's not . it 's over , y'know --
who was it ?
no .
you do n't have a boyfriend ?
no .
was it a boyfriend of yours ?
yes . i had someone come to my door , someone i did n't want here and i told them to leave -- so -- it 's no big deal . they left . i 'm sorry .
i got a call of a disturbance , screaming and yelling , loud music . has there been some screaming and yelling ?
no .
you got the tv on too , keep those on at that same time usually ?
yeah .
and that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum , you understand ?
i did n't realize it was that loud .
well if you keep listenin ' to the music that loud you 're not only gon na damage your ears but your neighbors ears .
no .
-- listenin ' to that music so loud : you tryin ' to damage your ears ?
yeah , but i do n't know --
did you hear what i said ?
what ?
ok. claudia wilson : you tryin ' to go deaf ?
wilson .
i 'm sorry .
ok. for one thing , we 're gon na need to turn that music down so we can talk , ok ?

`` if a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh ? '' `` well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick , equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds -- '' `` a little more than kin and less than kind , '' is hamlet to claudius . `` the sins of the father laid upon the children , '' is merchant of venice but borrowed from exodus 20:5 and `` win her with gifts if she respects not words , '' is two gentleman from verona . where ? who ? how and why , kids ?
shall we drink to that ?
i used to be smart but now i 'm just stupid .
this sounds sad as a weeping willow .
yes they do , they do , but i 'll make my dreams come true , you see ? i will .
things go round 'n round , do n't they ?
-- and lem me tell you this : samuel johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money ? his parents ? his mommy and daddy ? make him live this life like this -- `` a man of genius '' gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting ? it hurts and it does n't happen to everyone , it 's an electrical charge that finds it 's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for `` ruined but by himself , '' not if his parents take his friggin ' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you do n't ? well , what --
picky , picky .
`` the '' cause of dullness in others --
it was the lovely samuel johnson who also spoke of a fella `` who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others . ''
-- samuel johnson .
who was it that said : `` a man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself . ''

the job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible . right ? you understand ?
-- how the fuck can i say anything to that -- i do n't know what to say to that --
this is the number for hospice . ok. now . as far as the morphine pills go , there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in , there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine ... .it 's a little bottle , with an eye dropper and it 's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him ; there really is no coming back , i mean , it will certainly cure his pain , but he will float in and out of consciousness , even worse than he is now , linda . i mean , any sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away --
ok. linda : earl is not gon na make it . he 's dying . he is . he is dying very , very rapidly --
i need to sit down .
do you wan na sit down ?
i 'm listening . i 'm getting better .
we can fix that , because i can give you -- are you listening ?
-- you do n't understand : it 's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills are n't working , he 's -- past two days it 's like he ca n't really swallow them and i do n't know if they 're going down -- i ca n't see inside his mouth anymore -- i 'm up all night staring at him and i do n't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
if you 're happy with phil taking care of him and helping you , that 's fine , but contact hospice to arrange for the body --
yeah .
phil 's one of the nurses from the service ?
he has phil right now .
well that 's what hospice will take care of for you . they will send a nurse , someone who can take care of all of that for you --
i just , i just -- i just -- i 'm just in a fucking state , i know he 's going and it 's like i do n't know how -- just tell me < u > practical < /u > things -- what the fuck do i do with his body ? what happens when he dies ? that next moment : what ? what do i do ? then what ?
i can help you through this the best i know how but there are certain things you are gon na have to be strong about and take care of , now we can go over them , but i need to know that you 're listening to me , ok ?
-- he 's fucking dying , he 's dying as we 're sitting here and there is n't a fucking thing -- jesus , how can you tell me to calm down ?

i 'm looking for frank mackey .
i think you have the wrong number .
hi . is frank there ?
hello ?
-- fuck you .
you 're hurting a lot of people , frank --
you requested my time and i gave it you , you called me a liar and made accusations . and you say , `` if i 'd known i would n't have asked , '' then it 's not an attack ? well , i do n't wan na be the sort of fella who does n't keep his word . i gave you my time , bitch . so fuck you now .
so you sat it out , that 's what you did ?
time 's up . thank you for the interview .
i 'm quietly judging you .
yeah .
what am i doing ?
c'mon , frank . what are you doing ?
i talked to miss simms . miss simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980 .
and that 's what you 've heard ?
i was told that your mother died . that your mother died when you were young --
go ahead and waste your time .
no , this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
an old stomping ground -- is this the `` attack '' portion of the interview , i figured this was coming sooner or later -- is `` the girl '' coming in for the kill ?
she lived in tarzana .
mm . hm .
she does . from when you were a boy .
i know alotta women and i 'm sure she remembers me .
do you remember a miss simms ?
i 'm not sure i hear a question in there ?
we talked earlier about your mother . and we talked about your father and his death . and i do n't want to be challenging or defeatist here , but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something -- something that i understand --
this is how you wan na spend the time , then go , go , go -- you 're gon na be surprised at what a waste it is -- `` the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me , '' chapter three --
it 's not like i 'm trying to attack you --
not really .
it 's all important --
-- there 's a lot more important things i 'd like to put myself < u > into < /u > --
i 'm saying , frank , in trying to figure out who you are --
in aid of what ?
well , just trying to figure out who you are , and how you might have become --
yes .
are you asking me that ?
-- and i try and teach the students to ask : what is it in aid of ?
this is n't meant --
thank you , muffy . funny thing is : this is an important element of , `` seduce and destory : '' `` facing the past is an important way in not making progress , '' that 's something i tell my men over and over --
i would just want to clear some things up :
so boring , so useless --
-- just to clarify --
is that still lingering ?
i 'm confused about your past is the thing .
muffy -- coffee ?
-- let 's talk more about your background --
i warned you -- i get on a roll ...
it 's fine . i can bleep it out .
i just realized this is for television , is n't it ? i ca n't swear up and down like i just did .
let 's talk about --
-- that 's right , that 's right , and what i 'm saying , that none of my competitors can say is this : that there is no need for insight or understanding . things of the past ! gone , over , done . do you realize how fucking miraculous this is ? how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it 's time this concept is ? i 'm talking about eliminating < u > insight < /u > and < u > understanding < /u > as human values . god damn i 'm good . there is no need for insight . there is no need for understanding . i have found a way to take < u > any < /u > subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you 've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language . the `` listener-patient '' settles into a very light , very delicate , conversationally induced state : not a trance , mind you , but a state . a state that is brand new . the system 's state . what did i do ? i realized that concept and put it into practical `` get my dick hard and fuck it '' use . i 'm gon na build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live , vote , breath , pay takes and party 'till dawn . i 'm gon na teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass , tit and tail --
like i said , yeah --
-- see , i thought you grew up here in the valley --
ok. so , lem me just ask you a couple questions to start --
-- go , go , go . i 'm givin ' pearls here . and i'ii tell you samethin ' else : i 'm not succeding in the bush because i 'm frank tj mackey . if anything , there are women out there that want to < u > destroy < /u > me -- it makes it twice as hard for me , i run into some little muffin , knows who i am , knows my schemes and plans -- shit , she 's gon na wan na fuck around , prove to her friends , say , `` yaddda-yadda-yadda , i saw that guy , he was n't anything , did n't get me . '' so me ? i 'm runnin ' on full throttle the whole fuckin ' time . dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties . but i'ii tell you this : the battle of the bush is being fought and won by team mackey . can i have a cigarette ?
i 'm gon na start rolling --
just one look , one hesitation , one subtle gesture for me to know -- and bing-bam-boom i 'm away on a tangent -- i get so fuckin ' amped at these seminars and lem me tell you why : because i am what i believe . i am what i teach , i do as i say , i live by these rules as religiously as i preach them : and you wan na know what ? i 'm gettin ' pussy left , right , up , down , center and sideways .
all it takes is one second ?
you got us a room so quick ?
if you 're up to it , i 've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
are we gon na tape some stuff now ?
that 's fine . it 's nice to meet you .
well i guess the question is this : do you remember miss simms ?
are you asking me a question ?
i would n't want that to be misunderstood : my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was , sadly , unable to afford tuition up there . but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes , and they 're names are : macready , horn and langtree among others . i was completely independent financially , and like i said : one sad sack a shit . so what we 're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that 's what most people respond to in `` seduce , '' and at the end of the day ? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it 's about finding what you can be in this world . defining it . controling it and saying : i will take what is mine . you just happen to get a blow job out of it , then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not ? he.he.he .
kind of .
no , no , no . certainly not . i was n't officialy enrolled , that 's right . was that unclear ?
they would n't ?
oh , yeah . no , no , no . they would n't --
ok. that 's why . i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla . your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
`` frank '' was my mother 's father .
and `` frank ? ''
my mother 's name , actually . good question . you 've done you 're research .
it 's not your given name , right ?
what name ? my name ?
where does that name come from ?
i do n't how much i went -- but i was enrolled . i was such a loser back then . i was -- misguided , pathetic -- i was very fat . not even close to what i am today . not the frank tj mackey you 're eager to talk to because i was swimming in what < u > was < /u > as opposed to i < u > wanted < /u > .
and you went to van nuys high , right ?
in five years ?
... this close ...
do you have your masters ?
right .
psychology major ?
from '84 to '89 .
and you ended up at uc berkely --
not a problem .
i wouldn'tve asked --
people die .
i 'm sorry .
he passed away .
and your father ?
`` go get 'em , honey . ''
what does she say about , `` seduce and destroy . ''
she 's my mother .
are you close ?
she 's retired .
does you mother still work ?
well i guess it does n't .
why does that sound silly ?
my father worked in televison . my mother -- this is gon na sound silly to you -- she was a librarian .
and what did your parents do ?
hollywood , mainly .
the valley ?
around here .
where are you from originally ?
... just wait ... dad ... you want something ... can you say ...
i do n't think , he ca n't ...
i 'm here . i 'm here now . what do you want ? do you want anything ?
yeah .
can you stand ... back ... maybe , i mean ... just a little bit ... in the room is ok , but back from us a little ...
... ok ...
so ... .phil ... .um ... i think i 'm gon na step in and try and see him and say something if he can ... talk ... i mean :
mmm .
it 's interesting .
uh . huh .
when they put me on hold , to talk to you ... they play the tapes . i mean : i 'd seen the commercials and heard about you , but i 'd never heard the tapes ... .
oh yeah .

i 'm really sorry .
uh . huh .

hello ?
when they want us done , they 'll call in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit .
we 're not going out two days before we set the record , it 's not gon na happen .
saucy-saucy .
i 'll get it because i 'm a good actress , richard .
if we beat the record , you might get a call back --
no . but i probably will get a call back .
was it a call back ?
not as much as i used to . ever since we started , i have n't really gone in to school that much because i 've been getting more and more auditions --
do you still have to do homework ?
i do n't wan na do it . why ca n't one of you do it --
you have to go , stanley . you 're the smartest .
no they do n't --
they look pretty smart , i think .
movie of the week . i went up for one this morning with alan thicke and corey haim --
what 's mow ?
commercials , a sitcom , an mow or something .
like what ?
you should get one , i 'm serious , you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
no .
do you have an agent , stanley ?
shut the fuck up .
let me call you a car , linda .
i have to go .
linda --
now you must really shut the fuck up , please . shut the fuck up .
you need to sober up .
shut the fuck up . shut the fuck up .
i 'm trying to help , linda --
shut the fuck up .
linda , you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
this is so over-the-top and fucked-up i can hardly stand it .
-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that 's what will happen .
-- that ca n't happen . earl does n't want him to have the money , the things .
the money would go to frank . the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
what does that mean ?
well . considering that there 's no one else mentioned in the will ... we 'd have to go to the laws of intestacy , which is -- as if someone died without a will --
where will the money go ?
you do n't have to change the will , if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it 's time .
i ca n't .
adultery is n't illegal -- it 's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- linda . linda . calm down .
this is not any fucking medication talking , this is n't -- i do n't know . i do n't know -- can you give me nothing ? you have power of attorney , can you see him , can you , in this final fucking moment , go see him and make sure -- - change the fucking will -- i do n't want any money , i could n't live with myself , this thing i 've done -- i 've fucking done so many bad things -- i fucked around . i fucked around on him , i fucking cheated on him , alan . you 're his lawyer , our laywer , there , i 'm his wife , we are married . i broke the conract of marriage , i fucking cheated on him , many times over , i sucked other men 's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ... .fuck ... . other things i 've done..
what kind of medication are you on right now , linda that 's --
i do n't want him to die , i did n't love him when we met , and i 've done so many bad things to him that he does n't know , things i want to confess to him , but now i do : i love him . i love him so much and i ca n't stand -- he 's going .
no , no ... .no , you see ... i never loved him . i never loved him , earl . when i started , when i met him , i met him and i fucked him and i married him because i wanted his money , do you understand ? i 'm telling you this now ... this i 've never told anyone ... i did n't love him . and now ... .i know i 'm in that will , i know , i was there with him , we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money i'ii get -- i do n't want it -- because i love him so much now ... i 've fallen in love with him now , for real , as he 's dying , and i look at him and he 's about to go , alan , he 's dead ... he 's moments ... i took care of him through this , alan . and what now then ?
you ca n't change his will . only earl can change his will .
-- i have something to tell you . i have to tell you something . i want to change his will , can i change his will ? ... i need to -- -
linda , you 're safe . ok. it 's alright . you 're my friend . you and earl are my clients and what you need to talk about wo n't leave this room , you have something you have to say --
like a shrink , like if i go to see a shrink , i 'm protected , i can say things -- fuck -- i do n't know what i 'm doing --
not exactly , linda . i 'm not sure where you 're going with this --
if i talk to you ... y'know ... if i tell you things ... then you 're a lawyer , right ? you ca n't say things , you ca n't tell anyone , it 's like the privelage , right ? attornery-client , you understand ?
are you on drugs right now ?
no ... i just ... i 'm so fucked up here alan , i do n't know ... there 's so much ... so many things --
you do n't want any water ?
tell him i 'm sorry , ok , yes , you do that , now , i 'm sorry , tell him , for all the things i 've done ... i fucked up and i 'm sorry ... . and i 'm gon na turn away and walk now and not look at him not see my man , my earl , i 'll leave now ... and tell him it 's ok and i 'm ok. the whole thing was ok with me -- and i know .
... .it 's alright ... .
listen ... listen to me now , phil : i 'm sorry , sorry i slapped your face . ... because i do n't know what i 'm doing ... ... i do n't know how to do this , y'know ? you understand ? y'know ? i ... i 'm ... i do things and i fuck up and i fucked up ... .forgive me , ok ? can you just ...
bullshit . bullshit he did n't ask you , he does n't want him , he does n't want to talk to him , so fuck you that he asked that . there is no one but me and him .
earl asked me , linda , please , linda , i 'm sorry -- earl asked me --

it 's ok .
..sorry ...
hi .
hi .
it 's ok .
..sorry ...
hi .
hi .
anne ... the night we had together ... i always wanted more . but that one , it was enough . enough to make me love you forever . i want you to remember that ... and go on . as strong as you are now . no matter what happens .
i could n't tell you . you had enough to carry .
there were two . not one . but two .
we have much to discuss . tomorrow .
i have never seen a sight more beautiful than you , tonight .
d'artagnan .
my queen ...
then we will both die traitors , d'artagnan .
anne ... ! i know ... i know that to love you is treason against france . but not to love you ... is treason against my heart .
nothing ... nothing .
i ca n't bear to see you cry . what is wrong ?
if i do n't kiss you , i die anyway .
m'lady ... if anyone sees , it is death ...
no , stay back ! stay back !
what -- ?
m'lady ... ?
oh god i -- forgive me ...
that is good .
no , m'lady .
and you were not hurt ?
god smiled upon us .
i understand you saved my son 's life today .
m'lady ... ?
wear it until you love it . and die in it ! !
no , louis ! no !
d'artagnan , you will hunt down aramis , porthos and athos , and bring me their heads , or i will have yours . and as for you , phillippe ... back to the prison you shall go , and into the mask you hate .
he is nothing now .
he is your brother !
what had you to do with this , mother ?
my guards are useless ! take her from me !
louis , please -- !
yes . dead . two nights ago . the night of my dream .
it -- it does n't matter , mother ! he is dead now ! dead !
you have prayed too much . your mind is weak .
because i have dreamed of him . not as the baby they took away , but as a man .
why would you ask now ? you never asked before !
he was my blood -- and i demand to know what happened to him .
i am king , mother ! and i do not wish to discuss this with you .
first they told me he had died at birth . then your father admitted he was alive , but well cared for , in secret . but the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner .
he is dead ! by god 's choice ! there is nothing to discuss .
i wish to discuss your brother .
what is it , mother ?
we have n't visited in three years . and we should have privacy .
i am preparing for a ball !
may i speak with you ? alone ?
mother -- ?
shut up , knave !
d'artagnan , arrest them all !
phillippe ? ! why do you call me --
do n't look so shocked , phillippe . come , you 're going back to prison .
wh -- wha --
you bring me the heart of the jesuit general , and you will have a palace of your own .
i grow closer to my target , your majesty .
how goes that favor i asked of you ?
your majesty ...
once a musketeer , always a musketeer , eh ?
if i find out the identity of this jesuit rebel . i will kill both him and the man who told me .
perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the jesuits is . you are now a priest , but you were once a musketeer , serving the throne of france , a throne ordained of god . can you accept this mission , and keep it private ?
how can i serve you in this ?
i have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves ! can you imagine the arrogance ? common jesuit priests try to act as my equals , and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order ! no one can keep secrets like the jesuits can , and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold . even the pope himself does not know who leads the jesuit order in france ! he suspects the governor general of jesuits , whoever he is , is angling to become pope himself .
well ... perhaps you should speak with them , your majesty .
next week . this is a mere garden party -- and i wish to join it , so i will be brief . i am experiencing resistance from the jesuits .
your birthday celebration , your majesty ?
to the bastille . and death .
then to the bastille .
perhaps he serves a different king .
so what has changed ?
perhaps . but of d'artagnan i am certain . what he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his king .
you 're a fool !
he seeks redemption .
we ca n't ... stay here . that traitor d'artagnan ... knows about this place .
bloody hell ...
hold your goblet with two fingers .
remember , phillippe ... nobility is born in the heart .
it presses us but it is good for us too ! louis ' whims make him more vulnerable . we are less ready , but so are his guards !
but --
louis is planning a visit to the vatican , then who knows where after that . if we miss him now we may not get another chance .
aramis , this will never --
you said you 'd do anything , athos , anything to replace this king . so do it .
but --
i offer you the perfect revolution . a revolution without bloodshed , without any loss of life , even without treason , for he too is the son of the king .
what you 're asking is impossible !
he can learn to be phillippe in time . but first he must learn to be louis , and for that he has two more days .
but aramis -- ! phillippe can learn in time , but --
paris . there is still much to do . we 'll be back soon . be ready .
where are you going ? !
all i noticed was that phillippe feels even more like an animal .
the mask is terrifying ... especially when unexpected . do you notice ?
poor phillippe !
but -- but --
come now , athos , if porthos is determined to end his life , then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity .
we must stop him !
he 's threatened to do it , it 's been building up in him for months .
hang himself ? !
about to hang himself , i should think .
but -- what is he doing ?
now . you were saying ?
going into the barn naked -- or so it appears .
but -- what is porthos doing ?
go on .
do n't play god with me , aramis i --
you grow fond of him . that 's good .
phillippe -- he 's very bright , he 's perceptive , but he is in such turmoil --
the king is having a ball , a masquerade ball . it is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one . at any time phillippe could be discovered , and what then ? remember france . remember the poor . remember raoul . more wine ! ! where are those serving girls ... ?
three days ? ? ! !
three days .
in a year , maybe two , i could teach him enough to --
you can do it .
you must reconsider this plan . phillippe is like a child , he --
more wine ! !
resting , he 's had a long day . aramis --
how is he ?
yes , and he has a choice !
it is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours ! it is phillippe 's as well !
do you think i have not considered that ? i have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant !
and people close to him , who --
those can be adopted --
physical resemblance is but one small thing ! louis has an arrogance , a manner --
i have it all worked out .
switch ? ! that is your plan ? it is ludicrous !
there is that , of course -- but mainly it is because i am so much smarter than everyone else .
then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son . what gives you the right to judge me , to play god with the lives of others ? is it because you are so much holier than everyone else ? !
those are the words of a broken spirit . my spirit is whole . i have trusted d'artagnan with my deepest secrets , and i will never believe he is my enemy .
he who is not with us is against us .
you are bitter , athos . you are torn by grief , not only for raoul , but for d'artagnan , whom you love , and now treat as an enemy .
you are not my priest , aramis ! you would not be , even if i had one .
you seek facts , when it would be better to seek truth .
tonight ! right now ! we steal a man from a royal prison , we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide , and still you wish to tell me nothing ? !
tomorrow .
who is he , aramis ?
his plight is obvious , is n't it ?
excellent , athos . you have a keen sense of this man .
prison was horrible but it was his home . he 's been torn from it by strangers . he 's frightened , exhausted -- and the mask is familiar . let him rest in it tonight , and remove it tomorrow .
i see that is a body ! but where did you get it ?
a body .
what is that ?
come , we have a boat waiting .
the prison of belle sur .
soon enough . here we are .
porthos sleeps , and you plot . do n't you think it 's time you told me what it is you are plotting ?
making the key to the throne .
what are they doing ?
i am with you !
it can . i know the way .
replace the king .
what do you propose to do ?
well here is the problem at hand : the king has ordered me to discover the identity of the governor general of jesuits , and kill him . as our english rivals have left the catholic church , louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of europe by uniting church and state and making himself head of both . he has already picked the pope . only the jesuits , who put god above throne or papacy , stand in his way .
and some problems can not be settled without one .
i trained those men myself . they will stand and fight . but if we are to die , let it be this way .
d'artagnan ... those are young musketeers down there . they have been weaned on our legends . they revere us -- it is an advantage . why do n't we charge them ?
that does n't matter now .
they will know you helped us , if we go this way .
once you are through , do n't stop until you reach the river .
phillippe , get into the boat . into the boat ! now !
everyone back .
pull them back !
you ca n't do it .
pull them back , d'artagnan .
i know . god go with you .
i can not betray louis . i will defend him with my life .
the secret i carry i can not share . not even with god .
i have heard many confessions , d'artagnan . but even if i were not a priest , i could tell your heart has a secret weight , and it is hurting you to carry it alone .
you -- you can not ask me to betray my king ! i have sworn to him !
i will need you all . all for one . one for all .
no ! stop --
we have grown wiser with age . now we know that some problems can not be settled with a sword .
look at us . we are old men now . but once we were young . and when we saw injustice , we fought it .
still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem .
aramis -- the king wishes to see you .
a simple theological discussion .
he is right , d'artagnan .
d'artagnan . perhaps you should accept his offer , for we are dead anyway .
bread and wine ... in that cupboard .
can we eat ... before we go ? this excitement 's given me an appetite .
we will make our own luck tonight ... if phillippe holds up .
d'artagnan watches everything . we have to be lucky .
the queen mother . anne .
who ?
but what if something extraordinary happened ? something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else ? someone whose confirmation of phillippe the king would never be questioned .
then let him kill me , if all my faith is wrong .
he 's going to kill you , aramis .
did she have tits like that ?
so was mary magdalene , and our lord loved her .
aramis ... these are ... these are whores !
come on ...
let 's see you rob somebody with your pistol there !
why did n't you say so ?
we go someplace dangerous .
what use am i ?
coming ?
well ... well ... okay .
you 've been moping for months . now that you 've gotten the idea of killing yourself out of the way , you can stop boring me and start being useful to me . now get some rest .
because the old king had a twin as well , and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne . then he had two heirs , not just sons but twins . so he decided that one be put away , as if he never existed . you , phillippe .
but why ?
i carried the king 's child ! the queen had twins that night , and one of them was sent away , in secret !
athos , do you understand this ? he confuses me --
no , not louis !
the child of the king is ... the king . louis !
not just a baby , porthos . i carried the child of the king .
i do n't understand . what does this have to do with ... ? you carried a baby somewhere , it 's unusual , but --
but i was on duty ...
i remember that night . d'artagnan was drunk , the only time i 've seen him that way . the three of us were reveling , remember , athos ?
the greatest secret of life is who we truly are . now i must give you that secret , which has been kept from you your whole life . it began on the night when louis was born .
i will answer all your questions . but first soap , water , and a razor .
aramis ! athos ! he looks exactly like ... exactly like ...
i expected action . there was no killing , no fighting , i was useless .
and why are you so glum ?
easy to say , but hard to do . for what i am trying to tell you is that i am the governor general of jesuits in france .
it is a weighty problem , aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret general of the jesuits , whoever he might be .
so they tell us . but what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant , and the church , meant to stand for all those oppressed , has become the tool of oppression ? when no conscience is tolerated ? no dissent , no objection ?
but -- does n't god ordain both pope and king ?
catacombs . very holy .
a tomb ? we 're in a tomb ?
it is also a place of burial .
mother of god !
jesus of nazareth found the holy among the profane . if we are to have a place of private prayer , where better than here , beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river ?
where are we ?
hell may be our destination , dear porthos , but not this trip .
aramis ... is this the way to hell ?
ca n't you see i 'm praying , goddammit ? !
i observe your forgiveness is n't sweeter than a plump nipple .
forgiveness ?
forgiveness .
really ? if you can name me one thing , one single thing , that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips , i will buy you a new cathedral .
there are more important things than tits .
i just said you 're praying ! are you deaf too ? i know you 're blind , because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here , you 'd have tears in your eyes .
be quiet , you fat fool . ca n't you see i 'm praying ?
please revel with me , aramis , i need my spirits lifted . i 'm old , i 'm weak , my strength is gone --
it 's a prison , you idiot ! they do n't expect anyone to try getting in ! the problem will come when we want out !
it worked !
so what ? i 'd rather die covered in blood , than an old man , lying in my own piss .
you are right . but it is a trap .
what choice is there ? if phillippe is in the bastille , then to the bastille we will go .
he lures us to capture .
`` phillippe has been removed to the bastille , to the lower dungeon . at midnight tonight i will order the guard changed , and will delay the replacements for ten minutes . that should give you ample time . never have i needed more to say : one for all , and all for one . d'artagnan . ''
at a ball , everyone watches the king !
d'artagnan , unready ?
i do n't know about you , but i plan to wait here .
what do we do now ?
best not to ask . should n't even talk about it .
who does ?
he gets one day of confession each year . today is the day .
raoul --
goodbye , father . i am sorry .
raoul , no ... you can not do this . no matter how your heart is broken --
it is already done . i have just stopped at mother 's grave , to say goodbye , before coming to tell you .
fromberge ... ? ! at the front ? ! no .
i have rejoined the army , and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge .
die ? what ... ?
never mind , papa , it does n't matter now . she loved me once . i want to die remembering that .
piglet -- ? what are you -- ?
she can not possibly refuse . her family is poor , they have even less money than we do . and along with the invitation , the king sent the diamond pendant , from the piglet .
michelle can not possibly accept !
we were at her door . i was just taking the ring from my pocket , for the third time today , when a young musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the queen mother .
but -- are you sure ?
michelle , she -- the king has invited her to come live in the palace .
that must be raoul ! raoul ! look , d'artagnan 's come to visit ... ! what 's wrong ? you look awful !
she died giving you to me . and i want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves .
mother 's ring . i ca n't take this .
perhaps this will help .
i care only about michelle . should i ask her when we first arrive ? or ... or when we 're leaving ? i could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace . i get so confused ...
none of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you .
do i look all right ?
i came to see you safely out . check for yourself .
he lies . he is here to trap us .
i can not , athos . dearly as i love you , i can not .
if you ever loved me -- if you ever loved honor , or anything else -- then stand now , and let it happen .
no man is all bad ... or all good . i believe -- i must believe -- that louis can learn . and perhaps i can help him .
why do you follow him , d'artagnan ? ! i know you have put service above your own life , but why does this king deserve such loyalty ? he is a monster ! he executes ministers for his own blunders , with their families hostage so they take the blame ! he has no honor !
an oath is an oath precisely because it can not be removed !
it is honor you serve , and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor !
the cannons killed raoul ! the cannons , and love . but not the king .
the king killed my son !
athos ! i know life means nothing to you at this moment , but i will not let you kill yourself .
to kill the king .
where are you going ?
athos , i beg you --
get out of my way .
athos , please ... !
save my son , d'artagnan .
raoul is hurrying to the front , so i must hurry too .
you trust his character more than anyone else does .
i will also speak with the king , for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused .
oh my friend .
i know .
raoul is everything to me .
i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that raoul be kept far from the fighting .
what hope is there ? a wartime commission can not be vacated except by the king , and what chance is there of that ? fromberge is on the battle line , and raoul --
i fear i know our king . i came to try to bring you hope .
you knew this was happening . you knew and that 's why you came .
she 's a woman , d'artagnan ! from a poor family . you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything , but i am old and hard and i 've seen too much . even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire , because power seduces even more than love !
if the young woman truly loves raoul --
this can not be . everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse , and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king !
i was feeling sorry for myself . raoul is getting married , he proposed today ! i love that boy beyond all measure , i 've spent everything i own to give him education and opportunity . now he has complete happiness , and i mope .
i heard your playing .
another ? how many times have you saved his life in this year alone ? three ? four ?
they must stay sharp . there was an attempt on the king 's life today .
midnight ! mon dieu ! driving the youngsters hard , eh ?
i have ordered a drill of the royal guard for midnight , and must be clear-headed for it .
you ca n't drink with a friend you have n't seen in months ?
thanks , but not for me .
life is too long . except when we have our friends . look at you ! you 're still a boy ! sit , sit ! i 'll open a bottle of wine .
it 's been too long .
athos , my friend !
d'artagnan !
d'artagnan ...
all this time ... i was a lost secret . but you were hiding all your loyalty , all your love . you were the man in the iron mask .
if i could have a blade , then i would be please to run with you .
one for all . all for one .
how did you --
phillippe ... ?
she will be at the ball .
the room of the king 's favorite mistress ?
your mother 's .
whose rooms are those ?
these rooms are yours . up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress ... michelle .
porthos told me .
how did you know -- ?
is that the king of king you wish me to be ? or do you say this because of your son ?
no ! do not be sorry ! never be sorry ! the king cares for nothing and for no one ! there are no mistakes when you are king ! what you do is right for every person ! a king has contempt for everyone !
i am so sorry ! forgive me , i --
i will sit with you . i ca n't sleep either .
i 've worn this mask so long , i could n't sleep without it .
i did not share beauty with someone ... who is no longer here for me to share beauty with .
what is that ?
it is something i have done -- or did not do .
you look so sad . is it something i have done ?
i suppose ... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison , who pass such beauty every day , and never see it .
what is its antidote ?
the desire for vengeance ... can be a poison .
there is ... wrath ... in me . i have learned to hide it . those years in the cell , i dreamed that freedom would someday just happen , the way the mask happened . now i am free . and with each free breath i feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all i lost . look at this , all this that for ten years i could not see ! what if i become a king -- a king no different from my brother ?
phillippe ... there is something i hope you understand . terrible cruelty has been used against you . and ... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it .
perhaps not as much as you might imagine . when tutors answered every question except those about who i was . when i was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been , i knew there was something different about me . but a king ...
recent hours have been a shock .
phillippe . rest now .
the old man and woman called me ... phillippe .
and you never knew why ?
a man in black . i never saw his face . he took me to the cell . a blacksmith came and they put me into the mask . for days i shouted , `` what have i done ? why do you do this to me ? '' but no one heard , so i just stopped shouting .
who came ?
this place ... i once lived in a country house . i had guardians -- an old man and woman . and tutors . but no friends . then when i was twelve , they came and took me to the prison .
just ... water .
are you hungry ?
there .
where is michelle ?
they have plotted against me ! me ! the embodiment of god 's will !
aramis , porthos and athos too . i know what they have done was a threat against you -- and yet that threat has been removed , with no harm coming to your majesty . if their passions were in error , their spirits have ever been noble . forgive them .
forgive ? !
not once have i ever asked anything for myself . i ask now . forgive this man , this prisoner ... your brother .
get out of my way .
your majesty ... this man before you ... he is royal blood , the same as you . to spill it is the one thing even you can not do . it is against the laws of god , and of france .
my twin . which has kept him alive . until now .
i -- i thought he was but ... an impostor who resembled --
he is my brother .
... you knew you had a double ?
i was told this impostor was dead !
yes , your majesty .
even the bedchamber passages ! let none remain !
it shall be done , your majesty .
i want all these passages sealed ! another stupid idea of my father 's ! seal them all , every one !
... tired . must ... lie down .
your majesty ... ?
you will protect me as you always have , d'artagnan .
your majesty . this ball , with an open invitation to the nobility of paris -- we have no way of checking --
it ... was nothing . a nightmare , nothing more . go away , i --
i just left the garden , it was empty . what did you see ?
thank you , your majesty .
i will consider it . now leave me .
order fromberge to keep him in safety ! it is the least you can do , to protect your own honor !
silence ! i order you !
at least help raoul .
that is enough ! you are a good servant , d'artagnan , but you forget your place !
not criticize -- plead . love . love your people , and you will not bear to see them hungry . love women , and they will love you . love yourself , and --
you dare criticize my father ? ! or lecture me ? !
there is more to love than he knew , or that you know .
what quaint notions , d'artagnan ! but they contradict my father , who picked his queen when he was old , and only then to bear me .
it is not raoul 's heart alone that concerns me . it is yours . i know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like michelle . but do they love you ? do you love them ? what about a queen to love ? a son of your own ?
that is my desire , and my desire is what should concern you , not the sentiments of some commoner !
your majesty has had many women --
miss beaufort has accepted our invitation . by this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here .
in his mind , anyway , and soon enough in hers . she had written him many letters of love .
betrothed ? i think not .
mademoiselle michelle beaufort . she is betrothed to raoul , the son of athos the musketeer , who has served france through many tribulations .
a personal nature ?
then there is one more thing , of an even more personal nature .
i already know about the riots , d'artagnan , i heard them out there whispering . some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food . i will deal with it tomorrow .
it is for your security that i have come , your majesty -- for the security of your honor .
aaa ! d'artagnan ! these passages were constructed for the king 's security , not so you could step from my father 's portrait and startle me to death !
let us play a game , d'artagnan , let us pretend i am king and you are captain of my musketeers . let us behave as if my wish is law . and my wish is to enjoy this party !
but i deployed the royal guards according to your previous --
i am king , d'artagnan . i will change my mind as i wish , and i will enjoy my banquet as i wish !
then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
i decided it this morning .
the plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me .
what is it , d'artagnan ? assassins falling from the sky now ?
your majesty ...
i am unhurt --
phillippe !
no . even if i could give up my friends , i could never give up my son .
wait . bargain me to louis , for all your lives . you have done your best . let me go , and let all of you find peace .
i must insist , sire .
... the ball ... continue .
sire , we have an emergency -- of security . i must ask you to accompany me .
continue .
what was the end page ?
you 've ... memorized ... ?
two-thirty-seven : `` ... and the descendants of japeth are these : obediah , zebulon , hezekiah ... ''
... two-thirty-seven .
what number , on the first page ?
eh ?
what number did you tear out ?
thank you , keeper .
food , moron .
no , keeper .
you dead yet ?
shoot them ! shoot them !
magnificent valor ...
the corridor nullifies our number ... and no one has stomach to fight the captain .
cowards ! twenty run from four ? !
when he returns , watch him . when he leaves again , you tell me .
out directing the search for the traitors .
now . where is d'artagnan ?
not by you . i will order d'artagnan to do it .
do you want athos arrested , your majesty ?
you may go , lieutenant .
... he did -- but captain d'artagnan blocked his way .
who was athos seeking ? tell me ! did he try to enter the palace ?
no . he cut an ear from one of the men , no one else was hurt . captain d'artagnan allowed him to leave . athos was upset about the death of his son , at the front .
did they kill him ?
athos , the former musketeer , has just fought with several of your guard , at the musketeers ' gate .
yes , yes , go on .
i would not have disturbed you , majesty , but you ordered me to keep you informed --
what ... an excellent idea , your majesty !
exactly why it should be given away .
that food has spoiled . that is why it was not shipped to the army .
ah yes , the riots . we have food stocks on the wharves right now , no ?
aramis ! i have been expecting you ! we are satisfied , that will do .
majesty ... we have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week . if we distributed some of that , we would have time to gather more before --
sometimes the poor do grow hungry . but why would they riot about it ?
well yes , of course , majesty , and i 'm sure they are content ... except that ... well , they are starving .
riots ? my people live in the world 's most beautiful city , their king has the grandest palaces on earth . why should they feel anything but pride and contentment ?
we 'll burn in hell . both of us .
listen , my darling ... raoul was a ... a good friend . and now he is dead and that is very sad but --
raoul ... oh , raoul ...
oh louis , louis ...
i will order a mass for his soul . it will guarantee his place in heaven .
i did not want to upset you . it was tragic . i did everything i could for him . i ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety , far from the fighting . but he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger .
did you know ... about raoul ?
no , you may wait behind the screen .
shall i leave ?
if you do n't want to be so appealing , why did you touch the rose to your skin ? where was it ? here ?
sire , i --
you are beautiful . you know you are .
my dear , i 've already done it .
you would do that , your majesty ?
wait , no ! do not be ashamed . the straits of your family need not be permanent . it is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates , where they may have fine meals , and physicians to look after them .
i ... we are humble people ...
this is more than you are used to . your mother is a seamstress , your father is dead . you have three younger sisters , two of whom suffer from consumption . do n't look so surprised , kings know such things .
it 's lovely . it 's just ...
the food does n't please you ?
enough of this , our dinner waits .
raoul ... is in love ...
from raoul . he urges you to guard your honor -- as if it could be in any danger ... from your king .
a letter . may i see ?
... nothing .
how did i get in ? you 're new here , and will soon learn many secrets . what is that ?
sire ! i -- how did you --
you blush ! you do not wish to be beautiful to your king ?
sire , i --
i would have said it was impossible , but i believe the excitement of the chase has made you even more beautiful .
yeah , stick around , you might learn something .
you mind if i ride with you ?
or worse , we 'll have a hostage situation on our hands .
alright , we know who we 're looking for . play it cool until the time is right to make a move . let 's not pull any gangbusters shit or we 'll lose him again .
if you guys want in , fine . just remember this is our jurisdiction .
every step of the way .
cooperate ?
i 'm sure if our departments cooperate we can find out the truth .
that 's the point . he slipped up , and he 's desperate now . and that means he 's all the more dangerous .
if what you 're saying is true , then why would he have killed two police officers ? a man like that would want to lay low , if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission !
our agency monitors all threats very carefully , and there 's good reason to believe jim trudell has the training , the connections , and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large .
yeah ? ..well what are you getting at ? you saying he has an agenda down here ?
i do n't think you understand . i do n't mean shuffling papers in an office , i mean jim trudell worked classified assignments , special forces ... sabotage ... until last year . he was brought up on charges of espionage , but the charges were later dropped , and he sprang the service .
we ran the i.d . i could have told you that .
we did a little digging on jim trudell at sergeant zydowski 's request . he 's 31 , no priors , and he 's been working for the military for ten years .
yeah - i heard - nothing came up .
your department contacted our agency regarding information on sarah williams .
what can i do for you ?
yeah ?
captain doyle ?
alright , stay on the phone .
what do you think ?
you set to go -
we 're by ozone ...
where are you ?
yeah ?
no i mean ours , motherfucker ! if i go down everyone 's going with me - you and your crew especially ! you wo n't get protection , you wo n't get the trucks - nothing !
you mean shut your ass down !
so what is they have enough to shut us down !
so what ?
he walked in on fleming and took him out .
the shit just hit the fan , brother . that bitch has a partner and he got away from me .
what do you need ?
it 's marvosa -
well why do n't you sit this one and get some rest ... you look like shit . cut to int tubbs ' apartment - night
it 's just ... catching up with me , you know ?
something wrong with you marvosa ?
that 's got to our secret agent man ! do we have an address ?
outside hacker ? what the fuck are you talking about ?
hey what they did on their time was their business , you know ? i just want to catch this scumbag , wherever he is .
just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker , you know , some connection .
where do you come from , marvosa ?
got ta come from somewhere ...
it 's kind of a funny coincidence , is n't it ?
what ?
well do n't you think that 's odd ?
yeah i saw 'em around . they worked vice .
so you must have known fleming ... and stanton -
yeah ...
did you start out area six ?
nineteen eighty four . what fucking difference does it make ?
when did you join the force ? you know , the police force , the place you work ...
what ?
our getaway car . you said a cell phone ?
what 's this ?
fine -
i 'll take the south end -
i 'm sure you can handle it . now i want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from marine to 30th . foot beat units continue on the boardwalk .
these crowds are going to make it a bitch !
if you can trail him to a remote area do it . we all want a piece of him but let 's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here .
right behind you .
let 's roll -
fine ...
find out for me .
i do n't know , shit . maybe she was looking for love ...
but what was a hair dresser from malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar ?
so ? girls left bars with ted bundy too . it does n't rule out foul play .
sarah williams left the bar with trudell on her own .
what did the six-toes have to say ?
i did n't hit shit !
did you hit him ?
do n't worry -
do n't take any chances . call for back-up this time !
we 're all gon na fan out ! c'mon , let 's do a sweep of the alleys -
i 'm going to look for him on my own . fuck this .
great . well that changes a lot ...
he must have got the keys ... off stanton .
what the hell is this marvosa ! !
oh for chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of --
i do n't know how you 're used to doing things , marvosa , but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me !
it happened too fast . he was in the back , quiet and calm and boom ! he was out - and gone . we ... we fanned out ... stanton must have let his guard down !
why did n't you call for back-up ! what were you thinking , jesus ! ! !
he busted the back window with his feet , and fled on foot . we pursued him into this warehouse - but he 's - gone , south - maybe a couple of miles if he 's fast -
what the hell happened ?
we 've got kidnapping , grand theft auto , burglary , and two counts of murder on you , and i 'm gon na see to it personally that it sticks !
you can cut the shit , asshole --
did you report it stolen ?
bullshit ...
it was n't in the cards .
i tell you one thing trudell - you 'd make a hell of a cop ...
i 'll live ...
are you alright ?
yeah , it was opened - with a goddamn screwdriver ! ! !
i did n't break in - the back door was open !
so ... to get the car back , you break into her house .
she stole my car ! !
anyhow ... you wake up and she 's gone . but -- -- this is my favorite part -- she leaves you the keys to a brand new beemer .
i 'm done talking until i get a lawyer .
who am i ? i 'm gon na be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me . you understand ? where did you get the car !
and who are you ?
alright , where is she ?
nothing ! he did n't do nothing !
and what did he do to the girl ?
i was just having a little fun -
alright , alright ! we were just fucking with him..you know ?
now you listen to me hay-seed ! if you do n't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you 'll start giving me straight answers , you got that ! !
mm-hmm ... that 's not what the bartender told us .
hell , he probably raped her in the lot , dumped the body somewhere . that 's what he was like - a real wacko .
did he harm the girl ?
yeah ... the guy was psycho - i was just tying to protect the girl ...
and he took a swing at you ?
the guy was looking for trouble , shoving people around , being an asshole ...
well let 's get his ass to the garage ! some lead ...
he said he was following up some lead .
and where the hell is marvosa ?
could explain why fleming was there .
vice ... you think they had something to do with this dead hooker ?
well it 's just kind of a coincidence , is n't it ? stanton and fleming , both started in '83 , both in area six ... both in vice ?
something i do n't already know ?
well read this -
no zydowski i did n't read today 's paper - it 's just going to irritate the hell out of me .
did you read today 's paper ?
that 's great zydowski , you tech guys are really on the ball . harding - call the print lab at the fbi , run the prints through their library , see if it 's less screwed-up than ours ...
that 's not all . according to the computer - she died of a drug overdose last year .
what ? wait a minute -
her prints belong to stephanie field , convicted for soliciting two years ago .
yeah ?
you wo n't like this . i ran the prints from the house . no police record on your suspect -- at least not in our files . but there is a match on the girl .
zydowski . it 's about time .
lapd data center reports a breach on the system . an outside hacker has accessed files on detectives fleming and stanton ... and yours too , marvosa .
yeah ?
captain ?
good ! we 'll get it to the nearest outlying station and hold it for prints - we 're on our way - you coming ?
they found the getaway mercedes a parking garage north of venice . it checks out .
speak of the devil .
i lost him - i heard shots - that way ! !
where is he ? ! !
i do n't know - but he 's from the fbi .
who is it ?
captain there 's someone here to see you - he 's waiting in your office .
neither did i. i 'll make it up to you , i promise ...
no -
have you ever heard of the live oak river ?
where the hell is my car ?
yeah .
there 's something i 've been meaning to ask you , stephanie .
so you know about marvosa , and stanton , and all of them .
i took it with me . it 's in a safe place .
what happened with the tape ?
i did n't know what to do - but i knew i had something somebody would want . that 's where i met him - told him what i had . the fbi set me up with a new place ... but the cops found me somehow . so i ran ... and met you .
what did you do then ?
i had it all on tape ...
found what ?
i got out of there . i just grabbed up my stuff , and then i found it .
and what did you do ?
yeah ... they did . one girl ...
did n't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room ?
i was there , and it was no suicide . he was killed by professionals . i was in the bathroom when it happened .
no , but i 'm listening .
six months ago , a police lieutenant named charles fletcher was found dead in a hotel room - he blew his brains out - left no note , you may have heard of it ...
what exactly did you see ?
no . a witness .
look what are you anyway ? some kind of spy ?
i had to get away ! my life was in danger !
well you figured wrong ! and now i 'm public enemy number one . you have an answer for that ?
i did n't . i figured you leave it well enough alone .
why did you set me up ?
you 'll find out - soon enough .
what 's going on here ?
only on dates ?
no .
you always carry a gun with you ?
figure you would have tried it already .
you know , you do n't seem afraid of much either . how do you know i 'm not going to try to rape you ?
no ...
mind if i turn out the light ?
you 're the mysterious type , right ?
no ...
you got any family ?
seattle .
where up north ?
up north .
so where are you from ?
do n't worry about me ... ... and do n't forget your helmet . you do n't want to get a ticket .
are you going to be alright ?
i 'm going to need a way to get there .
i ca n't help you anymore , jimmy . i 'm sorry .
i told you i 'm not going anywhere ! i got my whole life in this place ! i 'll just destroy the evidence and play dumb .
tubbs , these people mean business .
i 'm not going anywhere !
that was her - the girl ... we have to go .
shit , we just started . but i better log out of this .
it 's not very much to go on ... is there anything else we can check ?
ahh , shit . we 're pretty much tapped out . i 'm getting denied access all over the place ...
and look at the balances ... these are n't police salaries ...
both at the same bank ...
who knows ? maybe he 's ordering army knives . i ca n't access that , but look what we have here ... these are the account records for fleming and marvosa .
a bank ?
ok ... marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas . and that 's switzerland 's country code .
what else is new ?
you know this time , there 's nobody that 's gon na cover your ass . you 're over your head this time .
i gave all that up . i got tired of the lies . they wanted to stuff me in levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment . it got so i did n't know who to trust anymore ... ... some things never change , i guess .
so ... what happened to you , jimmy ? i figure you 'd be in some far off place somewhere , living on the edge like the good old days .
i 'll access the lapd mainframe , but we got ta be careful - that one 's kind of tricky -
how about marvosa and the others ?
ok ... county tax records ... they 're saying 1490 breckinridge is owned by ... an atlantic trust corporation ... they have a p.o . box in d.c .
i got a lot of free time , you know what i mean ?
i knew i could count on you .
i do n't , but i 'm pretty sure . it 's a long story but i cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe . if they start a trace it will be to a pic'n'save on pico .
no thanks . how do you know they ca n't catch you on this thing ?
donut ?
let 's see what we got ...
1490 ... breckinridge ...
ok , i 'm logged on to the municipal network . i 'm showing sixteen people with the name sarah williams in l.a. county . none of them live in hollywood . do you remember the address ?
ok ... where do you want to start ?
i 've got a better idea ...
shit , what i have now made our setup in angola look like tinker toys . i 've been skipping through internal revenue records all day . i even have video strip poker . you want to check it out ?
i hope you have n't lost your touch with this stuff .
alright ... alright ... you 've saved my ass enough times . what do you want to do ?
i do n't know . but i 'm in trouble . i 'm all over the papers . i have to figure out what 's going on .
oh man ... what happened ?
i have nowhere else to go , tubbs , i need your help !
shit , you know what happens to me if i 'm harboring a fugitive ? i already think they 're on to me ! i thought you were the phone police for chrissake !
they 're inside the department , they 're everywhere - it 's not safe .
you got ta turn yourself in . before it 's too late -

just what did you get yourself into , jimmy ?
tubbs listen ! i do n't know anywhere else to go ! i need your help !

no ... i 'm in some trouble ...
well where are ya , what are ya , drunk ?
tubbs , it 's me .
jim trudell ! bravo company !
what ?
not with this ...
you do n't seem afraid of much .
screw him !
what would your - boyfriend - think ?
bartender said there are motels south of here .
we were fighting - i told him to let me out . so where are you headed ?
ditched you ?
are you serious ? my boyfriend ditched me ...
are you a regular there ?
well , you saved me from a bad situation . thanks . i admit this is ... unusual .
where did you learn to fight like that ? jim i read a book .
hop in .
i 'm stranded out here .
mind if i come along for the ride ?
i do n't have any real destination . i 'm just going south .
you must be going somewhere .
well i 've kind of had my fill of the place , you know what i mean ?
where are you going ?
county jail - get in .
where am i going ?
then what did you do , play canasta ?
no . it was n't like that !
did you have sexual intercourse with the woman in question ?
what ?
did you have sex with her ?
no - that 's not it ! she said her boyfriend stranded her up there ! i did n't ask her to come with me !
nahhh ...
yeah , and that 's all i 'm going to say . if you want to arrest me , go ahead ...
oh yeah ? you 're a smart man ? ...
i asked him not to tell me where he was going . i told him i do n't want any part of it .
long gone , huh ?
long gone ... marvosa well you wo n't mind if i do n't take your word for it , right ?
where is he ?
do n't you guys ever knock ?
i do n't recommend it .
could he handle a direct contact ?
if he pushes too deep into our boy 's mind-set , he may destroy himself . what are you planning , jack ?
what 's the bottom line ?
no . it happened when graham went to see hobbs ' daughter four months later in the hospital . she saved her carotid artery.. , but lost three fingers and her larynx . she was connected up to a voice box . when graham went to see her , she asked him -- through the speaker : 'why did you have to kill my daddy ? ' that 's when graham had his nervous breakdown .
that 's when it happened ?
i 'll tell you the events . the psychology 's none of your business . hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter 's throat . graham shot him with his .38 six times . hobbs still did n't go down . he had to wade in ...
his nervous breakdown followed hobbs . could he kill again if he had to save his life ? or would he hesitate ?
because i 'm professionally concerned about him . and he 'd pick up on that . he 's fast . he hates being prodded and poked . so do i. what do you want ?
why are n't you ever alone with him ?
he 's an eideteker . he has almost total recall . but i do n't think he 's psychic . what he has it empathy and projection . he can assume your point of view and mine.. , and some other points of view that scare and sicken him .
you 're never alone in a room with graham , are you ? you 're smooth about it , but you 're never one-on-one with him . why 's that ? do you think he 's psychic ?
i would n't presume to try .
he does n't think you run mind games on him .
it was you who did the asking .
that was peterson upstairs .
remember when you asked for a study on him , i refused . same goes for now .
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature .
what about him ?
kevin and molly are on their way to montana . who the hell is he to do this to my family , sidney ? answer me that ... !
how are molly and the boy ?
and do what ? read about the next family in the morning paper ? in my monkey ward safehouse 'cause i ca n't take my family home ? this ends when i make it over .
the usual motivation does n't apply to him , nor the way he uses them . i do n't have an answer for you . listen to me , my friend : leave this .
sidney : i do n't understand him . we know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience . to witness the act . we know he thinks the act is making him into something different . his 'becoming ' ... but i do n't know what it is he thinks he 's becoming . the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors . that 's what 's missing for me . why the mirrors ?
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict . a fear of being gay . he objects to the word 'fairy . ' plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead . i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr. leeds .
what have we missed ?
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor , he 'll come for me . so we 're going to set me up as bait to draw him out . give him a clean shot . that 's what you were thinking , is n't it ?
crawford has a proposition . i do n't think it 's a good idea .
he 'd know it from articles he 's read about lecktor ...
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell .
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student . he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip .
right . what about sweating lecktor ?
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out .
christ !
in thirty-five minutes .
he does n't have anything to cut with .
that 's probably in the part lecktor tore out . at the top it says : 'i hope we can correspond . ' and then the hole begins . it looks like lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away .
the main thing is : how was lecktor to reply .
library of congress .
where ?
have him meet me with pictures of lecktor 's books ...
willingham , when he tossed his cell , took polaroids so they could get everything back in place ...
no . galatians 15:2 ? galatians has only six chapters . the same with jonah 6:8 -- jonah has four chapters . lecktor was n't using a bible .
not the bible ?
'one hundred prayers ' could be the page number . the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter . but what book ?
book code ?
no . the numbers are n't right for a jailhouse alphabet code . it 's a book code . and your message has to go out in it , or he 'll know it 's not lecktor talking to him .
issue the toilet paper tear as a ...
if there 's any doubt , we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth . this is your boy ... he folded the bottom part , including what lecktor tore out . in this enlargement of the back side , oblique light revealed impressions . we can make out : 'six-six-six ' . i did n't spot it until i had this high-contrast print . i advised chicago as soon as i saw it .
when do they go to press ?
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now .
at the end is the tail of what could be an 'r .
that could be the tip of a 't . here and here . and here .
aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared . the tooth fairy 's ballpoint is n't ...
twenty minutes max .
how long do i have ?
'you 're very beautiful .
that 's it . lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me ...
'dear pilgrim , you honor me . '
read it .
we got an ad order in tonight 's `` tattler '' with 'six-six-six ' in it . it 's being telexed to you right now .
will graham , jack crawford ...
this is chester here . who am i talking to ?
i need to talk to you about will graham .
let 's go to bed . i 'll rub your back .
i 'll try to keep him as far away from it as i can ...
no . i do n't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone ' ...
talking about 'like , ' you do n't like me very much , do you ?
you would n't like it , either if you had it .
nobody 's better with evidence . but he has the other thing , too . he does n't like that part of it ...
he thinks you want him to look at evidence .
because it 's his bad luck to be special .
you 're his friend , jack . why ca n't you leave him alone ?
i have to .
whatever i say , you 'll take him away , wo n't you ?
it 's happening again , jack ...
wait for the back-up ! will ?
there 's somebody in the house , jack ...
stay in the trees .
i 'll cover the back .
three minutes .
how far away 's the back-up ?
get the roadblocks set on route three ! there 's an access road to the back of the house . that ought to be a second team 's approach . will graham and i are in an orchard due west of the house .
you 're not going to need that . because we 're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a st. louis pd swat team is going to take him . not us .
what ?
will ... ?
this is our boy ... !
fogel has four more names . he knows two : both dark hair . third 's a woman . fourth 's a handicapped parking permit ...
are your parking permits in the computer ? he drives a van .
parking permits ...
i want a chopper on the roof in three minutes . to meigs field . at meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the gulf stream .
it does , does n't it ?
see if there 's another label underneath .
have him peel the top label back .
no . it 's bob 's photo store in ...
is there a label on the jacobi can that says what lab processed it ?
what it 's going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds ' film can : gateway lab , st. louis , missouri .
there 's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows .
we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in . they 're in the far corner of the room under the windows .
it 's the guard in the storeroom .
do n't talk to me ! !
it 's getting late and ...
he had to .
you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered ?
because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed .
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way . when he was watching from the woods . why did n't he use it to go through the basement door ?
what 's that ?
that 's why the boltcutter .
you wan na watch this or what ? !
will ?
it 's a foregone conclusion . for christ 's sake , it 's eleven pm . the full moon is tonight .
it 's not over yet .
let 's admit we struck out this month . the gulf stream 's standing by . the basic lab stuff is on it . you , zeller , jimmie price , a photographer . anywhere he hits , we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes . we get the call , we roll . the scene 'll be very fresh ...
something lecktor said .
what ?
he 's a very shy boy ...
there is none ! we 've run it through the computer a dozen times .
there has to be .
there 's no connection between the families .
he 's very careful , very ... designed when he chooses . if we find out how he finds them , then we 'll find him .
how do i know ? !
vtr , film , polaroid , stills , what ?
it 's a word . killing them ... his delusion is : if he sees himself accepted enough times , he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time . and he would record it somehow . so he can see himself received over and over again ...
'changes ? '
he changes them into beings that accept him ... and he needs to see the acceptance , in the mirrors . i did n't understand the mirrors before . it 's very important .
when i 'm done .
when are you coming back ?
that 's narrow ?
milwaukee , madison , dubuque , peoria , st. louis , indianapolis , cincinnati , toledo and detroit .
what 's it narrow down to ?
from the lip wound , which happened seven hours before he got burned , we 've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would 've caught the 'tattler ' early tuesday morning .
i arranged for him to have a phone . i have to call him in a few minutes .
you got the message lecktor called ...
no .
asian studies at langley said the mark you found on the tree is a chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling . the character also appears on a mah- jongg piece . it means red dragon . that mean anything to you ?
i wo n't be here .
i 'll pick you up in ...
get me a plane !
wait , will ...
get me a plane ...
it says : 'graham home , 3860 desoto highway , marathon , florida . save yourself . kill them all . it 's your home address , will . the bastard gave him your home address .
tell me now .
i 'll tell you in a second . now listen to me : everything is okay , i 'm taking care of it , so stay on the phone when i tell you .
what 'd it say ?
will , bowman just broke the code . it was a james beard cook book . you need to know what it says right now .
who is it ?
we will feel sick for a very long time .
what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something besides write ?
run it .
it 's your call , will . what do we do ?
and if we pull it , we lose a week ... we only have two to the next full moon .
yes . and i 'm leery of running lecktor 's message without knowing what it says .
can we still get lecktor 's message out of the paper ?
we let lecktor 's message run as is and decode it after . or we pull it , work our the code and put ours in next week .
twenty-five minutes . we wo n't make it in time .
personal ads ?
... there 's three 't 's ' and an 'r ' in tattler .
we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler . the stuff about me and lector ? i do n't know any other paper that carried it ...
after we 've worked the note we want to replace it in lecktor 's cell . i do n't want him to know we found it . where 's lector now ?
sarah , order a chopper . i want the next thing smoking and i do n't care whose . ours . dcpd . or the marines . then call documents . tell them to scramble a team . i want everybody moving in five minutes . dr. chilton , please do not handle the note . i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up .
what is it ?
how 'd you know 'broken mirrors ? ' bribe a cop ? tell it to the u.s. attorney , lounds !
you .
who did he ask for ?
did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds ?
if the documents section ca n't do it ... i 'll send it up to langley ...
the mark ? yes .
is it weird ?
to recover the mind set .
for christ 's sake , why ?
... i 'm going to see lecktor .
see ? you do know something about him .
because he has a genuine taste for it , jack .
why ?
you think i 'm gon na spot him 'across a crowded room ? ' that 's ezio pinza you 're thinking about . the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky . he wo n't stop .
no other possibilities ?
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time .
we 're running it through the computers now . so far there 's no event or service that doubles back into both families . plus they were big consumers : snowmobiles , fishing trips , scuba , videogames , lots of routine medical and dental . it 's a haystack . what 's the other ?
we find an event that connects both families . same vacation hotel ; same hospital , different times . then we check employees and come up with a male nurse , hairdresser , whatever ... if we find out how he found them , then we 'll find him .
what 's one way ?
do n't expect too much from me , jack , all right ? we 'll get him one way or the other .
you can tell something about him or we would n't have found the finger print ...
i do n't know , jack . he 's got no face for me .
say we 've arrested a good suspect . you walk in and see him . what is there about him that does n't surprise you ?
atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders . five will get you ten they do n't come up with an identification . jimmie may in the finder program ... if he 's ever been printed and in his index .
i know ...
... snuck in the hospital while i was sedated , flipped back the sheets and shot pictures . the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls ...
why do n't you get birmingham p.d . a methane probe out of d.c. and have them cover the backyard ... maybe the cat 's dead and the kids buried it .
a cat . we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat . neighbors are watching for it .
mrs. leeds ' fingernails and toenails . i think he took off his gloves , jack . and dust all the corneas of all their eyes .
what do you want to do ?
he is good . bur not as good as price .
you said the guy down here is good .
get him to atlanta .
he 's working on the single print index . what time is it ?
jack , this is graham . is price still in latent prints ?
i 'll come back later . i got messages at the holiday inn to collect .
let 's talk after dinner . stay and eat .
these are all dead , will .
as long as they 're dead ...
if you ca n't look anymore , i understand ...
i am all right .
you look all right now .
i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think . i came down here to get away from all that .
that 's not entirely true , will . it 's the way you think .
that was three years ago . and by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing .
last two like this we had , you caught .
you do n't need me . i would n't be useful to you anymore , jack .
and i got you down here fixing fuckin ' boat motors .
the bureau already has the best lab . plus you have bloom at the university of chicago ...
why not ?
no .
will ... you saw this in the papers . the second one was all over tv . did you ever think about givin ' me a call ?
typed him from semen . he 's a secretor .
somebody hurt him ?
blond , right-handed , really strong , wears a size eleven shoe . the prints are all smooth gloves . he 's on a full moon cycle . both times . his blood is ab positive .
what else did you keep out of the papers ?
eighty-six so far . all cranks . he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces . none of them knew that ;
what was in the 'miami herald ' and the 'times . ' confessions ?
how much do you know ?
i do n't want to talk about it anywhere . if you brought pictures , leave them in the briefcase . molly and kevin will be back soon .
i should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work . you do n't want to talk about it here ...
they got shot a telex . they 're on if now ...
... twenty-eight minutes . cryptography at langley ?
let 's get to the physical .
not yet .
for christ 's sake get him !
he went to the men 's room .
where the hell 's graham !
will . get right back here . he just called .
he asked for will . he said he might call back tonight . i tried to hold him ... i 'm sorry ... he said 'tell graham `` broken mirrors . '' '
... but if we find him , the print as evidence will get a conviction , hold on . what ?
francis did a thing for you today so i could n't have you . and he was wrong . i am the dragon ! give me your hand .
it 's dragon . dragon ... red dragon .
the tooth ...
two groups of people were changed . leeds and jacobi . the police think they were murdered . do you know what they call the being that visited these people ? you can say .
some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta . do you know what i 'm talking about ?
am i alone in this room ? are you here ... why are you doing this ? !
francis ... ?
me .
who ?
it 's me .
who is it ?
yes .
you 'll come by ?
i 'll see you later . all right ?
are you okay ... ?
no . reba ... ?
i want to see you , too , francis ... should i come over ?
the developing room . i need to ... see you .
francis ? where are you ?
reba ...
i 'm fine , francis .
do you want a coke or something , reba ?
i 'll get it . stay right here . you look very good in the sun ...
i 'll get my purse .
i have work to do at the plant .
my sister 's coming by to pick me up for brunch . why do n't you come , too ?
no ! do n't go back into the house ... it 's too nice outside .
good morning ... if you show me where things are , i 'll make us some coffee ...
i 'm fine .
yes , are you okay ... ? !
is that you . d ?
i made you a gin and tonic . it 's by the side of the sofa ...
that was nice of you to think of that .
it 's a surprise .
ready to tell me what kind of 'outing ' this is ?
uh-huh .
i 'll probably go back to it someday .
you know you speak very well , although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech . at the riker institute for the blind . i trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children ...
you worked out well .
they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract .
how did you come to gateway ?
in the kitchen .
tonic will be fine .
come on in . how about a gin and tonic ?
dandridge is a condescending prick . ride with me . it would be because i want you to .
thanks , but i 'll take the bus . i do it all the time .
ride with me .
no , thanks . i manage very well . i 'll order you twelve hundred feet : of 1000 c tomorrow .
i 'll take you .
it 'll do fine .
the 1000 c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness . i keep the samples straight by touch code . it 's still easier to handle than a 1200 series . think it 'll do ?
let me stick this in the black hole .
in eight days .
when do you need it ?
the activities of nocturnal animals .
what 's being photographed ?
shooting at maybe eight feet . i ca n't use any lights .
can you give me an idea of the conditions ...
put your back against the door . come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left .
ms. mcclain , i 'm francis dollarhyde . i came about the low light level infrared film stock .
i want her ! i want her alive ... i 'm going to keep her ! you hear me ! ! !
you give me her and the shermans ! you better give me both !
shut up . stop . stop it .
she 'll fuck other people . pretty people . she 'll put in her mouth their ...
no !
they 'll make you be a piece of shit again . they 'll make you be a harelip again . you better give me what i want !
no .
they will find out about you . they will lock you in a place worse than brother buddy 's .
good . we 'll seal your promise with ...
absolutely ,
you will tell the truth ?
you 'll let me go now ?
you did very well . i apologize for the crude images . next time i 'll have film stock that does n't need lights .
'i have had a great privilege . i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon . all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham . he made me write them . now i understand . 'will graham : you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread . because i was forced to lie , he will be more merciful to me than to you . 'i will be a testament to the truth , now . about his work . about his becoming . '
now you will read this into the tape recorder .
no .
are you queer , mr. lounds ?
god , no .
do you imply that i 'm a queer ?
yes .
are you a man ?
not me .
'no ' what ?
please , no .
do you see ?
oh , god .
freddie lounds . your photograph . do you see ?
yes .
mrs. jacobi after her changing . the dragon rampant . do you see ?
yes .
mrs. leeds harlequined with blood , her husband beside her . do you see ?
yes .
do you see ?
yes .
do you see ?
yes ...
look at the screen . that is william blake 's 'the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun . ' do you see ?
mr. lounds , you 're a reporter . you 're here to titillate your readers . if you do n't open your eyes , i 'll staple your eyelids to your forehead .
no . i do n't want to see you .
open your eyes , mr. lounds .
in a little while i 'll help you understand .
i do n't know ...
do you believe god is in attendance here , mr. lounds ?
yes .
do you pray to god , mr. lounds ?
i 'm very scared .
do you feel privileged ?
yes .
according to you i 'm a sexual failure . an animal , you said . you know now , do n't you ?
i do n't want to know .
do you know who i am , mr. lounds ?
atoning , mr. lounds .
what am i doing here ?
let me lie down . listen , i want to call my office . my god , i 'm in a stryker frame . my back 's broken . tell me the truth .
burned ? burned . no . you just rest there . i 'll be right back .
my back hurts , my skin . did i get burned ? i hope to god i 'm not burned .
no , mr. lounds . you 'll be just fine .
was i in an accident ?
are you cold ? would you like a blanket ?
no .
put it down on my desk blotter and do n't touch it again . has anyone else handled it except you ?
yeah . it 's right here .
do you have it ?
when we were cleaning out dr. lector 's cell , he heard us coming and hid something in a book ... we got him out of there and dug around ...
yes ?
dr. chilton .
come in .
three , four hours .
how long can you keep lecktor out without him getting suspicious ?
in a holding cell .
it 's written on toilet tissue . 'my dear dr. lecktor , i wanted to tell you i 'm delighted that you 've taken an interest in me . i know that you alone can understand what i 'm becoming . 'i know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things , understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what i am becoming . just as the source of light is burning . mr. graham , there 's a hole torn and punched out , then it says ... 'i have a complete collection of your press notices . i think of them as unfair . as unfair as mine . the `` tooth fairy . '' what could be more inappropriate . investigator graham interests me . very purposeful looking . i hope we can correspond . there 's another piece missing here . i 'll read the bottom part . 'after i hear back from you , i might send you something wet . signed : avid fan . it has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom .
can you read it to me ?
where did you get it ? !
well , it 's about goddamn time ! i have a note here , or two pieces of a note , that appears to be from the man who killed those people in atlanta and ... .
it 's will graham ...
uh ... sure ...
i want to see lecktor now .
when you saw dr. lecktor 's murders , their 'style , ' so to speak , were you able to reconstruct his fantasies ? and did that help you identify him ?
no .
the consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of dr. hannibal lecktor is you , mr. graham . can you tell me anything about him ?
as long as it 's on soft paper . you may ... find this curious .
i might have to show him some material that could stimulate him .
dr. lecktor will stay in his room . that is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints . one wall of his room is a double barrier . i will have a chair put just outside .
thank you very much .
3680 desoto highway . marathon , florida .
now i 'll bet it has his home address there , too
federal bureau of investigation , tenth and pennsylvania , washington , d.c .
we 're looking for graham . the man the book is supposed to go to is a mr. will graham .
okay .
well , zip that little pointer right on down to the letter g .
yeah ...
i 'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone .
she does n't have a rolodex .
i have to catch federal express within about five minutes . i 'd be immensely appreciative if you 'd pull it out of her rolodex for me .
she 'll be in , in the morning ...
maybe you can help me . this is bob greer of blaine & edwards publishing company . dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of 'the psychiatrist and the law ' to someone . linda never sent me the address and phone number .
linda does n't come in nights .
hi , linda . ..
linda king 's desk .
goodbye .
i do n't want to do that ,
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs. leeds and i 'll tell you if you 're right or not .
he 's white and six feet tall . you have n't told me anything yet .
that 's true .
he 's very strong physically .
cut the general crap .
he 's misunderstood .
most people are .
he 's right-handed .
i do n't think i 'll tell you .
let 's get straight who we 've talking about . are you the man i 'm interested in ?
you tell me what you know about him . i 'll tell you whether you 're right or not .
talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they do n't have the capacity to even understand what 's going on . do you ?
i get a lot of calls . most of them are from people who say they know things .
why do you think i called ?
do you know something about that ?
atlanta and birmingham .
i do n't understand .
no . i can help you .
this is will graham . can i help you ?
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog ?
no .
was the dog wearing a collar with the leeds ' name on it ?
it 's at the vet 's . the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen . icepick or an awl .
what about the dog ?
i understand he cut you pretty good ...
i call him a monster .
to yourself ...
what would you call him ?
psychologists call him a sociopath . they do n't know what else to call him .
what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecktor ?
one 's on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore . the other is in a private mental hospital in denver .
what happened to them ?
nine that we know of . two did n't die .
the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr. lecktor three years ago . he killed nine people , did n't he ?
sex murder : three . he likes to bite . six bad ones in mrs. leeds . eight in mrs. jacobi ... ... that 's all i have .
what 's average ?
that 's all we know about . most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center . a suck mark . these do n't . so , for him , biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior . you could try emergency room personnel , treatment for bite wounds . i know that 's pretty thin ... he bites a lot .
he only bit women so far , right ?
he may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse .
yes . 'intimate . ' they had privacy . everybody else was dead .
'intimate ? ! ''
mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman . i 'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation , would n't you ?
why do you think he took his gloves off ?
the report did n't mention nails and eyes .
our people swear he wore surgeons ' gloves the whole time . they dusted everything .
you got a deal ...
let 's forget who said what to whom ...
yeah . that 's great . a little time . i tell you what , buckaroo ... see you around .
maybe we should give it some time ...
okay . they 're full of shit and they make me sick ...
that 's not true .
they do n't want me up there . every time they look at me i remind them ... if they thought about it , they 'd want you . bur all they really want 's the boy . and they 'll take you . but they do n't want to see me ...
will ? you could come up here .
small difference : i 'm not dead , yet .
i came up here after kevin 's father died . they were very supportive and helped me adjust . i got myself together . i 've gotten myself together now , too .
what 's the problem , molly ?
it 's what kevin called her when he was little ...
what 's this mama shit ?
will , they never get to see kevin and a few more days ...
come home with me .
mama has all kevin 's uncles and aunts coming down from cheyenne next week and ...
today 's wednesday . by friday i ought to ...
i want to see you , too .
not too bad . i 'll be here a few days longer . i want to see you .
will ? are you okay ?
mama was probably asleep .
i was out in the garden . mama came out and told me when she saw it on tv . why did n't you call me ?
hello .
will ...
you should go to montana . stay with kevin 's grandparents . they have n't seen him for a while . i 'll come and get you afterwards ...
william : you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed .
no . i have to be in there ... alone . maybe there 's something for me if i know how he feels and thinks .
is crawford going with you ?
i have to go back to birmingham .
what will you do ?
where we 're at is nowhere . we have nothing . we 're running out of time .
and ... where are things ?
no .
can you quit ?
i wanted it over fast . it felt dirty to not tell you .
then why ?
no .
have you ever omitted telling me . things before ?
i 'd like one of your cigarettes , please .
you have n't smoked in two years .
can i have one of your cigarettes ?
yes . i said this is too good to live ...
do you remember what you said ?
i remember .
you remember when we first met ? and were together alone in that room . and the exhilaration was too much to hold on to . and then something flickered across your face like a shadow and i asked you what was wrong ?
good for him . thanks a lot , freddie ! kevin . we 're going grocery shopping .
he did n't know you had been in a mental institution . be asked me if i knew . i said yes . i wanted to talk to him . he said he wanted to bring it up to you . face to face .
you did n't do it to me , will ; it 's happened to us . and if i survive the wallpaper we 'll be okay ... he 's after you now , is n't he ?
... sorry , molly . i 'm sorry this happened to you .
i love you ...
molly , dear molly . go to bed now , baby ...
hey , goddamn it , paint it shit-brown for all i care ... look , i 'm sorry . when i come home , we 'll go to the paint store together and get some chips and ...
blue is cold .
blue , then .
yellow 's a bad color for me . i 'll look green at breakfast .
yeah . ah ... yellow , let 's paint it yellow .
i 'm thinking about painting the kitchen . what color do you like , will ? are you there ?
i have to see somebody .
to do what ?
i do n't know . i 'm goin ' up to baltimore this afternoon .
will you be in atlanta for a while ? i 'm not buggin ' you about coming home , i just wondered .
eating junk food . they do n't have a lock on anything , molly . there 's not enough information . or i have n't done enough with it ...
kevin 's fine . he had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in . the dogs dug them up . tell me what you 're doing .
let 's keep it the day-to-day stuff . how 's kevin ?
which part ? that or the day-to-day .
tell me about yourself .
me , too . and very erotic ...
none you 'd notice . i 'm lonely ...
at the store . you doin ' some good ?
hey , baby ! where are you ?
hello , hotshot !
mmmmh ... i love you , too , will . good night .
it 's me . i 'll call you tomorrow , sweetheart . go back to sleep . i love you ...
huh ? will ? is that you ?
molly ?
i do n't care . he 'll never see me or know my name . if we find him , the police will have to take him down . not me , i 'm just looking at evidence .
stay here with me . me . me . me . and kevin . that 's selfish , huh ?
if i were ?
what you 've already decided . you 're not really asking .
what the hell can i do ?
all the things that happened to you before make you know that ...
we have it good , do n't we ?
you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma . you are open and easy now ... it took you a lot of work to get to that ...
i 'm a forensic specialist , molly . you 've seen my diploma ? i got a diploma and everything .
i said you are fine , he should leave you the hell alone .
and you said ?
he asked how you are .
what did he want ?
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here .
tell her i called .
what 's that ?
i know ... 'out in the good air ... '
my grandboy 's been eatin ' a ton of breakfast every day . been out riding . must be the good air . you oughta see that little booger eat . i 'll bet he 's gained ten pounds . molly 's out in the motor home ...
yes . is molly there ?
you going back down to florida after ?
sure he is . blond . probably scandinavian , too ...
well , how you doin ' , mr . graham ? ! you sure are in the center of a storm . burning up lots of taxpayer 's dollars , too , i bet . on the news they said he was a white man . he is n't really , is he ?
it 's will graham . is molly there , mr. swenson ?
go on to the house ...
lt. fisk said ...
go on to the house .
meet point 's up ahead !
thanks .
there 's a vtr setup waiting in your hotel room , that you asked for . they transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch vhs .
that 's right .
i 'll come inside with you , if you like , but mr. crawford said you 'd probably want to be alone .
thanks for the lift .
i ca n't thank you enough , i ...
no , i 'm okay . i just wanted to ... ... stop by and ...
we 're fine . fine . we 're all well . we 're okay ! that man , crawford , called and ... told me ... ... how 'bout a drink ? coffee or something ?
oh , jesus ... come in . honey ... !
my name 's will graham . i ...
yes . who are you ?
are you george sherman ?
what do you want ?
you like that colombian stuff , do n't you ?
huh ?
what kind of coffee do you like ?
... yes .
and hobbs died ?
... after a while .
she got all right ?
no .
did the girl die ?
yes . hobbs had one of his daughters from behind . he was cutting her . i shot him .
you went in the apartment ?
with a knife . i found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls . the kind of shred a pipe threader makes . i was taking a look at steam fitters , plumbers . it took a long time . in one place there was a resignation letter from a man named hobbs . i saw it and it was ... , peculiar . i was going up these stairs to hobbs ' apartment . i was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me . she was dying . i sent the officer with me to call a swat team . but i could hear kids in there and screaming . i could n't wait .
how ?
hobbs was insane . he was attacking college girls and he killed them .
how did it happen ?
no . it 's just my job to find him . i was in the hospital after garrett jacob hobbs .
are you gon na kill him ?
we do n't know that .
i told my dad before he died , i 'd take care of mom . and i 'll do it . this guy wants to kill you ?
i was in the psychiatric wing . it bothers you , finding out i was in there ... does n't it ?
i figured i 'd ask you ...
yes .
barry 's mom had this newspaper . it said you killed the guy in minnesota and were in a mental hospital . is it true ?
no . you 're very well-protected . no one can find our where you are .
is there anything i need to know to see about mom ?
what is he ? afraid to leave you alone with me now ? ' he read the tattler piece , did n't he ?
i 'll hang around in here . i 'll just be in the kitchen , mom ...
it 's a precaution ... why do n't you run down to the bay . they got a swimming float .
yeah , but not now ... these will all make it ... guaranteed .
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea , huh ?
in this hatchery ? forty to fifty .
how many turtle eggs you think are in here ?
yeah ...
will it keep them out ?
it feels good because : if you do as god does , enough times , you become as god is : powerful ...
why does it feel good ?
you should , will . god 's terrific ! he dropped a church roof on thirty- four of his worshippers in texas last wednesday night . just as they were groveling to him and singing a hymn . do n't you think that felt good ? he would n't begrudge you two measly murders .
i do n't believe in god .
when you were so depressed after you shot mr. garrett jacob hobbs to death , it was n't the act that got you down . did n't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good ? and why should n't it feel good ? ! it must feel good to god . god does it all the time !
fight what ?
i want to help you , will . you 'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself . we do n't invent our natures , they 're issued to us . along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else . why fight it ?
i 'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches . if you 've got something to say , lecktor , say it .
you know lounds 's enlightened me on one thing : your confinement in the mental hospital . my attorney should have brought that our in court .
what do you want ?
i wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on mr. lounds . i admired it enormously . what a cunning boy you are , will .
goodbye , dr. lecktor . you can leave messages for me at the number on the file .
do you know how you caught me , will ?
no .
i 'll study it , will . when you get more files , i 'd like to see them , too . you can call me . when i have to call my lawyer , they bring me a telephone . would you like to give me your home number ?
i have n't decided yet .
may i keep the file ?
when you do have one i 'd like to hear it .
i do n't have one right now .
i want your opinion .
you came here to look at me , will . to get the old scent again , did n't you ?
yes . i 'd considered it .
it 's not 'interesting ' . you thought of it before .
that 's interesting .
because , my dear will , if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon , he might go outside and look at it . have you seen blood in moonlight , will ? it appears quite black . if one were nude , it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing .
big backyards , fences , some hedges , why ?
what were the yards like ?
you have n't threatened to take away my books yet .
good-bye , dr. lecktor .
do you dream much , will ?
no .
let me have them , and i might consider it .
yes .
pictures ?
yes .
do you have the file with you
i do n't think i 'll persuade you . you 'll do it or you wo n't . dr. bloom is working an it anyway , and he 's the best ...
do n't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity .
you 're very tan , will .
you 're insane .
what disadvantage ?
you had disadvantages .
then how did you catch me , will ?
no . i knew that i 'm not smarter than you are .
then by implication , you think that you are smarter than me , since you caught me .
i thought you might be curious to find our if you 're smarter than the person i 'm looking for .
pray tell .
you 'll get to see the file on this case . and there 's another reason .
chilton ? gruesome , is n't he ? he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle . he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test . hah . sat there waiting for mf-13 to come up . it 's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground . i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation . i laughed in his face . never mind , it 's boring .
there are things you do n't have . research materials ... i could speak to the chief of staff ... ?
why should i tell you ?
i thought you would have some ideas .
in the papers . i do n't tear out the articles . i would n't want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid . you want to know how he 's choosing them , do n't you ?
you read about it , i 'm sure .
yes .
it 's about atlanta and birmingham .
yes , i thought so .
i want you to help me , dr. lecktor .
it does n't matter to me , will .
it 's in the transcript . what does it matter now ?
no it 's not . do you know how you did it will ?
you 've read the transcript . it 's all there .
a layman ... , layman . interesting term . so many experts on government grants . and you say you 're a 'layman ? ' but it was you who caught me , was n't it , will ? do you know how you did it '
very interesting , even to a layman .
and ?
dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry .
of course , you do n't . i 'm glad you came . my callers are all professional . clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere . second-raters , the lot .
no .
emotional problems , i hear . he was a very promising young officer . do you ever have any problems , will ?
stuart is fine .
and how is officer stuart ? the one who was the first to see my basement .
i got it . thank you .
did you get my card ?
i keep getting it for christmas .
that 's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago .
let 's walk the route .
you got it .
because he 's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times '
i hope you have a second chance ...
kevlar second chance .
... commercially prohibited . number twelve shot in liquid teflon in a copper casing . on impact it all opens up in the target . expect the recoil . they 're hot loads . body armor ?
glaser safety slugs ?
good . you 'll load these , ever fire them ?
yes .
i 'm gon na spray your suit jackets . it 'll be invisible in this light , but you 'll stand out like a zebra for us . they told me you checked out a .44 charter arms bulldog .
pretty well .
... if he 's smart he 'll approach from the front , pass , and take you from the back . how well do you hear ?
yeah ! he 's a psychic surgeon in the philippines , and he 's amazing ! he rubs you and sucks the disease right out !
really ?
ehhh , you know those guys . if he had his way , i 'd be stuck in the hospital , running tests all day . and anyway , i 've found a new guy who 's gon na be able to instantly remove the cancer .
did your -- doctor say it 's okay for you to go back to work ?
yeah ...
my hair is coming out .
you 've got good days and bad days .
i ca n't move my arm .
then he 'll borrow it . i know tony better than you do . even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off , he 'll do it !
you know tony does n't have that kind of money .
tony clifton .
so who 's gon na pay for it ?
i do n't care about the money . i just want the show to deliver .
no clubs . i wan na reach the top ! carnegie hall ... !
do you wan na tour the clubs ?
i wan na go back to work and put on a happy show . the best show anybody 's ever seen !
so how can i help you ... ?
y-yeah ? well , then it has to stop ! because if these bad vibes get out ... then everyone will be talkin ' about how sick i am , and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy , and then -- i 'm dead .
andy , you 're surrounded by what you create . you are the king of negative energy .
of course ! but that does n't mean i do n't need everyone 's support ! i ca n't be surrounded by negative energy .
you must take a little pleasure in it .
it 's visualization therapy . he 's helping me turn inward and fight the disease .
what was that all about ?
i -- i got some freaky rare kind . it 's called large-celled carcinoma .
that 's ridiculous . you do n't even smoke .
no , it 's true . i have lung cancer .
andy , they do n't think you suck . they 've just ... lost a reason to love you .
the world thinks andy kaufman sucks . so i was just giving 'em what they want ...
andy ... it 's me . i 've got some crummy news . taxi 's been canceled .
hey ! our first phone call ! hello ?
andy ! you do n't get it ! they do n't want you back .
maybe i can turn it into a bit . i can go back on the show , and say it was rigged . demand a recount ...
you 're blind ! there is no envelope anymore ! ! it hurts me to say this ... but there 's only one solution -- i do n't want you two to ever work together again .
we were just trying to push the envelope --
he is the southern heavyweight champion . he 'll kill you . first , you piss-off women . then you piss-off the south . then you get killed ! and i did the bookings .
what , you do n't think i can beat him ?
andy , do you realize you do n't do comedy anymore ? where 's that sweet guy who used to do `` here i come to save the day ! '' ? please , enough with the wrestling ! you 've lost touch with reality !
that 's because they 've only seen it once . but i 'll do it again , and again , and again ... they 'll catch on !
wrong ! you have n't given them any clues that it 's a parody !
they 're having a laugh ...
no , i 'm not gon na take it . if i take it i 'll break my back .
that means it was a success . i woke up the audience -- like punk rock ! here , take this .
but i feel you 're extending this philosophy to real life . it 's obsessive . nothing 's ever on the level anymore .
george ... i 'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them . but short of faking my death , or setting the theater on fire , i do n't know what else to do . 'cause i 've always got to be one step ahead of them .
`` funny '' ? i dunno . but `` intriguing '' ... `` mindboggling '' ... perhaps `` headache-inducing '' ... sure . like , that moment , when you both came onstage ...
but was n't it funny ?
you 're so proud . you 're like some retarded kid comin ' home from school : `` look , dad , i got an f ! ''
there 'll be other shots .
oh dear ! george , this is gon na kill tony . he 's waited his whole life for this break .
oh no ! did he get hurt ?
i 'm here with ed over at taxi . there 's been some trouble with tony .
oh , you know the bay area ! always foggy !
hi , andy . how 's the weather up there ?
hi , george ! good to hear from you !
i do n't know ! andy ... you need to look inside : who are you trying to entertain ? the audience ... or yourself ?
how long would they let me sleep ?
and that 's great . but do it in la and new york ! there you experiment ! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage ! i do n't care !
but george , i like to push the boundaries ...
when you play the midwest and south , you do n't mindfuck these people ! it 's not postmodern -- it 's rude . if you wan na perform in texas , you give 'em mighty mouse ! you give 'em elvis ! !
you 're damn right you 're sorry ! and you -- you 're the road manager ! you should be watchin ' out for him !
i 'm sorry , george ...
okay ... i 'll go back . but just let them know , first they ai n't gettin ' latka . they 're gettin ' tony !
you signed for five years -- so four years , seven months .
yeah , we can have a garage sale . `` hey look , i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents ! ''
tell you what . i 'll book you on some concerts , and meanwhile , we 'll show the special around ... see if somebody wants to buy it --
the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special !
look , i 'm sorry . they 're assholes ! but we work in a creative business . you ca n't predict what people are gon na like --
what 's up ?
andy !
that 's alright . where ... ?
of course . but only on monday nights .
eh , hi , andy . look , this tony clifton ... is he performing anywhere ?
hi george !
andy ?
he 's a vegas entertainer . i used to do impressions of him . we sorta ... got in a fight over that .
they 're impossible ! ! jesus ! i mean -- `` two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton '' ? ? ! who is this tony clifton ? !
those are my terms .
are you makin ' fun of me -- ? this is ridiculous !
of course ! that 's what negotiations are for .
okay . fine , i 'll do it . but i have a few terms .
listen , you arrogant putz ! i 've been in this business for twenty years ! i know ! if you walk away from this opportunity , you will never , never see another one like it again ! ! ! !
i refuse .
you have to do it .
i 'm not interested . i want to create my own material .
b-but , this is classy ... they did bob newha --
i told you , i 'm not a comedian . and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment : stupid jokes and canned laughter .
andy ... this is every comedian 's dream .
no to the whole thing . none of it sounds good .
`` no '' ? `` no '' to which part ? ?
no .
hang on , you ai n't heard the best part ! abc has seen your foreign man character , and they want to turn him into -- `` latka , '' a lovable , goofy mechanic ! ! !
george , i hate sitcoms .
i 'm -- fonzie ? george no ! the fonzie ! the crazy breakout character ! the guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes !
and this is a class act ! it 's the guys who did the mary tyler moore and bob newhart shows ! it takes place in a taxi stand ! and you 're gon na be the fonzie !
sitcom ... ?
that 's ... terrific ! but i got something better . this is big ... you are getting a once-in-a- lifetime , unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on ... a primetime network sitcom ! ! ! !
the stewardess let me keep my headphones .
andy , c'mon in ! thanks for flyin ' out here ! !
i 've always wanted to play carnegie hall .
you show a lot of promise ... but ... my concern is i do n't know where to book you . you 're not a stand-up ... your act does n't exactly translate to films ... help me ... where do you see yourself ?
i 'm not a comedian . i have no talent . i 'm a song-and-dance man .
people love ... comedians .
it 's a veddy small island in de caspian sea . it sunk . george oh . hm . i 'm uh , sorry . well , look , i 'm probably out of my mind -- but i think you 're very interesting . if you ever need representation ... we should talk .
caspiar ? i have n't heard of that .
no . caspiar .
so i understand you 're from lithuania ?
tank you veddy much .
hey , i really enjoyed your set .
well , everyone else gets this place cookin ' ! pal , it 's hard for me to move the booze when you 're singin ' `` pop goes the weasel . ''
i do n't swear . i -- i do n't do what everyone else does !
sure ! comedy ! make jokes about the traffic . do impressions . maybe a little blue material ...
what do you want ? `` take my wife , please '' ? ?
look -- i do n't wan na seem insulting . but ... your act is like amateur hour : singalongs ... puppets ... playing records ...
you 're firing me ? ? you do n't even pay me !
eh , i dunno ... andy . i 'm ... thinkin ' of letting you go ...
so , mr. besserman , same slot tomorrow ... ?
but that 's it . i needed you to believe ! our family will be in the newspapers . people will look , and they 'll be touched . because your emotions were honest !
andrew -- how dare you ! ! for all we knew , you were dying ! look at your mother -- she 's still shaking !
nah , it 's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing . it did n't hurt at all . it was just a yoga move . i tucked my head in .
b-but ... we saw ... your neck ...
nah , it 's phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing . it did n't hurt at all . it was just a yoga move . i tucked my head in .
b-but ... we saw ... your neck ...
no ! that is not an audience ! that is plaster ! an audience is people made of flesh ! they -- live and breathe ! got it ? !
b-but i have them .
you know that 's not what i meant ! look , i 'm gon na put my foot down ! no more playing alone . you wan na perform , you got ta have an audience !
but i 've got a sports show . championship wrestling , at five .
oh !
andy !
maybe i should talk to the natives . shoom boom boo ba ! shoom boom boo ba --
these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks , only you never see it , because they cut to commercials . now for sure they 're gon na fire me , so if you want to see me again , you 'll have to come to memphis ...
cue the commercial !
okay , great ! so let 's reset !
right ...
deal .
ten .
twenty !
five .
but it 's only for thirty seconds !
andy ... uhh ... this network has a long-standing policy : the viewer must be able to see the program .
but it 's funny ! it 's a practical joke . they 'll get frustrated !
andy ... we do n't want the viewer to get out of their chair . they might change the channel .
i 've never understood that . it 's just ... getting dark . but i like you ! hey ! why do n't we fill the car with gas , drive to tijuana , and get married ? ? ?
i mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant . i love this time of day .
what do you mean ?
i do n't wan na talk about it !
no no no , it 's not sex ! i mean -- it can lead to sex ... but really , it 's just wrestling .
what are you talking about ? ! we just met an hour ago .
do you wan na wrestle ? it 's a good way of breaking the ice . that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together .
excuse me -- ?
okay . you 're probably right .
you 're not dying !
even if i 'm dying -- i still need clean socks .
how can you be so casual ? ? !
no , no ! not yet . i feel bad -- i 've jerked 'em around so many times .
have you told your family ?
they do n't know ... they 've got ta run more tests .
jesus , andy ! can they cure it ?
andy ... there is no real you .
you do n't know the real me .
andy , you 're not horrible . you 're just ... complicated .
i do n't deserve haagen daz . i 'm a horrible person .
i brought you haagen dazs . chocolate .
oh , it 's open .
it 's me .
go away .
i-i 'm sorry . i got caught up in the action ... !
then stop treating me like a fucking prop .
i can shtop whenever i want ...
is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble ? ?
no ! you get in the kitchen . i 'm gon na make you dry my dishes !
ooo , the little lady 's upset . well i say -- get back in the kitchen !
if you want ...
and all this will be for real ?
because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world ! i 'll go in the ring , and i 'll announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me ! then you 'll come up , we 'll wrestle and i 'll let you win ! then you 'll scalp me , and we 'll get married on letterman , like tiny tim did on carson ... right there on the show ! what do you say ? ? ?
why memphis ?
yes .
do i wan na go to memphis and get married ?
do you wan na to go to memphis and get married ?
i 'm here , ai n't i ?
oh ! uh , i hope i did n't offend you .
you were impressed with something . it 's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television .
gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves .
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
hey , i love movie theater popcorn ... but that does n't mean i have to sit through `` on golden pond . ''
andy , the theater 's that way !
i really want one . one large tub of popcorn , please , extra butter .
no thanks .
popcorn ?
no , i 'm sure we 'll be fine .
hi ... am i late ?
hi ...
gosh . gee , lynne ... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves . ext . movie theater - day
why did you call me ? the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you .
hey , i love movie theater popcorn ... but that does n't mean i have to sit through `` on golden pond . ''
andy , the theater 's that way !
i really want one . one large tub of popcorn , please , extra butter .
no thanks .
popcorn ?
no , i 'm sure we 'll be fine .
hi ... am i late ?
hi ...
oh . so you were just pretending to be an asshole .
hey , i hope you did n't take that stuff i said seriously . it was just part of the show ! it 's like the old days , when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd .
buzz off . go patronize somebody else .
gosh , you scored ! look at all those goodies !
do n't touch me !
get off !
i said i did n't want to do the sketch .
go to commercial , man ! get off the stage !
but i do n't do drugs ! and i do n't enjoy making light of them ! i was promised creative control !
do n't worry ! the kids will love it --
you 're not listening to me --
andy , it 'll be fine ! it 's what we 're known for ! `` maui ? `` wowie ! ''
i 'm not comfortable with the last sketch . i do n't do drug humor !
and you 're just poor white trash !
then your father 's a wimp .
my father said i should 've gotten a lawyer -- !
you 're a wimp .
t-there was n't a reason to purposely hurt me --
and you 're just poor white trash !
then your father 's a wimp .
my father said i should 've gotten a lawyer -- !
you 're a wimp .
t-there was n't a reason to purposely hurt me --
no ! no no no ! none of that ! i want this show to be positive !
and you say , `` santa , what am i gettin ' for christmas ? '' and he says , `` cancer ! ''
well , call sag . it 'd be cool to get one on the show . i want the evening to build and build . it 's gon na have the most incredible ending : singers , dancers , the `` hallelujah chorus '' -- then the sky opens , and santa claus comes flying down !
i dunno . if they were , they 'd be pushin ' 80 .
this is great . the crowd 's gon na love this ! hey ... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive ?
yeah , exactly -- `` was '' ! but now , you 're creatively bankrupt . in fact , ladies and gentlemen , kaufman 's so desperate , he paid me to do this tonight ! ! i 'm a plant . it 's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine . is n't that true ? ? ?
i was very original !
who gives a shit ? ! it 's not funny !
hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
sure , because your new stuff 's a bunch of crap . kaufman , people are sick of you . the wrestling ... the hoaxes ...
i , i was asked to do this material - -
yeah , my problem is you 're tired .
sir , do you have a problem ?
it 's working for elvis .
it 's a rave ! boy , if i ever fake my death , they 'll really miss me .
`` ... has been rushed to a nearby hospital , where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis . his parents are at his bedside . fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television 's taxi '' ...
no offense , pal , but i just do n't think you 're built for it . these he- men 'll kick your ass ! ! they 're huge !
you know , i always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler ...
what is this , world war two ... ?
look at this ! an evil russian ! ooo , here 's an evil nazi -- he likes to fight dirty ! hey , here 's an evil japanese guy !
boy , they totally fell for it ! i 'm only acting crazy !
`` was this in actuality andy kaufman ? and if it was andy kaufman , is andy kaufman crazy ? ''
nah . the girls sponge off between johns .
it 's so dirty .
she 'll say , `` now my son is a man . ''
i dunno about this ... what will my mother think ?
they 're asking for it .
no ! andy , do n't do it --
give me the book .
absolutely nothing ! that 's the beauty ! it 's credibility . you make them love you ... and then later , on your special , you 'll screw with their heads !
so ? what do they know ?
are you nuts ? ! 40 million people watch you every week !
each show is worse than the next .
what ? ! ?
i 'm gon na quit .
oh george , this is bob zmuda . bob and i have been buddies for years .
hey andy , good show .
andy , do n't raise your voice . we do n't wish your presence here .
so help me ! all i wan na do is meditate ! !
it is apparently not working .
please ! you 've got to let me take the classes ! it 's how i keep myself balanced ! !
the wrestling ... the sexist remarks ... the foul language ... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual . it seems you have no respect for anything .
`` philosophically '' ?
yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to tm . but we feel that perhaps ... you and the program have grown apart philosophically .
why ? ? i ... i attend every year .
this is very difficult for me to say ... but -- perhaps it would be best if you did n't attend the retreat .
yes , your holiness ?
excuse me , andy ...
we are all impressed .
i stopped drinking . i gave up drugs . and i 'm meditating three hours a day . it 's the center of my life ...
goals are important .
um , yes . i have n't fought with them , since i started here .
are you at peace with your family ?
doctor , i think i need a neck brace .
it 's probably just a strained muscle .
but my neck hurts ... and i have a slight cough ...
positive .
are you sure ?
i do n't see any injury to your neck , mr. kaufman .
sure it is . tony called me himself . he yelled at me , insisting that his dressing room be bigger than andy 's . they 're both going on tonight , believe me !
yeah , i know what i said ! but -- trust me , it 's not gon na happen !
why 's that ? you said over and over and over , tony clifton is not andy kaufman --
gene , you misunderstood ! ! you 're not getting both of them ! it 's physically impossible !
i 'll take my chances ! !
no , i 'm serious . if you book tony , do not expect to get andy .
yeah , yeah , yeah . i know ! wink wink ! nudge nudge !
look -- i got ta be clear with you . tony clifton is not andy kaufman .
eh , sure . we 're trying to expand our audience base -- and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman .
really ? ! you want tony clifton to headline harrah 's tahoe ? ?
oh .
ehh -- andy does n't really like playing casinos . the audiences do n't work well for him .
i got a contract ! ! i 'm gon na take you to the department of labor !
get off my stage ! you 're fired !
i do n't know nothin ' about no kaufman . he 's been ridin ' my coattails , smearing my reputation . been usin ' my good name , to get places .
yeah ! ! i talked to andy kaufman !
i do n't know what yer talkin ' about . you musta talked to someone else --
we had a deal ! !
andy , i 'm calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry . but -- i need your permission to fire him .
`` burlesque '' ?
kaufman 's a lying bastard ! if you sign him , i 'll ruin you !
look ... i do n't know what your problem is ...
who is this ? tony clifton you -- you know damn straight who it is . tony clifton ! a name to respect . a name to fear . beer . gear . deer . ear .
yeah ! you stay away from that andy kaufman , if you know what 's good for you !
can i help you with something ?
`` speaking '' ! reeking , seeking , creaking ... freaking !
er , yes . speaking .
uh , yeah . is this george shapiro ?
yeah . they do n't know whether to be sad , or angry .
it 's a perfect kaufman audience .
what are ya talkin ' about ? ! i was the one saying i did n't believe it !
if i find out you 're behind this , i 'll kill you .
forget it . it 's in terrible taste ! i want nothing to do with this .
hey , that 's good ! we can make that play . and we 'll really drag it out . you get better , you get worse ... you die ...
i used to think you were original .
why ... ? andy , why ... ?
wow , you ca n't buy this kind of publicity !
yeah , he 's just laying low , waitin ' for his comeback . god , listen to this ! `` it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual ... ''
but what 's the point ? how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world ?
sure ! but we think it 's kickass ! now i get to be tony . i get to dump the glass of water on someone else 's head !
so you 've got this big elaborate joke , which is really only funny to two people in the universe . you ... and you .
bob , andy needs to relax . see if you can get him away from all this . take him to hawaii , or bali ... find something special . something nice ...
is n't tony clifton going on taxi soon ? maybe that 'll chill him out .
i 'm worried about andy . his stress level is affecting his work .
do n't believe everything you hear .
so your name 's not gorsky .
that was a really hot house !
why is n't he moving ? ?
jesus christ ! ! ! ! !
they 're gon na lynch him !
why is he saying these things ? !
who knows ? ! that kid is totally meshuga .
what 's in memphis ?
he said he 's coming back !
hmph ! they sure did n't give andy much to do .
there !
where ?
i saw michael !
of course he 's in his room . all his `` friends '' are in there .
is he in his room ?
see , that 's exactly what i 'm talkin ' about ! here ! i 'll give you a little humor !
a -- a tourist .
shut up ! i hate them polish jokes !
it 's my name .
are you tryin ' to do some of that polack humor ? well if that 's so , you can just get the hell out of this restaurant !
yes .
`` gorsky '' ? what is that , polish ?
bob gorsky .
`` bob '' ? bob ! bob bob bob . bob what ?
bob .
what 's your name ?
sure ...
know what ?
you do n't know .
we have no choice but to continue as planned . deploy the sentinels . immediately .
they are dead . in either case --
it 's already begun .
we 'll need a search running .
their next target . the name is neo .
expect it . did you get anything from the room ?
he 'll be contacting us again .
does that surprise you ? it was inevitable .
then the informant is real .
you all look the same to me .
smith . i am agent smith .
and you are ?
the great morpheus . we meet at last .
they wo n't make it .
hurry !
the sewers . of course .
no , lieutenant , your men are already dead .
i sent two units . they 're bringing her down now .
the orders were for your protection .
i 'm just doing my job . you gim me that juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass .
lieutenant , you were given specific orders --
oh shit .
lieutenant ?
oh , god .
what ? !
should tank i.d . it ?
that 's the third white van i 've seen .
what ?
weird .
no way . not possible .
he 's gon na make it .
all the time . it 's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly .
you ever have the feeling that you 're not sure if you 're awake or still dreaming ?
i do n't know ... my computer ...
something wrong , man ? you look a little whiter than usual .
right ...
i know , i know . this never happened . you do n't exist .
if you get caught using that --
hallelujah ! you are my savior , man ! my own personal jesus christ !
two grand .
you got the money ?
i know . it 's her fault .
you 're two hours late .
it 's choi .
who is it ?
no !
... yes .
do n't hate me , trinity . i 'm just the messenger . and right now i 'm going to prove it to you .
goddamn you , cypher !
that 's what you think . they 've promised to back me , trinity . they 're going to reinsert my body . i 'll go back to sleep and when i wake up , i 'll be fat and rich and i wo n't remember a goddamn thing . it 's the american dream .
but you 're out , cypher . you ca n't go back .
oh , i disagree , trinity . i disagree . i think the matrix is more real than this world . i mean , all i do is pull a plug here . but there , you watch a man die .
the matrix is n't real !
yes . you see , the truth is , trinity , that we humans have a place in the future . but it 's not here . it 's in the matrix .
my god . morpheus . you gave them morpheus .
i 'm tired , trinity . i 'm tired of this war , i 'm tired of fighting . i 'm tired of this ship , of being cold , of eating the same fucking goop every day . but most of all , i 'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit .
you killed them .
you are a beautiful woman . too bad things had to work out like this .
an accident ? !
he had an accident .
cypher ? where 's tank ?
hello , trinity .
morpheus will take him when he 's ready .
i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure , why does n't he take him to the oracle ? she would know .
do n't tell me you 're a believer now ?
there 's something about him , is n't there ?
yeah , 'course i 'm sure .
are you sure this line is clean ?
hear what ?
did you hear that ?
i intend to , believe me . someone has to .
if you have something to say , i suggest you say it to morpheus .
you do n't , do you ?
i ... it does n't matter what i believe .
do you ?
morpheus believes he is the one .
we 're going to kill him . do you understand that ? he 's going to die just like the others .
do n't be ridiculous .
i know but i felt like taking a shift .
you were n't supposed to relieve me .
any time .
thanks ... for the drink .
honestly . morpheus . he got them all amped up believing in bullshit . i watched each of them take on an agent and i watched each of them die . little piece of advice : you see an agent , you do what we do ; run . run your ass off .
how ?
dead . all dead .
what happened to them ?
five . since i 've been here .
how many were there ?
you bet your ass . it keeps him going . maybe it keeps all of us going .
really ?
i 'm going to let you in on a little secret here . now do n't tell him i told you this , but this ai n't the first time morpheus thought he found the one .
gee-zus ! what a mindfuck . you 're here to save the world . you got ta be shitting me . what do you say to something like that ?
... yeah .
why you 're here ?
have to . the image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there 's way too much information to decode the matrix . you get used to it , though . your brain does the translating . i do n't even see the code . all i see is blonde , brunette , and redhead . you want a drink ?
do you always look at it encoded ?
the matrix ? yeah .
is that ... ?
midnight watch .
what are you doing ?
no , it 's all right .
sorry .
whoa ! shit , neo , you scared the bejeezus out of me .
he 's going to pop !
i do n't believe it ! i do n't believe it !
nearest exit is franklin and erie . an old appliance store .
just get me outta here .
i got you .
there was an accident . a fucking car accident . all of a sudden . boom . jesus , someone 's going to make a believer out of me .
cypher ?
i need an exit ! fast !
operator .
i know , trinity . do n't worry . he 's going to make it .
you ca n't use that until neo is out !
five minutes . maybe six .
how long ?
he 's beginning to believe .
what is he doing ?
we have no choice .
they 'll be able to track it .
give me your phone .
what if he is n't the one , morpheus ? how can you be so sure ?
we found him , trinity . we finally found him .
shit ! apoc ?
i got a fibrillation !
go .
all right --
you have to focus . there is a phone . wells and lake . you can make it .
goddamnit !
yes .
are they any agent ?
i know . they cut the hardline . this line is not a viable exit .
she told you exactly what you needed to hear . that 's all . sooner or later , neo , you 're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path .
morpheus , the oracle ... she told me --
trinity ! go ! get to the basement . find the catch basin !
no . no ! morpheus ! do n't !
i know . that is why it is so important for you to go . please , neo , i 'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me .
morpheus , i do n't know --
listen to me , neo . i know why you 're afraid to go through that door . you ca n't get free of thinking that i could be wrong . you must believe me . there is a greatness inside of you , neo . a greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world .
no . i did not . i have never told anyone this , neo . after i saw the oracle i thought ... no , i misunderstood what she told me . i believed that it was all about me . that i would find the one , not that he would find me .
did you believe in them too ?
yeah ? what about the other five guys ? the five before me ? what about them ?
yes i do .
and you still believe i 'm the one ?
faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots . these things are not a matter of cause and effect , neo . i do not believe things with my mind . i believe them with my heart . in my gut .
why ? so i can hear some old lady tell me , what ? that i 'm this guy that everybody 's been waiting for ? the one that 's supposed to save the world ? come on . how do i respond to that ? i ca n't . it 's ridiculous . i mean who am i ? i 'm nobody , i 'm just a guy . what did i do , morpheus ? why me ?
that 's why we 're here .
what do i believe it ? are you kidding me ? what do you think ? i 'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real , was n't . the whole world , my entire life was a lie . i do n't know anything anymore , morpheus .
what do you believe in ?
i told you i do n't believe in this stuff . no matter what she says i 'm not going to believe it , so what 's the point ?
why ?
morpheus , i do n't think this is a good idea .
that i would find the one .
what did she tell you ?
yes .
she helped you ?
do n't think of it in terms of right and wrong . she is a guide , neo . she can help you find the path .
and she 's never wrong .
she is a true psychic . she sees beyond the relativity of time . for her there is no past , present or future . there is only what is .
how does she know ?
she would say she knows enough .
and she knows what ? everything ?
of the resistance .
the beginning ?
yes . she 's very old . she 's been with us since the beginning .
so is this the same oracle that made the , uh , prophecy ?
what 's going on ?
set down in there .
no , neo . i 'm trying to tell you that when you 're ready , you wo n't have to .
what ? are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets ?
i 've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall . men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air . yet as powerful as they are , their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world . because of this , they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be .
how ?
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure . only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one . unkillable . but now i believe that is going to change .
look again .
yeah .
no you do n't . did you see the woman in the red dress ?
i think i do .
do you understand , neo ?
what -- what lesson ?
this is another matrix simulation . a training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson .
the body can not live without the mind .
if you are killed in the matrix , you die here ?
your mind makes it real .
i thought it was n't real .
because ... i did n't think i would ?
do you know why you did n't make it ?
i 'm trying to free your mind , neo , but all i can do is show you the door . you 're the one that has to step through . tank , load the jump program .
i know what you 're trying to do --
do you think my being faster , stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place ?
you -- you 're too fast .
how did i beat you ?
show me .
this is incredible . i know kung fu .
your training .
for what ?
get some rest . you 're going to need it .
i did n't say that it would be easy , neo . i just said that it would be the truth .
no ! i do n't believe it ! it 's not possible !
yes . a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines . i must say i find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back , toasting the new age . i say almost funny .
a.i. ? you mean artificial intelligence ?
we have only bits and pieces of information . what we know for certain is that , at some point in the early twenty-first century , all of mankind was united in celebration . through the blinding inebriation of hubris , we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to a.i .
what is real ? how do you define real ? if you 're talking about your senses , what you feel , taste , smell , or see , then all you 're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain .
this is n't real ?
wild , is n't it ?
right now , we 're inside a computer program ?
you believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. i ca n't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know .
when ?
more important than what is when ?
morpheus , what 's happened to me ? what is this place ?
you 've never used them before .
why do my eyes hurt ?
your muscles have atrophied . we 're rebuilding them .
what are you doing ?
far from it .
... am i dead ?
be what ? be real ?
this ca n't be ...
have you ever had a dream , neo , that you were so sure was real ?
what does that mean ?
the pill you took is part of a trace program . it 's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location .
that you are a slave , neo . like everyone else , you were born into bondage , kept inside a prison that you can not smell , taste , or touch . a prison for your mind .
what truth ?
the matrix is everywhere , it 's all around us , here even in this room . you can see it out your window or on your television . you feel it when you go to work , or go to church or pay your taxes . it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth .
do you want to know what it is ?
the matrix ?
let me tell you why you are here . you have come because you know something . what you know you ca n't explain but you feel it . you 've felt it your whole life , felt that something is wrong with the world . you do n't know what , but it 's there like a splinter in your mind , driving you mad . it is this feeling that brought you to me . do you know what i 'm talking about ?
i know exactly what you mean .
because i do n't like the idea that i 'm not in control of my life .
why not ?
no .
yes . thank you . but i think we both know there 's more to it than that . do you believe in fate , neo ?
you 're morpheus , you 're a legend . most hackers would die to meet you .
ironically , this is not far from the truth . but i 'm getting ahead of myself . can you tell me , neo , why are you here ?
i can see it in your eyes . you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up .
you could say that .
i imagine , right now , you must be feeling a bit like alice , tumbling down the rabbit hole ?
please . come . sit .
it 's an honor .
welcome , neo . as you no doubt have guessed , i am morpheus .
go the the adams street bridge .
... yes .
do you still want to meet ?
you 're the one , neo . you see , you may have spent the last few years looking for me , but i 've spent most of my life looking for you .
what do you know ?
they got to you first , but they 've underestimated how important you are . if they knew what i know , you would probably be dead .
the agents --
this line is tapped so i must be brief .
there are only two ways out of this building . one is that scaffold . the other is in their custody . you take a chance either way . i leave it to you .
no way , no way , this is crazy .
there 's a small ledge . it 's a short climb . you can make it .
no ! it 's too far away .
how do you know all this ?
good . now there is a window . open it .
go ! now !
but what if ... ?
the cubicle across from you is empty .
i can guide you out , but you have to do exactly what i say .
how ? !
i 'm not sure , but if you do n't want to find out , you better get out of there .
what the fuck do they want with me ? !
yes .
holy fucking shit !
yes . now .
right now ?
stand up and see for yourself .
who 's coming for me ?
i 've been looking for you , neo . i do n't know if you 're ready to see what i want to show you , but unfortunately , we have run out of time . they 're coming for you , neo . and i 'm not sure what they 're going to do .
morpheus ...
hello , neo . do you know who this is ?
hello ?
he is the one . he is the one !
how ... ? !
do it !
i 'm going to make the call .
yes , sir .
tank , charge the e.m.p .
we 're on our way --
got one ready , sir . subway . state and balbo .
we need an exit .
goddamn ! it 's good to hear your voice , sir !
tank .
good .
now left and that 's it in front of you .
i need the main wet-wall .
got it .
ten hours straight . he 's a machine .
how is he ?
you 're going to have to make a final choice . in one hand , you will have morpheus ' life . in the other hand , you will have your own . one of you is going to die . which one , will be up to you .
what ?
morpheus believes in you , neo and no one , not you or even me can convince him otherwise . he believes it so blindly that he 's going to sacrifice his life to save yours .
what do you mean , without him ?
i know . poor morpheus . without him we are lost . we will never find the one .
morpheus . he almost had me convinced .
what 's funny ?
your next life , maybe . who knows . that 's how these things go .
what ?
sorry , kid . you got the gift but looks like you 're waiting for something .
i 'm not the one .
but you already know what i 'm going to tell you .
but what ?
okay , now i 'm supposed to say , 'hmmm , that 's interesting but ... ' then you say --
honestly ? i do n't know .
so ? what do you think ? you think you 're the one ?
not too bright though .
who ?
you 're cuter than i thought . i see why she likes you .
how did you know ... ?
i said do n't worry about it . i 'll get one of my kids to fix it .
shit , i 'm sorry .
that vase .
what vase ?
i 'd ask you to sit down , but you 're not going to anyway . and do n't worry about the vase .
yeah .
bingo . not quite what you were expecting , right ? i got to say i love seeing you non-believers . always a pip . almost done . smell good , do n't they ?
you 're the oracle ?
i know . you 're neo . be right with you .
hello ?
not yet .
can you fly that thing .
i 'm fine . come on , we have to keep moving .
are you all right ?
it was n't fast enough .
you moved like they moved . i 've never seen anyone move that fast .
do what ?
neo , how did you do that ?
yeah ?
no one has ever done anything like this .
no ? let me tell you what i believe . i believe morpheus means more to me than he does to you . i believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since i am the ranking officer on this ship , if you do n't like it then i believe that you can go to hell , because you are n't going anywhere else .
no , you 're not .
i 'm coming with you .
what are you doing ?
i believe i can bring him back .
what ?
because ...
why ?
no , neo . that 's not true . it ca n't be true .
i 'm sorry , i 'm not . i 'm just another guy . morpheus is the one that matters .
no , you ... have to be .
i 'm not the one , trinity . the oracle hit me with that too .
what ?
morpheus did what he did because he believed that i 'm something i 'm not .
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out ! there 's no way you 're going back in !
i have to .
you ca n't !
i 'm going in after him .
what are you doing ?
what choice ?
that i would have to make a choice ...
there has to be something that we can do .
goddamnit ! goddamnit !
i do n't know . it just went dead .
what happened ?
is morpheus still alive , tank ?
is morpheus alive ?
we have to !
we ca n't leave him !
go !
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix . it happens when they change something .
what is it ?
it might have been . i 'm not sure .
how much like it ? was it the same cat ?
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it .
what happened ? what did you see ?
nothing . just had a little deja vu .
what did you just say ?
... right as rain .
are you all right ?
she told me ...
what did she tell you ?
yes .
did you go to her ?
no .
should i be ?
are you worried ?
is it ?
that 's different .
but an oracle can .
that the matrix can not tell you who you are .
what does that mean ?
i used to eat there ... really good noodles .
what ?
god ...
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius . it 's the only weapon we have against the machines .
e.m.p . an electromagnetic pulse .
easy , neo . easy .
get this thing out of me !
it 's going into replication .
uh-oh ...
we think you 're bugged . try to relax .
what is this thing ?
... shit .
and i know that 's not where you want to be .
because you 've been down there , neo . you already know that road . you know exactly where it ends .
why ?
neo , please , you have to trust me .
from you .
from what ?
it 's necessary , neo . for our protection .
what the hell is this ? !
when i asked him , he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question . they have to see it to believe it .
what is the matrix ?
it 's the question that brought you here . you know the question just as i did . it is a hacker 's question .
please . just listen . i know why you 're here , neo . i know why you left your family and your friends , why you left your home to come to this city . you 're looking for him .
who is ?
they 're watching you , neo .
of what ?
right now , all i can tell you , is that you are in danger . i brought you here to warn you .
how did you do that ?
no . it 's safe here and i do n't have much time .
do you want to go somewhere and talk ?
most guys do .
i just thought ... you were a guy .
what ?
gee-zus .
that was a long time ago .
trinity ? the trinity ? the trinity that cracked the i.r.s . kansas city d-base ?
my name is trinity .
who are you ?
i know a lot about you . i 've been wanting to meet you for some time .
how do you know that name ?
hello , neo .
kick it in ! kick it in !
it 's locked .
duck !
which way ? which way ?
mr. wizard , get me the fuck out of here !
operator .
guns . lots of guns .
okay . store 's open . what do you need ? besides a miracle ...
because i believe in something .
why ?
i know that 's what it looks like , but it 's not . i ca n't logically explain to you why it 's not . morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed . i understand that now . that 's why i have to go .
neo , this is loco . they 've got morpheus in a military-controlled building . even if you somehow got inside , those are agents holding him . three of them ! i want morpheus back , too , but what you are talking about is suicide .
the oracle . she told me this would happen . she told me ...
what are you talking about ?
does it ? i do n't know . this ca n't be just coincidence . it ca n't be ! can it ?
neo , this has to be done !
goddamnit ! i do n't believe this is happening !
every leader of every ship is given the codes to zion 's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the matrix . they are used only in emergencies . if an agent had those codes and got inside zion 's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system . it would be the end of everything .
what do they want ?
when it does , morpheus will tell them anything they want to know .
depends on the mind . but eventually , it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this .
how much time ?
they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems . it 's like cracking a computer . all it takes is time .
how ?
they 're hacking his mind .
what are they doing to him ?
the oracle .
see who ?
hell yes !
hey , mikey , he likes it ! ready for more ?
holy shit !
deep underground . near the earth 's core , where it 's still warm . you live long enough , you might even see it .
where is it ?
the last human city . the only place we got left .
it 's a city ?
if this war ended tomorrow , zion is where the party would be .
zion ?
any holes ? nope . me and my brother dozer , we are 100 percent pure , old- fashioned , home-grown human . born free . right here in the real world . genuine child of zion .
you do n't have ...
you will tonight . i guarantee it . i 'm tank . i 'll be your operator .
no .
morning . did you sleep ?
hurry , neo .
they 've burned through the outer shields .
i do n't know . i lost him .
what just happened ?
i ca n't !
an agent ! you have to send me back !
what the hell just happened ?
neo !
tank , i need a pilot program for a military m-109 helicopter .
operator .
trinity , we do n't have any other choice .
you 're going to kill him ? kill morpheus ? !
there is . we have to pull the plug .
dozer ?
i 'll be all right .
tank , you 're hurt .
got it .
so did we . i sent him to franklin and erie .
cypher , i thought --
you 're not far from cypher .
we need an exit !
he 's alive .
yes . they 're moving him . i do n't know where yet .
tank , it 's me .
operator .
let go of her .
whether she wants to or not ... she 's not going .
nothing 's private ...
look fella ... this is private ...
it 's obvious that the girl does n't want to accompany you , is n't it ?
of course , 'the season of the witch ' wo n't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch .

'thou sayest it ; i am a king . this is why i was born and why i have come into this world , to bear witness to the truth . everyone who is of the truth hears my voice . '
'thou art then a king ? '
'my kingdom is not of this world . if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews . but , as it is my kingdom is not from here . '
'dost thou say this of thyself , or have others told thee of me ? '
'art thou the king of the jews ' ?
salute ! ! !
'and with your spirit . '
may god be with you .
anybody wan na have a game ?

you are with out a doubt the biggest , most pretentious bullshit thrower i know . like to see what kind of business you 'd do .

'take a little tip from mack the knife ... '

be careful .
really wanted to get a little tiger charlie , y'know ... a little william blake and all that ...
do n't go to any trouble . we believe you ... we believe you .
keep quiet about this . i do n't have any license for him yet . i 've only had him a couple of days . nobody can feed him except me . i 'm the only one he trusts . watch .
johnny , you 're a real jerk-off .
you got some mouth !
i bet 235. because i dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died , the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when i dreamt ...
it 'll be ok - i know those guys . they wo n't stiff you .
the number was 235 - i bet it combination .
next time , bet with your own kind .
not quite ... but keep trying .
waddaya think ?
good idea .
what are you going to do ? hide me ?
forget it .
this ca n't be settled any other way now ... i 'll take full blame .
no .
i think we should see your uncle .
he has about twenty-eight bucks ... it 's all he has on him .
hello , michael . i 've got something for you ... not much ... but ...

do n't you move ! ! !
come on .
no , i just want to help myself , that 's all .

charlie , twenty-eight bucks is nothing . the only way to do it is through your uncle ... think about it will you ?
oh , cut it out , will ya ?
no you 're not ...
take it . i 'm doing it for you , stupid !
what you 're doing for me is n't worth it ... believe me !
you threaten me with my uncle ? after what i 'm doing for you ?
me ? i would n't say a word to my aunt and uncle ... or even your uncle , charlie ...
johnny , i swear to god , if you open your mouth about any of this ...
i 'm not smart ... i 'm stupid , remember . i 'm so stupid that you have to look out for me , remember ?

yeah , teresa , shut up ! we do n't wan na get charlie here in trouble , do we ? ... we love charlie .
shut up !
you tell me that in front of these creeps ?
keep your mouth shut .
i understand .
that 's what i get for getting involved . look , on pay-day at least show up at tony 's place to meet him , ok ? this way he does n't think that you 're trying to screw him . if you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he 'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something ... understand ? i 'm not asking i 'm telling you ! !
yeah , take it easy . will you relax .
i do n't get involved with anything , you understand that ? nothing ! i 'm clean as far as you know ... right ?
that 'll help you out fine . that 's the best way for you , not for me ! i swear to god , i 'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this . you understand ? i do n't care what happens , he does n't find out .
if you had a little talk with your uncle ... if anybody can do it , he can .
how ?
charlie , you know the best way to take care of this whole mess .
big deal ... in the meantime , it 's done ... i 'll still try to help you out ... you know that ... but you got ta show some effort ... some respect ... understand ?
i 'm sorry charlie ... i did n't mean it .
it 's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now ... the interest is going up ... $ 3,000 ... do you realize that , flash ?
i 'm going to work this week ... i mean it .
that 's not going to help .
i swear to god charlie ... my arm still hurts from the car accident ... that 's why i did n't go to work . i swear it .

i should know ? his wife do n't even know . probably off with one of his little girls ... i do n't know . i tell you , if he do n't give a damn , then i do n't give a damn ... why should i kill myself ?
i do n't understand , where 's groppi ?
your uncle 's a good man ... i wo n't stick him . either he gets the money or the place and right now he 's getting the place . and tell me why should i care ? i got a partner who 's a bum , who does n't help out ... who disappears and leaves me with all the problems . i should go back to florida ... i do n't need this .
he 'd rather have the loan payed , you know that .
listen , i should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him , you know that . i do n't need this aggravation . i 'm getting old .
not next week 's either ... listen ... you tell that to giovanni , not me .
i ca n't make this week 's payment and if this keeps up not next week 's either .

we 'll be here .
be seeing you and johnny tonight ... here ... right ?
you said it .
'amen i say to thee , thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny . '
he could at least show some respect and show his face , even if he does n't have the money ...
'but i say to you not to resist the evildoer ; on the contrary , if someone takes thy tunic , let him take thy cloak as well ... to him who asks of thee , give ; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away !
i 'll tell you who you can pray for ... next payday , i 'll be at tony 's place ... johnny better show or i find him and break his legs ... and i mean it .
'but i say to you , love your enemies , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who persecute ... '
charlie , this is business .
$ 3,000 . shit ! can we hold it at $ 3,000 ?
$ 500 . he borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans ... now , counting the interest ... it 's almost $ 3,000 .

hostess ?
no ... no stripping ... as the hostess .
stripper ?
i was thinking maybe you 'd do very nicely for the place .
that 's nice .
in a little while ... i 'm gon na have the opportunity of opening my own place ... not here ... much nicer than this ... uptown ... sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything .
i know .
no , i 'm serious ... you 're really good .
fine .
you know diane ... i 've been wanting to talk to you for a while now ... er ... a ... aside from all that joking around we do out there ... when you 're on ... i ... a ... i really ... think that you 're a terrific performer ...
fine .
diane , how are you feeling ?
oh yeah , that 's a possibility .
well , maybe you missed something ?
all right .
who knows ? it 's not hard to figure out what she 'll wind up like . when the respect for parents breaks down , that 's bad ... you know i 'm `` cumpari '' with them ... so i take an interest . you live next door , keep an eye open ... but do n't get involved .
what do they expect you to say ?
her mother and father come to me and ask advice ... she wants to leave ... get her own apartment ... worries them sick ... what am i gon na tell them ? lock her up ?
yeah . that 's what i said , sick in the head .
no , she 's got epilepsy .
... the one who 's sick , right ? in the head .
teresa .
his whole family has problems ... his cousin , the girl who lives next door to you ...
what did he do ?
... but it 's the same thing , all the same ... they 're in there by having something on somebody ... and when that does n't work ... they fight ... our life has honor ... we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do . they know where to come when they need us . i realize this during the war ... world war ii ... vito genovese ... during wwii he worked with the government , taking care of the docks ...
what i do n't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you 're gon na read anyway .
oh yes , he 's pretty good .
you know , this boy over here , once , long time ago , tried to enrich my mind ... so he gives me a book by this hemin fella ... to read , so i read it .
hemmingway . killed himself . i was more upset about that than about groppi , that 's for sure .
well , he was always a little crazy ... he puts a gun in his mouth ... ... like your friend ... comme si chiama ... henning ? heming ?
i really could n't believe it when you told me , you know that ?
our friend , groppi , went to his mother 's house . and when he was there ... at night ...
who me ? ... no , i do n't know , not me ... all i know is ...
you heard what happened to groppi , eh ?
oh ... around ... why ?
hey , where you been ?
ok .
take a drink !
no ... his business is bad . but i 'll decide what to do and you ... and you just keep out of anything that might ... might ... er draw attention to you .
about oscar ... i think he put on this act ... about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that . he ca n't make the payments ... i do n't know what to make of it . he says groppi 's run off with a girl . i could help if you want .
yes , you did .
you 're right uncle . i must have gotten it confused with something else .
no you were n't .
about that shooting last night ... i was there and ...
fine . did you have a good time last night ?
uncle , how are you feeling ?
oh , that 's ok ... i 've been in and out of this place fifty times .
why do n't you take a look around the place if you want ?
charlie , couple of courses is n't enough to get you student deferred ... i mean if they wanted to draft you , you would 've been drafted by now .
it 's only a couple of courses ... just for the draft .
oh yeah ... did n't read it but i saw the movie ... gregory peck ... pretty good .
`` short happy life of francis macomber . ''
wha ?
`` francis macomber . ''
no , c'mon ... y'know , i read .
nothing .
what was it ?
was n't a book ... was a short story .
for god 's sakes ... i told you before ... nothing . charlie , i ca n't stay in here too long at this hour ... will you please listen to me ?
are you sure he did n't say anything to you about tonight ?
but ...
honey , i ca n't talk now ... i 've got ta run , bye .
charlie ... i 've got to see you . i want to talk ...
teresa ? ... yeah , charlie . listen , i 'm looking for your cousin . yeah , well today 's tuesday , payday . i have n't seen him all day ... no ... well , have you got any idea where he is ? i know it 's early yet but i 'm just getting worried that 's all ...
now do n't get excited . do n't get excited ! !
the building on the corner . that one ! he 's been on the roof a half hour now !
the green capsules in the top drawer .
you 've been running round too much . bet you 've been forgetting your medicine .
i 'm sleepy .
of all people . now say the truth . do i look like che guevara . c'mon .
ummmmmmmmmmmmm .
... he must have heard the name from those t.v . 's in the hall that were blaring all the time . i remember guevara was in town at the time . must 've heard it from there i guess ... but that 's funny , is n't it ?
i know ... i know .
i can take care of myself . you know that .
well you ca n't blame them in a way .
you know why ... with my parents .
uhuh ... probably a good idea . why do n't you do it this time ?
i 'm going to take that apartment uptown .
watch your language .
you 're intolerable today .
that w.a.s.p . bastard .
no . of course he lives there . would i point it out to you if he did n't ?
sure ... he lives there ?
see that ... know who lives there ? the name george earhardt mean anything to you ?
that 's the word ... preoccupied .
i know you do n't . you 've been very preoccupied lately .
take your time . i do n't care .
it was nothing . i 'm almost finished .
yeah ... but do n't worry about that now . the hemmingway one is first .
a paper on that one too ?
bore .
ok .
no ... we can come back in a couple of weeks . besides , if we 're both gone for three days it would n't look right .
c'mon charlie ... one more day . i 'll call in sick for work .
not sick ... just stupid . speaking of stupid , your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother 's house ... to get some food .
it 's still sick .
you missed the point . the kid 's a climber ... not very bright ... but if you get down to his level to look at it his way ; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation . he thinks he 's in good standing .
it does n't make any sense . he would n't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy ... not unless it was personal .
christ , you should have seen it . unbelievable . the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin . that kid was scared . not half as much as we were though .
no .
did you ?
alright ... hey , did you hear any more about what happened last night ?
do n't ask .
what is it now ?
you know ... like restaurants , night clubs ...
anything specific ?
see if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws ... or proprietorship ... you know ... at your place .
nobody knows anything , believe me .
charlie ... ?
maybe , who knows .
an apartment uptown ? downtown ?
well , if things go the way i hope they 'll go , this money business will take care of itself . god willing .
it 's all right .
sure ... it 's not that ... i mean ...
i do n't mind .
well ...
please take it .
here .
well ... with the hotel that 's ten ... fifteen ...
do you have enough ?
ok , we 'll go for lunch .
i 'd like to eat something before i go back to work .
hey , c'mon - no bullshit - friends .
count it .
do n't count it ... it 's all there .
i feel fine -- nothing wrong with me .
what 's the matter with this kid ?
girls ? you call those skanks girls ? !
the girls like it loud .
lower the fuckin music -- i ca n't hear nothin .
shut up .
scumbag --
we 'll close up as soon as everybody leaves .
will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers . tony , you gon na close the place , we get out of here , get something to eat , or what ?
yeah , so things 'll be even .
put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one .
which one , the big tab or the little tab ?
and a double for you and charlie here . and put it on my tab , willya ?
this is a heisted car !
you could say that .
you mean it 's heisted .
well ... no .
yeah , it 's your father 's .

i know what you 're going to say but do n't say it . these drinks are all on the tab . i 'm gon na see you this tuesday payday , i promise . i give you my word .
of course ! a double for michael , tony .
how about me ? i do n't get a drink john ?
ok guys ... have a heart . this is my business .
yeah .
thanks .
sure .
can you spare it ?
not bad . $ 20 . here , $ 5 .
how much ?
have n't you had enough of us , dad ?
dinner ? again ?
yeah , speak for yourself .
look who 's talking .
you think so ?
-- but he does seem very nice .
... i do n't know , daddy seems funny to me . ever since joe showed . it 's like he dropped from the clouds ...
nothing 's going on . maybe he does n't want to be alone . he 's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
... we 're never all together two nights in a row . maybe christmas , thanksgiving , that 's it . what 's going on ?
and is n't it a lovely one ? so sturdy , so straight --
that 's your name ?
... i 'm here , are n't i ? would n't miss a loose end meeting . what 's on the table for discussion ? party favors , flowers -- hi dad , hi drew --
you ate ?
hi , everybody . sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
drew called from the astar , they 're still two minutes away .
i 'm allison , you 're 'honey ' .
well , maybe next time joe goes , he 'll take us along .
did he ? that 's more than we get to do .
very .
he 's cute .
that was 'joe ' .
love that name .
just plain 'joe ' ?
yeah , bill , the suspense is killing me .
daddy ! come on , a name .
unfortunately . i sat between them at the bronx zoo benefit -- it was better than seconal .
his wife ?
he 's coming .
did you speak to the governor ?
yes , it is .
you know , darling , this is going to be a wonderful party .
but that 's what you were thinking . and that 's okay . because i know you love me . not like it is with susan , the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you , as opposed to me when i walk in a room and that look comes over your face , `` what does she want now ? ''
i was n't going to say --
that you 've been to susan ?
i have n't been the father to you that --
they respect you . is n't that a kind of love ?
yeah ? and what about my enemies ?
i do it because i love you . because everybody i loved you . mommy -- wher- ever she is -- susan , quince , the people who work for you , everybody who 's ever known you .
-- plus we 've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from the russian tea room . i 've dressed him in a cossack shirt and he 'll sing nelson eddy songs .
do they , m'dear ?
the fountain is the caspian sea and the sea is serving up caviar . the 'b 's for beluga , the 'p ' for petrossian . of course , they also stand for 'bill ' and for 'parrish ' .
it 's starting to grow on me . but what do the 'b ' and 'p ' mean ?
hi , daddy , what do you think ?
'goddam party ' !
oh , the goddam party --
it 's for the party , dad --
i do n't like cake .
from la rosette , only the greatest pastry chef in america . this is orange , from real seville oranges . lemon , on a mille-feuille crust , a little on the fanciful . and a while , nothing like a good old white cake , vanilla , with angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in .
who 's annie ?
annie made them .
what is this ?
that 's okay , daddy .
i like it . i like it . i 'm sorry i do n't seem more appreciative .
you know , we 're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not .
of course .
whatever it was , they 'll be here . we sent out invitations to everyone , plane tickets included -- the rsvp 's are amazing . a few of them we did n't hear from , and some of them are dead , of course --
conflict , honey . korean conflict .
from the korean war .
who ?
did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming ?
we 've got some things to discuss .
now , i 'm getting interested . i want to know more -- -
whew , at last . nice to meet you , mr. black .
-- black .
a name ?
daddy . does your friend have a name ?
good . songs . what songs should sidney -- pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play ?
oh , you could n't be more wrong , sweetheart . i can ' tell you how much i appreciate it and how i 'm looking forward to it .
and you could care less --
i know you do , darling .
i lay awake nights in a cold sweat , i want this party to be like some- thing mom would have made for you , i want it to be perfect --
what , honey ?
no .
is n't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it .
calm down , daddy , you 'll see , you 're going to love it .
i hate parties --
but it 's your birthday .
allison , i trust you . this is your thing .
fireworks . update -- we 're con- structing the number '65 ' on the barge , archers from the state college at new paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it , when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a viking funeral with none of the morbidity ... the hudson river authority says , for you , they 'll make a special dispensation - of course there 'll be an overtime bill for the poughkeepsie fire dept ...
not much more . big day in the big city . what 's on your mind ?
have you got a minute ?
hi , allison --
daddy !
what will i tell annie ?
but what ?
yeah , but --
you know what i 'm saying , joe ?
honey -- !
yeah , they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then luisa hits it again in the kitchen .
paillarde of veal .
no jocks ? a twenty-game winner or a masters champion ? someone i could talk to . or would talk to me .
please do n't be negative , drew , we have an acceptance list that would do the white house proud -- the secretary-general of the un , the chairman of the fcc , nine senators , i do n't know how many congressmen , and at least twelve of the fortune '500 ' .
he said he would be there with bells on .
what about the mayor ?
remember everybody , tonight , dinner in the city at daddy 's . you too , drew . we 've still got some loose ends --
okay . all aboard - new york , new york !
honey , please .
both .
red or white ?
okay , give me a bottle of wine .
i 'm afraid this is a wine bar , mr. quince .
9:30 's almost 10:30. where i come from , the sun 's over the yardarm , m'boy , and the cocktail lamp is lit .
well sir , it 's 9:30 in the morning .
what do you do that for ?
pinot grigio . we 're considering it for the appetizer .
and that ?
-- the late harvest riesling , mr. quince , a possibility for dessert .
... this shit 's not bad .
oh , mr. parrish , i could never buy parrish communications . i could pay for it , of course , but it would always have your imprint .
i thought you were buying my company .
left field somewhere . well , bill , i want to come in from the outfield , bat cleanup like you have , learn the plush ropes --
i 'm sorry , i do n't recall --
we 've met before , y'know , that white house function , the president had you on his right and you know where i was ?
good , good . glad to hear it .
bill , thanks for coming over ... and how 're you doing today , drew ? you 've got a firecracker here , the kid 's really set the table .
right away .
toast ? no ... just the butter .
how would you like that , sir ? on some kind of toast ?
i would prefer some peanut butter .
i would say , sir , it is right up there with jif and skippy . but miles ahead of peter pan . like a taste ?
'laura scudder 's peanut butter ' . you like it ?
you mean this , sir ?
what are you eating .
yes sir , mr. black , a pleasure .
hello . i 'm joe black . nice to meet you .
yes , sir ?
so i guess a blowjob 's out of the question ?
that 's it . it 's over . get out .
oh , you 're the great joe 's attorney now ? are we going to go to court ? or are we going to go to bed ? and i do n't mean you and me . i mean you and him .
yeah . goodnight .
well ... goodnight .
no , not okay . i thought we had a good thing going here . it shows you never know .
sorry , but i like the way he looks and talks to me . and vice versa . okay ?
that may be . but i do n't like the fucker . i do n't like the way he looks at you and talks to you . and vice versa .
drew , you 're out of line .
daddy 'll do fine . besides , he 's got joe . and so do you .
you do n't mean that . you would n't disappoint daddy --
include me out . i 've had enough of the conversations .
... see you tomorrow night .
what 'business ' ?
-- did i hear 'business ' ?
hi .
hello , beautiful .
he 'll wait --
bontecou wants a speedier response than that .
we 're not getting anywhere here . why do n't we take some of the best out of this thing , let 's consider it coolly , let 's take a week --
hello , quince .
thank you for coming .
am i not obligated to ?
you 're taking this too far , drew .
bill 's birthday is the day after tomorrow . there is a provisory by- law in our charter . per the discre- tion of the board , corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five .
and what would that be ?
the dagger -- ?
i appreciate your gentlemanliness , bill , but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
i 'm not stepping anywhere --
-- and now you 're going to pee some more .
so tell me , tell me , i 'm peeing in my pants .
not good , not bad , you know what we got ? nothing . no credit , no cars , no mortgages -- no wives . nothing .
no , i do n't --
i 'll make a note of it . anything else ?
perhaps you could remind me .
susan 's patient is whom we are talking about .
is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it ?
but i know she 's grateful for the care you 're giving her .
who are we talking about ?
well , i 'm going to tell you anyway . i did cheat on that exam at groton . but so did twenty-six other guys , and nobody ever mentioned it until today . and i 'm expecting you wo n't mention it again . i do n't know who you are and where you 're getting your information , but i 'm willing to pretend i did not hear it , and let bygones be bygones . but can i tell you something else , it 'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him . what are you , his shadow ? do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak ? you know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with w.p . that means without you . okay , pal ? let 's eat .
no .
yes .
may i interrupting ?
then why did you bring it up ?
it does n't matter .
of whom ?
it 's just a saying , mr. black ,
what an odd pairing .
yes .
`` death and taxes '' ?
yes .
and a glass .
cold .
hot or cold .
why yes , thank you .
anything else , mr. black ? how about some water ?
do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies ?
the board of parrish communications - is hereby called to order . our sole order of business is an acceptance of john bontecou 's generous offer and --
thank you .
nice to see you . i did n't expect you , but certainly you ca n't get enough of a good thing .
'here ' ?
here ...
incidentally , joe , where 're you staying ?
joe sounds like a ringer , bill . i have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already . need any help with the details ?
i did n't say .
what side of the industry did you say you were on ?
we have an arrangement now .
proof ? we 've got plenty of proof .
you 're talking through your hat . you 're offering a deal because you 've got no proof .
you get not to go to jail .
and what do i get ?
no lawyers , drew . we 're going to offer you a deal .
i think i 'd like to talk to my lawyer --
is this mr. black 's fantasy ? another one of his whoppers ? are n't you sick of this asshole lurking around ? no one knows who he is , but one thing everyone does know , he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since .
the board did n't know you 're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all .
i do n't know where you get that idea -- the board agreed --
mandatory retirement upon our chairman 's sixty-fifth birthday .
in english , please .
but who is he ? what are his creden- tials ? what is his relationship to you ?
i 've already introduced mr. black to you all .
are you running this board or am i ?
certainly , bill .
yes , you are to understand that , and now may i ask you a question ?
so i am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of bontecou 's offer ?
i 'm not interested in the details . and i 'm not interested in the big picture either . what i am inter- ersted in is how my board got conven- ed behind my back , is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with , moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish , and i am expected to clap for it like a performing seal . no , thank you .
do n't you want to hear the details ?
the answer is no , quick enough for you ?
bontecou wants a quick response and --
that 's it ?
i do n't think so . do you ?
did you want to have a cup of coffee or something , bill ?
certainly . goodnight .
i think it 's time you went home , drew .
i 'm just giving you the truth . there was a time when william parrish liked the truth .
i 'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me .
yours .
whose ?
with all due respect , you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again , there 'll be blood on the floor .
i do n't care .
what do you think the board is going to say when i tell them that ?
over my dead body .
if i read this board right now , they want you to accept bontecou 's offer .
what are their feelings ?
yes , you made your feeling abun- dantly clear . now they want to do the same with theirs .
what is there to say ? they know what john bontecou is -- and if they did n't , they know now .
sure .
okay , we 'll see you tomorrow .
i have to go , bill -- it 's been a helluva day . need a few minutes to sort everything out .
please , drew .
mind if i throw up ?
please . do n't worry about him . and above all , do n't antagonize him .
for how long ? and why ?
you 're competitive soul , drew . that 's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money . joe is just ... around .
as much as joe 's ?
i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon , drew . forgive me . i want you to know i value your advice .
well now it 's undone , okay ? forget bontecou ! scrub him ! i 'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer . i 'm not going for it .
i thought this was practically a done deal --
joe , cut it out . and you too , drew .
i was hired , you told me , to help bring parrish communications into the 21st century . this merger is the vehicle --
why ?
how nice for you both .
joe and i have no secrets from each other .
before i do -- i was hoping we might be alone , bill .
sit down , drew .
'just kidding ' ?
no .
but the matter 's still on the table , bill --
shall we adjourn ?
glad i could be of some help .
i am now .
you 're not familiar with the phrase , `` in this world , nothing is certain but death and taxes '' ?
that 's your privilege , bill . but given our needs , given the absolute necessity for growth , given the fu- ture , the truth is ... joining john bontecou is every bit as certain as - death and taxes .
sorry . i know it looks like i 'm reversing my field .
... sounds like you 're not leaving much room for discussion .
i get the feeling you 've done some business before .
no --
uh -- he 's from out of town --
have we met ?
like 'smith ' or 'jones -- '
what do you mean ?
is there any more to it ?
yes .
'joe ... '
what ? !
sorry ... um - you - you know it 's gone right out of my head --
oh , excuse me . this is -- uh -- this is --
yeah , something he goes by --
olympic .
as close as a deal could be .
so ... board convenes tomorrow , you 'll recommend , we close and it 's a deal , right ?
you have a way with words .
like a marriage made in heaven ?
i thought it was great , i thought you and big john would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- instead it was --
me , too .
i 'm all excited --
that 's great ! wait 'til i show it to bontecou .
our first annual report , must be thirty-five years ago now , i owned two stations , i wrote down a state- ment of purpose , that one day you would wake up to a parrish radio station , read a parrish paper at breakfast , catch our news on tele- vision during the day , and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain , have a good time .
bill , after this deal , you 'll be able to afford one .
do you think i need a haircut ?
it 's going to be great --
sounds good .
... tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity , you and big john , it 'll lead network news . okay so far ?
no no , not you .
why yes , bill , i was saying to quince --
did you just hear something ?
i was saying to quince we wo n't need --
maybe , who knows ? you know how voices are . let 's go .
'yes ' to the deal ?
'yes ' .
what 'd it say ?
in my sleep .
a voice ?
'thoughts ' ? not a one -- but i did hear a voice last night .
well , it 's a big day . wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff . any thoughts ? last minute refine- ments or variations ?
good morning , drew . thanks for coming out .
yeah , the short , gray hairs .
well , you 've got him by the short- hairs .
he said that ?
he had no choice . you 're a formidable adversary .
this is damn big of bill , i also think it 's smart .
go right ahead . tell william parrish how you betrayed him at a secret board meeting . and tell allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company .
i do n't want to get rich this way -- i 'm going to expose you .
the train 's left the station , pal , and you 're aboard . would you like to hear the silver lining ? check that , gold . i 've been working with john bontecou all along . we had a game plan -- acquire parrish communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder . i set it up for him , he smacks it out of the park .
but i did n't mean to do it !
quince , you ca n't unscramble scrambled eggs .
i 'm going to put a stop to this !
that we did . thanks to you . he was wobbling , mind you , but you spplied the coup de grace .
what have you done ? you 've gotten the old man fired !
that 's what he said .
'it 's up to joe ' ?
the timing -- yes . he says it 's up to joe .
-- but he was concerned about the timing ?
he was interested .
how did bill react to the leads you 've developed ?
well , i 'm happy to tell you i 've got good news . as i was telling drew , i 've been making a little hay while the bontecou sun was shining -- two , possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger .
you 're on , quin-cee . destination hospital . joe , you 'll be the tour guide . okay ? how 's that sound to you ?
i 'd like to come , too . see susan strut her stuff .
yeah . neat .
i thought so , too . joe 's a neat guy .
well , that 's very interesting .
yeah , that 's what he said .
'it 's up to joe ' , huh ?
yeah .
'it 's up to joe ' ? those were his words ?
we 'll do it together . i 'll clue you in . timing 's got to be right . the old man says it 's up to joe .
are you ?
never mind bontecou . i 've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve , and i 'm putting them to see old man .
thanks , quince .
... i know you 're down , but you know when you 're down , drew , there 's no place to go but up .
joe , you do get around .
well , i guess he 's found one .
i do n't think they 're ordinary . i love keychains .
you 're overthinking it --
i know . gum up the works .
quince , m'man , thanks for the offer , but it 's all set for just me and bill . more people might --
hey , this is it , the hour approach- es , i 'm getting all excited . so what do you think , is it -- -- just the 'executive committee ' or could you guys use me ?
can do no right by people . come to take , you wan ' to stay , leave you stay , you wan ' to go . rahtid !
only flowers i wan ' see 's one 's over my peaceful self restin ' in the dutty .

the board is waiting .
good morning , jennifer .
good morning , mr. parrish .
of course , mr. parrish . right away .
jennifer .
did n't the family get together last night -- ?
-- and call my family , i 'd like them to come over for dinner tonight .
nothing ?
no . nothing .
lunch is 'in ' today , have you given it any thought -- _
sure .
i 've been buzzing you , mr. parrish . are you all right ?
hi , jennifer .
good morning , mr. parrish .
no .
do you think i should wait to tell him 'till after the party ?
because that 's the kind of man bill parrish is .
you think so ? how do you know ?
what would you say if you knew it was me who brought down bill parrish ? i told drew and the board that bill depended on you . drew led me on , but i had no business telling him in the first place . he was setting up bill from day one . drew and bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts . bontecou was outside , drew was mr. inside . and i was the fool who made it all happen . oh god , what do i do ?
oh yes , you are one of my favorites .
free to love each other . com- pletely . totally . no fear .
what do you mean 'free ' ?
yeah , it 's like you know every inch of each other 's souls -- and then you 're free .
'the deepest , darkest secrets -- ' ?
because there 's nothing we do n't know about each other and it 's okay . i mean the deeper , darkest secrets -- they do n't matter .
but she loves you ?
i was a world-class loser and she was a happy , little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in .
how did you meet ?
oh yes , i do .
you love allison , do n't you ?
'love ' ? oh , man , i 've got troubles of my own .
love .
confused , huh ? about what ?
do i ? i 'm a little confused .
c'mon , have a drink . you look like you need one bad as me .
you 're welcome .
thanks .
and you 're a nice man , quince .
you 're an original , joe . a little hard to figure , maybe ...
on the other hand , winston churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one .
i did n't know that .
cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult western males .
no problem . i 'll leave you two alone . i can tell you guys have something on the fire --
that 's very gracious of you , quince .
it 's so very nice to see you again .
do n't bother asking , we already tried .
hey , this is fun .
black .
as long as it takes .
how long you here , joe ?
are you ?
you bet . i 'm king of my rotisserie league .
yes ?
'joe black ' . won fifteen and lost two for the brooklyn dodgers in 1952 .
yeah ... and you 're the prettier thing here .
you think so ?
well , i do n't know what else to say . it 's a helluva party --
that 's it ?
thank you for loving me .
-- yes ?
susan --
hold me --
i love you now , i 'll love you always --
tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
but you 're not . you 're somewhere else . you 're someone else --
i 'm still here .
you want me to wait for you , you 'll be back --
i - uh --
-- that was the place ... and you were the guy .
the 'coffee shop ' --
and i said you 'd have a hard time finding a woman like that .
did i say that ?
yes , that 's why i said it .
i believe that , do n't you ?
it 's a saying .
'love will find out the way ' ?
'love will find out the way ' .
what will we do ?
lightning struck . we caught it in a bottle . do n't let it out . i want to be with you , joe --
will it ?
do n't . that will come later .
but there 's so much to tell you --
we know all that we need to know --
we know so little about each other --
then do n't .
no worse than it gets for me . i 'm in love with a woman whom i do n't want to leave .
it gets worse .
i can tell you the when part . tonight .
and you ca n't tell me who you are .
well -- i --
where are you going ?
yes . your father and i , our time together has come to an end .
it beats a surgical , does n't it ?
i love you in an evening gown .
i like you in a black tie .
oh , i hope a long , long time .
for how long ?
nowhere ? i 'm ... here .
where are you going ?
yes !
more than you love peanut butter ?
i loved it .
did you like making love to me ?
maybe it 's the draft through the door .
... no .
yes , he 's tired . i believe so .
he must be tired -- this bontecou thing --
he 's taking a nap .
how beautiful .
i just thought i 'd drop by , scrounge a little lunch , i was in the neigh- borhood --
i am .
you 're here ?
faster . and i want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever .
and is your heart beating strangely ?
well ... i 'm -- uh , joe . and you 're susan . and i - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
i do n't know who you are .
yes ?
why , yes . thank you .
never tried , 'til now . joe , may i kiss you ?
-- could you ?
it was everything .
thank you .
-- i guess you have n't .
i love your smell .
please . we do n't need to talk about drew .
i 'm sorry about --
i said get out .
almost .
why do n't you get off his case ?
you first .
yes . i 'm tired .
'to bed ' ?
to bed .
where are you going ?
no .
gay ?
no .
girlfriend ?
no , i 'm not .
because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married .
why ?
i do n't like the way drew spoken to you . but i feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back .
how long have you been standing there ?
i 'm sorry to hear that .
we 're doing what we can for her . but it does n't look good .
has her pain abated ?
i am , too .
i 'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today .
yes ... i 've found that it does .
it comforts you , does n't it ?
yes ...
i adore things like that ... .food i ca n't do without . do n't you ?
i do n't know .
why do you love peanut butter so much ?
and i appreciate you , too .
i mean i appreciate that .
excuse me ?
i appreciate you --
it was n't an intrusion . and if it was , it turned out to be welcome .
well , now i am sorry . for intruding on you this afternoon .
i thought you said 'be sorry for nothing ' .
i wanted to apologize , susan --
be sorry for nothing .
i have to go , i 'm sorry to say --
not now .
joe , i 'm with drew .
yes .
she 's in a great deal of pain .
i do n't mind --
patients have visitors , not doctors .
and i 'll be a visitor .
that 's impossible . i 'm a doctor , i 'm --
whatever you do .
watch me do what ?
very well , i 'll watch .
i do n't have any time to see you now . i 'm doing grand rounds and then i 'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
i came to see you .
then why are you here , joe ?
oh goodness , no .
how nice you look . is that your uniform ?
joe --
i think you want to go to the west wing . through there .
yes ?
goodnight to you , susan .
goodnight , joe .
did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder ?
yes ?
susan ?
i 'm sorry to say i know what you 're saying .
i have a certain function to per- form , and that seems to take all of my time . bu sometimes - uh - i speculate - uh - i have n't left room for - uh - anything else .
yes -- ?
i can see why .
i do n't have any .
i 've got plenty of friends .
i guess what i 'm trying to say is -- i 'd like us to be friends .
no , joe , i 'm swimming here . then i 'm going home .
i 'm sorry . do you live here ?
drew is none of your damn business . nor is where i put my mouth .
when you put your mouth to his , susan , it seems a frequent thing .
come again ?
do you love drew ?
-- what kind of childhood did you have ?
i have n't .
you act like you never had peanut butter before --
peanut butter .
what are your intentions ? to make little dreams in coffee shops , turn a woman 's head , and i do n't mind admitting it was turned , i liked it , but ten hours later i feel like a fool . i do n't get it . you , my father , here in this house , the cof- fee shop , it 's making me upset , and i do n't like being upset . who are you anyway ? and what are you eating ?
that is not my intention .
not the one i met this morning , hit- ting on me in as nice a way as i 've been hit on in a long time , but the moment you find out i 'm my dad 's daughter , you act like a stranger .
i am joe .
you appear at his side out-of-the- blue , stay at his house , eat dinner with his family , it 's practically a first . you 're in the red-hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe .
'big ' ?
i 'm sorry .
-- ca n't seem to escape you today .
i 'm lost .
what are you doing here ?
that 's life . what can i tell you ?
yes .
yes .
i guess you have your reasons .
not exactly .
thank you .
happy birthday , bill .
an indictable offense .
an offense --
undisclosed conflict of interest --
moreover , agent joe black here -- of course that 's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement , drew . he developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence . unfortunately , that 's known as a conflict of interest --
and we 're very grateful .
the treasury department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of john bontecou . they were convinced that bontecou , on past deals , had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for . the irs wanted to go after him , and this deal offered them the opportunity . i agreed to cooperate .
-- an irs man .
i 'll take it from here -- i am --
he is --
prepare yourself , drew - i am --
i told you to shut up .
it 's not necessary , joe . drew 's going to step aside --
it 's time to put this person where he belongs .
joe , do n't do this --
get him in here .
okay .
i certainly hope so -- i loved susan from the moment she was born , and i love her now , and every minute in between , and what i dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her , who is worthy of her , who is of this world , of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life .
are you threatening me ?
i do n't expect you to .
i do n't like what you 're saying .
does she know where she 's going ?
no .
with you ? ! who is 'you ' ? did you tell her who you are ?
susan wants to come . she says she 's in love with me .
well , they 're mine now .
those were my words , bill .
multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about .
so that 's what love is ?
trust , responsibility , taking the weight , for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them . and above all , not hurting the object of your love .
which is what ?
some aimless infatuation in which , for the moment , you feel like in- dulging . it 's missing everything that matters .
then what is it ?
how perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you . it 's not love --
i love her , bill . she is all that i ever wanted , and i 've never wanted for anything because i 've never wanted anything before , if you can understand .
susan is my daughter , she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you 're going to deprive her of it and you 're telling me you 're sorry ? well , i 'm sorry , apology not accepted .
i 'm sorry , bill --
you 're not taking susan anywhere . and what the hell does that mean anyway ?
i think you heard me , bill .
you 're what ?
i 'm in love with your daughter , and i 'm taking her with me tonight .
say again ?
-- and i 'm in love with your daughter .
you 'want to know ' , i 'll tell you . you 're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the valley of the shadow of death , he 's galloping into it . and the same time , the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates . and , oh yes , i almost forgot , my daughter 's fallen in love with death .
i was just asking , bill .
what the hell do you care ?
not at all .
thanks .
good . tomorrow , after the party .
yeah .
you are ?
what are you saying , that it 's time to go ?
-- i have the feeling that , all in all , what i made this voyage for -- has served its purpose .
yes ?
uh --
i told you , 'watch it ' .
cut the 'bill ' crap out -- you sonofabitch .
may i remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor , this is me . so watch it ... bill .
and i do n't give a shit .
i do n't like your tone , and i do n't like your references .
any universe that exists or ever existed . you may be the pro , joe . but i know who you are . and you 're all fucked up .
this universe ?
you 're violating the laws of the universe .
i picked you for your verve , your excellence , and for your ability to - how shall i say - instruct . you 've lived a first-rate life . and i find it eminently usable .
yes , and stop repeating everything i say , and turning it into a question . spooning , fooling around , god knows what . you arrive on the scene -- why you picked me , i still do n't under- stand --
'spooning ' ?
well , you goddam well should . you walk into my life , give me the worst news a guy can get , have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family , and now you 're spooning with my daughter .
with all due respect , bill , i 'm not asking your permission .
i 'm her father !
i 'll be the judge of that .
well , you 're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman .
yes , i saw you see me .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
i could n't sleep .
then i ca n't help you .
i 'm not hungry .
never mind . i 'm tired . i 'm going to take a nap .
'fish ' ?
what 'okay ' is , it 's 'okay ' it 's over . we 've got bigger fish to fry , do n't we , joe ?
just a manner of speaking .
what 's okay ?
that 's okay .
i 'm sorry , bill --
goodnight .
okay . goodnight .
um -- not right now .
hello . would you like to join me , quince and allison for a nightcap ?
hello , bill .
are you going to fire me , bill ?
how about you telling me ? when i ask a simple question , i expect a straight answer . that 's what i 'm used to . anybody who does n't give it to me , i fire .
you tell me , bill .
what way would you put it ?
i would n't put it that way .
about susan ?
i guess ...
you were just curious ?
i do n't know .
why did you go to the hospital ?
easy , bill . you 'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation .
and i do n't need your goddamn permis- sion either ! you ! drew ! i do n't need anyone to tell me how to run my life .
okay .
i do n't want anybody buying up my life 's work and turning it into something it was n't meant to be . a man wants to leave something behind . and he wants it left behind the way he made it . and he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor , of dedication , of truth . okay ?
why , at this juncture , are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters ?
absolutely .
dinner ? absolutely .
this part i 'm interested in .
i thought you 'd heard a trillion times --
well ... i do n't know .
why did n't you stop me ?
and more .
cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef , not as boring as chicken . she knew stuff like that .
uh-huh .
glad you like it . my wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches . joan -- that was my wife --
truly - uh - splendid .
cold lamb sandwich with cilantro . a little coleman 's mustard .
excellent . what is it ?
it 's all yours .
are you going to eat your lunch
no thank you , bill . i can manage .
jennifer , give mr. black a map of the city .
oh . okay .
now i 'd like to be alone .
of course .
joe , could i ask you to take a walk ? buy a tie or something . i know i 'll be seeing you .
you 're not thinking of going some- where , are you , bill ?
yes , i am . there 's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor . why do n't you go down and read some magazines ?
are you sad , bill ?
... i 'd like to be alone for a while .
i do n't understand .
-- what 's the deal here ? are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end ?
yes .
would you like to sit down , joe ?
i 'm sure you 'll see to it that it wo n't be a problem .
what i 'm trying to say is this is a board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the board .
no .
perhaps you would like to wait in my office -- ?
so can i .
yes .
can you keep a secret ?
what 's it like where i 'm going ?
what do you mean ?
what 's it like ?
i understand .
i want to live .
that 's what everybody says .
i 'm not everybody .
that 's what everybody says .
-- i do n't deserve this . i 'm still young , this is not my time --
not this .
there 's one to every rule .
make an exception ?
how about giving a guy a break ?
yes , bill .
joe -- ?
so you 've grasped the idea . con- gratulations . now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever , and you still will have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about .
of course .
so you understand the concept then . when you 're busy here , your work , what your task is , is being executed elsewhere .
i guess so .
you were hatching ideas , making plans , arriving at decisions , right ?
what do you mean ?
when you were shaving this morning , you were n't just shaving , right ?
you 've got a deal .
yes ?
bill --
you give your word , i give mine -- that we 'll do what we say . it 's a truth exchanged between two people .
a 'deal ' ?
it is a deal ?
sounds fair enough .
and i wo n't tell anyone who you are .
and what ?
oh , i would n't tell them anything , bill . you 'll ruin the good start we had last night . i felt as if i were being treated like a person . 'joe ' this and 'joe ' that - a nice smile - quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture ' or 'passion ' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting , but i am cer- tain , should you - uh - say - uh - who i am - our adventure would end abruptly .
um -- well , i did n't sleep too well . this is crazy . this is the left- field thing of all time . what do i do ? what do i tell my family ?
'feeling ' ? i feel fine . how do you feel ?
how are you ? how 're you feeling ?
good morning , bill .
good morning .
good night to you , bill .
and - uh - i guess , 'goodnight ' .
not at all .
well , thank you for letting me know .
closer than that .
i hope you realize , bill ... in your office this morning , that was your time .
no --
your doctor ? did your doctor say anything about a tiny , undetectable hole in your aorta ? did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain ? were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in gstaad ?
... i just saw my doctor , he told me everything was fine .
that 's the best i can do . ... but minute-by-minute , i find myself lingering .
when you go , i go .
you 're putting me on the spot , bill .
how long have i got ?
i wo n't .
if there is anything else , do n't hesitate --
no .
thank you . would you like the man 's name ?
what a good idea .
it had n't occurred to me until then . i was just having such a wonderful time -- besides , is n't this what i 'm here for ?
i wish you had said something to me about staying here --
no .
so there 's nothing between you and susan ?
i did n't know her . the body i took knew her . the man she met in the coffee shop this morning . i - uh - took him .
shook me up . i mean that you knew her and everything --
'threw ' you ? where ?
... i 'm sorry , i 'm a little discon- certed , that stuff between you and susan -- uh -- threw me .
thank you .
joe , that 's the kitchen .
joe knows what you 're saying , just being polite --
no --
then do n't .
when i introduce you , if i say who you are , i do n't think anyone will stay for dinner .
speak up , please .
it just occurred to me --
of course .
excuse me ? could i say something ?
bill , i am eating dinner with you . and your family . and that 's what we 're doing . it 's not open for discussion . nothing is . do n't you understand ?
this is crazy -- you 're not going to eat dinner with us .
and then -- ?
you should hope quite a while .
i do ? how long will you be staying ?
you fill the bill , bill .
you want me to be your guide -- ?
the jacket and the pair of pants came with the body i took . let me ask your opinion . do i blend in ?
you 're not death . you 're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants .
that 's me .
death !
yes .
' ... yes -- '
you are -- ?
you 're coming to 'take me ' . what is that ? who the hell are you ?
i am not a dream .
am i dreaming this ? are you a dream ?
yes , bill . the question .
the 'question ' --
bill . come on . the question . the question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran for the plane in delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning . the question that is in the back of your throat , choking the blood to your brain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
what question ?
'yes ' is the answer to your ques- tion .
yes what ?
in return you 'll receive minuets , days , weeks , i 'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that i stay interested .
i 'm sorry --
watch it !
what the hell are you talking about ?
time .
get what ?
show me around . be my guide . and in return , you get ...
'the one ' to do what ?
it requires competence , wisdom , experience -- all those things they say about you in testimonials -- and you 're the one .
'take me ' ... ? where ?
i want to have a look around before i take you .
about what ?
just think of millenniums multiplied by aeons compounded by infinity , i 've been around that long , but it 's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest . call it boredom , the natural curiosity of me , the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you .
what the hell is this ? who are you ?
the great bill parrish at a loss for words ? the man from whose lips fall 'rapture ' and 'passion ' and 'obses- sion ' ... all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy ' , what there is no sense 'living your life without ... ' , all the sparks and energy you give off , the rosy advice you dispense in round , pear-shaped tones --
quiet .
what is this , a joke , right ? some kind of elaborate practical joke ? at my 40th reunion , we delivered a casket to the class president 's hotel room and --
i 'm here .
where are you ?
know what ? know what , goddammit !
i think you know --
what do you mean ? !
there 's going to be plenty of time for that .
please . talk to me --
it 's enough now .
where are you ? are you there ?
no , you 're not . you 're trying to 'handle ' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle .
i 'm sorry , i --
are you giving me orders ?
what you were talking about .
what are you talking about ?
try . because 'if you have n't tried , you have n't lived ' .
i do n't !
i think you know --
i believe you did .
i did n't ask any question .
'yes ' is the answer to your question .
'yes ' what ?
what ?
' ... i know , it 's none of my business . '
sir , i 'll deliver the package .
quince , i 've got confidence in you .
you think drew will go for it ?
all in all , what bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to drew with no hard feelings .
yes , i believe i do .
joe knew the whole story . i told him . it was his idea that i come clean . i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls , you know what i mean ?
sure .
come in , joe -- i want to thank you -- okay , bill ?
it 's okay , quince . i understand . you 've always meant well and i appreciate that . sometimes things just turn out -- wrong .
... what can i say after i say that i 'm sorry ? i zipped when i should 've zagged , i opened my big mouth one too many times , everything got all twisted --
the vodka . what 'd i tell you ?
this one .
see . there . what 'd i tell you ?
yeah , i give a shit .
but he does give a shit . do n't you , bill ?
no thank you , quince . i 'm sorry , honey . i 'm no good at this . why do n't you choose whatever cake you like ?
this is great , honey . the orange . has it got a little vodka in it ? like that finnish stuff , orange vodka -- put your lips around this one , bill . it 's out of this world .
joe , you do n't know how glad i am you 're aboard . anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , i 'm in his corner .
no , anything is possible . it 's up to joe .
yeah . or the week after .
next week ?
but i 've got to tell you , if mergers are in the wild , i 've got some great prospects i 've developed . i want to talk to you about them next week .
thank you , quince .
... i read you all the way on the bontecou thing , and i know where you 're coming from . and i 'm with you a hundred and one percent .
bontecou day . going to close with big john -- look at you , bill , all cool as a cat and over at bontecou 's , i 'll bet he 's shitting in his pants .
how 's that , quince ?
i am , this is it . b day .
i 'm doing great . you ready ?
how 're you doing -- ?
good morning , quince .
hi , bill --
but we want you back , bill . mean- while , enjoy your party , celebrate , we 'll attend to the nasty details . and mr. black , may we say thank you .
well , thank you , that 's great , but it 's more than i bargained for . i just wanted to set the record straight .
we 're all ears .
i appreciate this , eddie , members of the board , this will just take a minute of your time . as the custo- dians of the company , you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not . either way , thanks .
we 're all here , bill --
okay , eddie -- anyway , thanks for the memory .
sorry , bill , have a drink , eat your cake , blow out the candles and make a wish . talk to you monday . okay ?
if you 're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty , forget it .
no , i 'm going to stay down here , keep my finger in the dike and maybe by monday , the waters could recede .
eddie , hold out all the hope you want but , i promise you , it 's hope- less , it 's over . come on up , let 's get drunk , if i had your shoulder to lean on i might actually enjoy this --
the board 's working through the weekend , tying up the loose ends on this damn thing . but i want to give it one more try , i 'm still holding out some hope .
fine , fine . big doing up here . why are you still down here ?
yeah - bill - how are you ? you okay ?
eddie ?
i 'm going to stick it out here . we still have a shot .
yes , the big 'celebration ' of my mandatory retirement birthday . you 're an honored guest , eddie .
i still sense some doubt in this group , we could turn it around . you 'll be up in the country ?
please , eddie , no 'fat lady sings '' shit .
... it 's not over , 'til it 's over .
well said , eddie . mr. black , shall we ?
why do n't we let it rest for the moment ? give it some air ?
the fireworks are about to start .
what was that ?
oh , dad , you 're not old . you 'll never be old .
if you do n't mind dancing with an old fogey like me .
oh , yes --
i 'm still here . would you like to dance with me , susan ?
that 's why it 's okay .
i love you , daddy --
no -- i love you so much and i want you to promise me something . i do n't want you to ever worry about me . if anything should happen , i 'm going to be fine and everything 's going to be all right . -- and i have no regrets .
daddy --
i want you to know how much i love you . that you 've given a meaning to my life that i had no right to expect , and that no one can ever take from me .
but what ?
yes , but --
are you relieved ?
i 'm sorry .
you were right about joe , he is going somewhere --
i 'm having a helluva time .
what a night .
i do n't care if you love him ! i 'm telling you he 's no good for you !
i love him .
in this case , i ca n't . i - uh -- i just ca n't help you . i only would tell you -- that with joe , you are on very , very dangerous ground .
c'mon ! the guy 's working with you . you always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
i do n't know , i ca n't say --
where 's he going ?
susan , i do n't think joe is going to be with us long .
what are you afraid of , dad ? that i 'll fall head over heels for joe -- well , i have -- as you did with mom . that 's always been standard , whether you like or not .
you do n't know anything about joe --
why ? a man appears at your side , almost never leaves it , you clearly trust him , depend on him , i sense you value him deeply , why are n't those things good enough for me ?
this is crazy --
love . passion . obsession , all those things you told me to wait for . well , they 've arrived .
i do n't understand .
because i was sitting in a staff meeting , incredibly bored , my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- joe .
i do n't know .
where is he ?
joe ?
where 's joe ?
it 's something .
then what is it ?
when you say 'nothing ' that way , it 's not nothing .
nothing .
now we love drew and joe in verbo- ten ? what 's going on ?
i do n't think this is the lightning you are looking for . drew 's a good man . i know i did n't seem to be completely in his corner before , but i 've come to appreciate --
then what will you say ?
i wo n't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
well , remember how you told me about `` lightning striking '' ? the nature of it 's in there somewhere .
what is the nature of your interest in joe ?
raise away .
do you mind if i raise a little caution flag ?
yeah , it 's good to get together .
that was wonderful .
will it ? ...
it 'll come back , daddy .
cut it out , susan . you and i 've got to talk . big day tomorrow , everybody . joe , let 's go .
funny , i do n't get that feeling . maybe it 's because you found out i 'm bill parrish 's daughter .
incidentally , 'joe ' what ?
uh - will that hold you , joe ?
-- this morning . the corinth coffee shop . he was looking for a doctor .
what ? !
we 've met .
you know each other ?
yer damn right .
well , go get 'em , pops .
a-okay . got my gloves on , my ears pricked . i 'm ready for action .
are you okay ?
nothing .
what is it , daddy -- ?
nothing . i 'm sorry .
daddy , what 's the matter ?
he does n't care . but thanks anyway .
thank god .
i know . but i 'm the only father you 've got .
you 're terrible .
you wo n't tell him , and even if you did , he 'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton .
i wo n't . and when i tell drew about it , he wo n't either .
stay open . who knows ? lightning could strike .
i 'm sorry . but give it to me again . the short version .
aw , you 're tough .
bravo .
i know it 's a cornball thing but love is passion , obsession , someone you ca n't live without . if you do n't start with that , what are you going to end up with ? i say fall head over heels . find someone you can love like crazy and who 'll love you the same way back . and how do you find him ? forget your head and listen to your heart . i 'm not hearing any heart . run the risk , if you get hurt , you 'll come back . because , the truth is there is no sense living your life without this . to make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well , you have n't lived a life at all . you have to try . because if you have n't tried , you have n't lived .
'be deliriously happy ' . i 'm going to do my upmost --
be deliriously happy . or at least leave yourself open to be .
that 's all ?
well , it worries me . i want you to get swept away . i want you to levitate . i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish .
do n't get dirty , dad --
oh yes , i am . not an ounce of excitement , not a whisper of a thrill , this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
you 're not listening --
that 's for me . i 'm talking about you . it 's not so much what you say about drew , it 's what you do n't say .
so what 's wrong with that ?
listen , i 'm crazy about the guy -- he 's smart , he 's aggressive , he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it .
what were you going to say ?
well , i was n't going to say that --
and i 'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me .
susan , you 're a hell of a woman . you 've got a great career , you 're beautiful --
uh oh --
do n't get carried away .
probably .
forget about me and mom -- are you going to marry him ?
you mean like you loved mom ?
do you love drew ?
i know it 's none of my business --
... there 's a start for a meeting .
i am . with you .
i thought you were in a meeting -- ?
thank god . now could we go ? let 's get this day started .
you 're only six-five once .
not my birthday again ?
... then do n't .
i do n't like to interfere .
yeah . i guess so .
you like him , do n't you ?
i hope so .
does drew tell you everything ?
drew told me .
how did you know ?
will you relax ? i know it is a big deal day --
he wanted to ride back down with you . now sit and relax , get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
drew 's aboard ?
hi , honey .
good morning , dad .
but we 've got time .
... we know so little about each other .
y'did n't ?
no --
you said you liked me .
because i like you so much . now i 've got to go .
why not ?
sure , i 'll give you the name of a doctor . ... and i do n't want to examine you .
because i like you so much . you have coffee here every morning , do n't you ? if i came by , could you give me the name of a doctor ?
why ?
i 've been thinking ... i do n't want you to be my doctor . because i do n't want you to examine me .
no , it was so right it scares me .
did i say something wrong ?
i 've got to go --
you never know . lightning could strike .
you 'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
i would .
you 'd give up what you want for the woman you marry ?
i know what you 're saying . does n't pay very well . depends on the woman i marry . maybe she 'd like a bigger house , a better car , lotsa kids , college does n't come cheap --
'pro bono ' . that means doing good -- going to be doing good all your life ?
... it 's kind of a pro bono job .
and i want to get into my apartment and go to work . please , what do you say , another cup of coffee ?
i 've got patients coming in --
how 'bout another cup of coffee ?
not at all .
-- this is my lucky day . i arrive in this big bad city and i not only find a doctor , a beautiful woman as well .
yes , i could . i have an office in the hospital .
'her ' .
i could be her .
so if i needed a doctor , you could be it ?
me ? internal medicine .
everybody 's a doctor around here . this apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers . the guy i 'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor . what kind of doctor ?
how 'd you know ?
damn right . looking for her right now . who knows ? you might be her .
so you 're a one-girl guy ?
i 'm not trying to sharpshoot you , but that 'nothing lasts ' stuff , that 's what was the trouble with honey 's guy . he was fooling around and honey caught him at it . one girlfriend was n't enough for him .
i was just being agreeable , now i 've got to explain why ?
why ?
i agree --
nothing lasts .
what 's the way ?
nothing to be sorry about . that 's the way with men and women , is n't it ?
i 'm sorry --
my kid sister . she just broke up with her boyfriend and she 's thinking about dropping out of law school .
you and 'honey ' ?
oh yeah ? what was 'fascinating ' about it ?
not at all . it was fascinating .
good morning , i was talking kind of loud there , sorry .
i 've got to get back for the evening shift , so make yourself at home , watch t.v. , whatever . just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed . i never need them all anyway .

how did they explain what you remembered ? the gun and stuff ?

he was beating the crap out of me ! i had to tell him something !
why would you do that ?
i told him about your car .

and ?
i 'll go see him .
what are you gon na do ?

he did n't believe me . he said that if i do n't get him the money tomorrow he 's gon na kill me . then he started hitting me .

did you ?
something feels wrong . i think someone 's fucking with me . trying to get me to kill the wrong guy .
yes .
so i just take your word ?
i came to you straight after he did it . i showed you what he 'd done and asked for your help .
how do i know he did that to you ?
leonard , you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me .
that 's the problem ! how can i find john g. when i do n't know what 's going on ? ! how did you get me into this ? !
calm down . you 're not into anything . it was my problem , you offered no help . it 's got nothing to do with your investigation .

mrs. jankis , what do you want from me ?
then why are you here ?
i 'm not appealing the decision .
we should n't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal .
i 'm not interested in the company position , mr. shelby . i want to know your honest opinion about sammy .
mrs. jankis , the company 's position is n't that sammy is `` faking '' anything , just that his condition ca n't be shown -
mr. shelby , you know all about sammy and you decided that he was faking -

you probably . *
just some guy . does it even matter who ? i stopped asking myself why a long time ago . no reason , no conspiracy ; just bad fucking luck . a couple of junkies , too * strung out to realize that your wife did n't live alone . when you killed him , * i 've never seen you so happy - i was convinced you 'd remember . but it did n't stick , like nothing ever sticks . like this wo n't stick .
so who are you saying he was ? *
i 'm not . i was the cop assigned to your * wife 's death . i believed you , i thought * you deserved the chance for revenge . i helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night . the guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife . * we found him and you killed him . * memento - green revisions 10-4-99 115a .

are you sure ?
my wife was n't diabetic .
sammy did n't have a wife .
i was wrong ! that 's the whole point ! sammy 's wife came to me and -
you exposed him for what he was : a fraud .
i never said he was faking ! i never said that !
sammy was a con man . a faker .
sammy let his wife kill herself ! sammy ended up in an institution - ! *
like you 've told yourself . over and over . conditioning yourself to believe . `` learning through repetition '' -
that 's sammy , not me ! i told you about sammy -
i dunno ... your wife surviving the assault ... her not believing about your condition ... the doubt tearing her up inside.. , the insulin -
what the fuck are you talking about ?
you tell everyone about sammy . everyone who 'll listen . `` remember sammy jankis , remember sammy jankis '' . great story . gets better every time you tell it . so you lie to yourself to be happy . nothing wrong with that - we all do . who cares if there 's a few little things you 'd rather not remember ?
he knew about sammy . why would i tell him about sammy ? *
that , and your thing . *
this is a drug deal ? !
well , i hope it 's not as serious as his , 'cos this guy 's dead .
i do n't know . see , i have this condition .
maybe . maybe just .
no . do n't worry , i 'm a cop . everything 'll be okay . is he still breathing ?
he might have fallen down the stairs , i do n't know , i do n't know what 's going on , i 'm confused . i have this memory thing - do i know you ?
there 's a guy in here , hurt bad ! we got ta get him to a doctor !
what 's wrong ?
would n't be appropriate . *
you 're not coming ?
i 'm a snitch . he 's a cop from out of town looking for information . the local boys put us in touch .
how do you know him ?
'cos he fucking told me . he thinks it 's funny . he 's laughing at you .
how do you know this ?
he knows you 're no good on the phone , so * he calls you up to bullshit you . * sometimes you stop taking his calls , so * he slips something under your door to * frighten you into answering your phone * again . he 's been pretending to help you . * feeding you a line of crap about john g. * being some local drug dealer . *

why not ?
why ? come on , leonard , we talked about this . it 's not safe f or you to be walking around like this .
why ?

do n't go back in there . there 's a motel out of town .

i wo n't be happy until you leave town .

why are you following me ?
she has no idea who i am .
why not ? memento blue revisions - 8/27/99
she could n't .
yeah , well maybe she 'll make it you . is that it ? you worried she 'll use me against you ?

from who ?
she 's gon na use you . to protect herself .
she 's involved with these drug dealers .
what do you mean `` bad news '' ?
because she 'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage . she 's already got you staying with her , for fuck 's sake .
why 's that ?
who 's she ?

so what are you gon na do now ?
you like it ? let 's trade .
what 's wrong with this one ?
fuck you . we shoulda taken his car .
yeah . i think it was your sinister mustache that got him .
so was he scared ?
give me your keys .
i 'll ride with him . you follow .
easy for you to say , you 've got the jag .
shut it , teddy .
we probably ought to take his car , you know , teach him a lesson .
fucking hope not .
it must be his . i do n't think they 'd let someone like me carry a gun .
i do n't know .
how 'd ya get him in here in the first place ?
we ca n't just walk him out tied up and bleeding .
he 's got to have a car , right ? we just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him .
we 've got to get him out of here .
why ?
natalie ? natalie who ?
no . no , just let me think for a minute .
i 'm not gon na help you kill this guy , if that 's what -
i might have fallen asleep before i did .
think so ? you do n't know ? did n't you write it down ?
i do n't think so .
no ! should i ?
you do n't know him ?
you called me . you wanted my help . you know , lenny , i 've had more rewarding friendships than this one . although i do get to keep using the same jokes .
why are you here ?
probably left it in your room .
discount inn . do n't know what room ; have n't got my key .
just for revenge . that 's what keeps me going . it 's all i have .
you 're living .
he took away the woman i love and he took away my memory . he destroyed everything ; my life and my ability to live .
you really want to find this guy ?
why ?
lenny , you ca n't trust a man 's life to your little notes and pictures .
yeah , well i go on facts , not recommendations , okay ?
well , the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up . get you to kill the wrong guy .
why ?
the guy you 're looking for , johnny g. that 's why you have n't left . am i right ?
who ?
yeah , yeah . i heard enough about him . tell me about john g. you still think he 's here , right ?
it 's weird , but if you do n't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . you get sort of shaky but you do n't realize you have n't eaten . have i told you about sammy jankis ?
you do n't have to remember to be hungry .
it 's my condition . i never know if i 've already eaten , so i always just eat small amounts .
only every time i see ya ! come on , i 'll buy you lunch .
guess i 've told you about my condition .
so i see . it 's good to see you . my name 's teddy .
things change .
you said you were leaving town .
unfinished business . what made you think i was n't coming back ?
i 'll be waiting . *
lenny , it 's teddy . look , stay there , okay ? i 'm gon na be right over .
john gammell ?
lenny , is that you ?
mr gammell ?
yup ?
i do n't remember .
yeah , it 's just this fucked-up building . * why are we going there ?
you know it ?
what the hell you want to go there for ?
you 're in a playful mood .
this is your car .
i guess i 've told you about my condition .
did you ? i musta forgot . i 'm teddy . *
lem me take you down in the basement and show you what you 've become .
shut your mouth !
that 's who you were , you do n't know who you are .
i 'm leonard shelby , i 'm from san francisco and i 'm -
teddy !
leonard , you do n't have a clue what 's going on . you do n't even know my name .
beg my forgiveness ! beg my wife 's forgiveness before i blow your brains out !
fuck you ; i gave you a reason to live and * you were more than happy to help . you lie * to yourself ! you do n't want the truth , * the truth is a fucking coward . so you * make up your own truth . *
* thank you . *
a load of amphetamine i told him i had .
what was it for ? *
his name 's james f. grantz , john g. check * your tattoos . *
bullshit . *
this bad cop . he checked you into the * discount inn . then he 's been calling you * for days , sticking envelopes under your * door , telling you shit . *
what cop ?
why would i have a gun ?
okay . we clean him up , untie him and * march him out with a gun in his back . *
with the united nations high commission on refugees . famine relief .
doing ... ?
no . i was in namibia ...
you in miami workin ' on your complexion ... ?
gottingen . that 's in sweden .
lemon does n't go in gin and tonics , darlin ' . where ya ' from ?
lemon or lime ?
gin and tonic . plymouth or boodles .
trudy and i are goin ' for gina ...
... eliminated one . swat 's on the next two ...
there 's three between miami international and the glades . i 'm gon na try for her , but this is triage . protect the maximum number of lives . you need to know that ...
she 's sending a message . meth lab . trailer park . anything with interesting antenna arrays ... ?
they may have already , so we protect the living . proof she 's alive ?
they 'll kill gina .
then that 's it . change the mission statement . crockett stays in . he keeps working up the ladder . the local importers get a pass for the time being .
with sonny . 110 % .
so what 's gon na persuade montoya to change off sal maguda running his deliveries ... ?
oh , yeah ...
he any good ?
sal maguda .
i got to know . there is never any room for `` personal '' ...
`` and '' what ?
and ... ?
i was the kids ' godfather .
about the stevens family , i 'm sorry . i know you were close to them .
grieve elsewhere .
we know these people ... !
turn around .
quarter mile away . we see the lights ...
what 's your twenty ?
yeah .
safe house is empty ... air support 's set to jump when we know your drop point . gina ?
just came in . she 's still alive .
you ca n't .
get me air support ... we 'll be airborne and assault the ambush ...
it 's a rip and a hit .
what do you think ?
they 'll have surveillance on us . we 'll know only at the last moment ...
where 's the new drop point ... ?
jos yero changed-up the drop plan on us . he 's grabbed gina .
yeah ?
three wakes off the back of those boats . who runs three sterling engines off a deep-v hull ?
okay . what 'd you spot ... ?
good .
he is fine . and we know the jokes . when it gets vengeful , things get messy . when they get messy the wrong people die ... everybody gets it .
recruit us to do what ?
... i did n't want you around the crime scene because it 's crawling with federal law enforcement . we do n't know who 's straight up , who 's not ...
no , you do n't , jim . 'cause if i close this down , you got nothing to make a phone call about . and my guys do n't have a week for a feeb bureaucratic process . every hour longer they 're in there , they risk exposure . so , right here , right now , they 're back in or i pull them out and close you down . what 's it going to be ?
i got to talk to my ado ...
yes you do ...
i do n't know .
of course . from my side , i do n't want to know anything about what you 're doing or how you do it ... so let me know if we 're on ...
i mean < u > full < /u > disclosure .
sure .
... you 'd be operating outside territorial united states . your badges do not count . you have no authorization to carry weapons . if you 're busted , it could take a long time to get you re-patriated . and there 's no backup ... and you will share with them all your intel on montoya ...
you need to consider a few issues .
they knew about alonzo , < u > before < /u > he made a move on them . they had our operation . they 've cut into us .
tell them what you want .
not anymore . this is a distribution network out of south florida , moving poly-drug loads , crystal meth through coke , to nashville , atlanta , memphis , cleveland . and computer fraud , identity theft . it 's like that .
we 're not certain !
you said nazi low-riders ... ?
we 're not certain ...
deal .
make it 35 .
make it 40 % .
25 % discount on the load .
my end ?
two main players plus three .
how many ?
and our friend do n't like the rest of the people bringin ' the merch to you .
i got the item .
okay . you got the `` item '' ?
all i want to know is the where and the when . spare me mini moves , progress reports and bullshit .
meth precursors and the dutch party favors are en route .
so ... ?
it still is . i 'm so in this , i do n't know which way is up ... all i know is i wo n't let anything bad happen to you . just like i said . and i know we ca n't ever see each other again . and we never will .
i know . and now ?
no part of it was n't real .
no .
what are you going to do with me ? are you taking me to jail ? you think i will turn into your informant , is that it ?
... it 's gon na be an l-shaped ambush . they 're not gon na open up until they got the party favors , 'cause all they 'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight . they < u > will < /u > wait till they got the goods before they do the deed .
if they attack you ...
maybe . maybe with the crazy whites .
yero , by himself ?
i 'll be on board by noon .
... in the morning .
would you ? because if you could n't , i would be very lonely ... i would have left the only world i know and have known since i was seventeen . but none of this will happen . so it does n't matter . because we are on the guajira peninsula . and all you see around you ... look around ... is archangel de jesus montoya- londono . he is my man . and you are a smuggler moving a load ...
a few more moments , still in this business . then i 'd find you .
and if i were in the comoros , in the indian ocean , where would you be ... ?
this is the talk of a man ... if he were your husband ... he would never put you at risk . he would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you .
is this the protective male talk ?
zanzibar . the comoros islands . somewhere in the indian ocean . there 's twelve-hundred islands there ...
where would i go ?
of course .
would you find me ... ?
whenever . maybe later , maybe sooner .
when ?
sure . as far away and as fast as you can .
really ?
something like that . the odds catch up with you . the odds are like gravity . you ca n't negotiate with them . so ... at some point , you should cash out , take your money and run ...
'cause whatever can go wrong , will ... ?
everybody needs it . ask prudential . or allstate .
do i need it ?
... to fall back on . you know , a fail-safe . insurance .
why ?
do you have assets somewhere else ? bank accounts ?
in kowloon , once , i got one that said , `` live now because life is dust . ''
they 're all the same . `` financial security is around the corner . '' `` your friends love you . ''
what 's the best fortune you ever got ?
and the chopsticks and fortune cookies ?
i forgot the napkins .
hola , viejo .
hola , chica .
maybe i 'm only one .
i would say you 're ... ... four percentage points away from a deal ...
what if i pushed to twenty-one ... ?
twenty-eight-point-five .
available cash is not an issue for us ...
i need thirty . calculate in , also , the cash you do n't have to front ...
the range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the p.o.e ... .to even consider it .
and you 're our thirty-percent partner ?
'cause we < u > guarantee < /u > every load . anywhere , for any reason , it comes up short , we make good . your operations will , from now on , run risk-free .
'cause you do n't lose loads ?
zero risk .
good samba dancing ... ?
better than that . we become partners . only in this territory and only on loads we run . and you do n't pay us three thousand a ki . you pay us zero . why we get is thirty percent of the load . product or cash . `` and why , '' you 're thinking , `` would i be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that ? is he chipping ? crazy for my love ? too many mojitas ? '' and the answer is , `` of course '' but also `` no . it is because sonny can deliver what no one else can . ''
did christmas come early this year ... ?
what do you mean ?
is it december ?
cost less . that 's the point .
and why should continuing excellence cost more ?
like `` three thousand a ki ? '' that 's nice . and i can supply the transportation into south florida and the gulf , more reliable and on-time than fedex . but , three per ki was ok for openers .
like ... ?
exactly .
... and therafore there is no consequence ?
that 's right .
... 'cause we have no future ... are of today and not tomorrow .
`` probable '' ... applies to an event that may be real . does n't apply here .
you know how improbable this is ... ?
to mothers . and all that we owe them ...
died in childbirth , having me ...
blanca ... a rubio like you . i see her in a dress ... an old photograph from lucinda somebody 's wedding ... everybody is with couples . husbands and wives . they all pose . my mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting . ... she looks right into the camera . she is the most beautiful woman in the room . by herself . in a party dress . and she looked like she knew she would die alone ... she spoke many languages . we were in luanda when she died . i went to her friends in mali . they sent me to the ecole polytechnique in geneva to study mathematics , where i met montoya in the discos . he had banking there ... i was seventeen and very much into the clubs . and he sent me to university for an mba in finance . your mother ?
okay . macon , georgia is where i was born . wound up in a juvenile facility . i was 14. then the military . then prison . because i was dumb and angry . then i read . then i got smart . then i discovered what i know , now ... it 's all business ...
i insist .
no .
tell < u > me < /u > everything .
i dance ...
later ! do you dance ?
mojitas ... ?
i am no one 's wife . i live in my own house . i do not live in a man 's house . he has a wife . we are together . i am free . because of banking and finance and travel ... and i can do anything i want ...
how 's he not your husband ?
angolan military . went back to the fighting . disappeared . who knows ... ?
your father ?
she 's dead ...
where 's she now ?
angola . my mother was being a surgeon there . she volunteered . mozambique and mali , too ... ... those days , in those days ... she was part of cuba 's gift to the third world . she came from a bourgeois family with a house in verdado ... we still have the house . we will go there ...
were you born in havana ?
i never do business in cuba . and nobody goes to cuba but me . and he is not my husband ...
you do business in cuba with your husband ?
my cousin is the harbor master . you must not bring in drugs . you can not be armed . if you 're carrying , it has to go . or stow it inside . no one will go near your boat ...
are you afraid ? good . and you do n't need a visa . cause you 're with me .
havana ? cubans do n't like us or my business ...
havana .
the keys ?
off a little alley with cobblestones . hemingway went there ...
where 's that ?
bodeguita del medio . it 's the < u > only < /u > place for mojitas ...
so where 's the best place for mojitas ?
show me ... ?
it goes very fast .
how fast does that go ?
i 'm a fiend for mojitas .
what do you like to drink ?
and what is that ?
there is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product ...
nothing . as in `` free , gratis . ''
what 's `` nothing '' ?
what 's the recovery ? how much are you looking for ?
okay .
we want it back .
right now .
when ?
you do .
i thought we had to meet the man .
really ? so , what is this , a party ?
put your guns on the table ... if we wanted you dead , you would no longer be drawing breath in miami . we would n't have brought you all the way here .
'cause she will tell you .
proof of life . how do i know mrs. rico 's alive ?
mrs. rico . but do n't worry . she is safe . to insure that , i am keeping her close to me . it 's always good to keep people your friends care about close to you .
what friend ?
i confess i have succumbed to my weaknesses . an inability to see another 's point of view . i 've discussed it with professionals . even with one of your friends . she 's here now ...
you got something to say , jos , let 's hear it .
hey , captain kirk . i think maybe i have second thoughts .
yeah ?
fifty-gallon drums . thirty-two . a hundred kilos in each . you transship that to the malaysian boat .
packaging ?
here 's what this is ... ask how much they want to turn back to us our load ...
he did n't . interrogation 's not in our skill set . so c'mon , what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations ?
what 'd neptune tell you ?
how 'bout this ? how 'd neptune know where to hit us ? huh ? whose op sec 's got a leak ? yours ?
and what do i do with him ?
yeah .
i 'll be there .
he tried to ... '' do business '' ... with you . around ten . his place . be there .
i do . we do n't do business with him ...
`` extras '' tried to relieve us of your weight ... and by the by , you know of a player in overtown who goes by the name of `` things aquatic '' ?
client got delivery . but there were ... '' extras '' in the back of the truck .
i 'm also called `` cochi loco . '' that means `` crazy pig . '' 'cause i enforce security and get people to tell me what i need to know . that part of what i do , you never want to find out about . other people will negotiate the money and go or not go . not me ...
red light , green light , jos ?
i am not john wayne . there is no `` s '' on his chest . we get down if the play calls for it . but we are into business and making money .
you afraid of violence ?
who you run loads for ? cause other than nicholas , you knows you ?
what ... ?
sit .
sonny burnett ... this is my partner , rico .
jos ...
call the us coast guard : `` come and arrest our ass . '' and switek resumes romancing miss ukraine ...
what 's the point ? it 's going down .
what 's your take ?
and jos , my ace , lots of transshipment . lots of action . skies are crowded . and the jit has assets on land , air , and sea . so any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare ... ?
if you see a few new faces , do n't get jumpy ...
i would never doubt you .
do you < u > believe < /u > ... i have forgotten i am a cop ?
i am asking . you to me .
you think i am in so deep i forgot ?
there is `` undercover . '' and there is `` which way is up ? ''
as in ... ?
what is going on ... ? !
we 're the ones doing the death- defying shit ? and he wants us to give that up ? for what ? a chump-change bust so he can get his picture in < i > the miami herald < /i > to impress the slug farm in dc ...
chill out sonny .
hey , fuck him .
so we want to change-up the mission statement .
and we can illuminate part of it from the inside out .
their loads are poly-drug . `` e '' from holland , methamphetamine precursors from jordan , afghan `` h. '' mid-ocean transshipments . his real business is : he 's a network .
mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow ...
and what does that level of spending on first-class , private- sector infrastructure signify to you ?
yeah . cia-level stuff ...
oh , that makes it okay , then .
we 're makin ' moves on each other .
you 're not makin ' a move on her ... ?
no .
... where you 're makin ' a move on the wife of archangel de jesus montoya ?
no . havana , louisiana . do n't we have a meet ?
havana , cuba ... ?
it 's in the suburbs outside havana .
verdado where ?
verdado .
where ?
hit a couple of jazz clubs . fell back to her place .
where 'd you go ?
on my way back ...
where the hell are you , man ?
nothing .
how much we looking for ?
good . so let 's go ...
no .
no . you gon na give me phony reassurances ?
gina in the miami pad . you gon na give me phony denials ?
like ... ?
you worried about the tree line , us customs awacs , or something else on your mind ?
to the limit .
who knows ...
they watching us watching them watching us waiting for them ? or what ?
five minutes ...
what do we got ?
port-au-prince .
where we meeting 'em ... ?
nothing .
anything ?
what happened to the last transporter you < u > had < /u > ?
then it do n't work .
money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns . because when money and guns get together , there is violence ...
what < u > you < /u > get < u > from < /u > us is a date . a place . `` in the parking lot of a jack-in-the-box in north miami . '' at such-and-such time , an eighteen- wheeler will be there . keys in the ignition . ready to roll . you pick it up . and you drive it ... ... away .
the people on shore who handle a load we run are our people , not your people . no tweakers , dopers , first- timers we do n't know . they did n't do time with us , they ai n't doing crime with us .
what kind of weight ?
and specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs .
so we can close each other 's eyes right now . real easy . real fast . but , then , nobody makes any money ...
`` no , viejo . that was jos yero , splattered all over his motherfucking wall . ''
people gon na walk into this place and say , `` ola , hijo ! that some crazy wallpaper . whew ... it wild ! is that a jackson pollack ? ''
that way we do not waste avgas or our motherfucking time .
and we did n't come down here to audition . business auditions for us ... ... and know who we are and know they want their load run by us < u > before < /u > nicholas calls .
we could try to run loads into these guys . run a few loads for montoya into south florida . into this group .
so ?
it says , `` we do not fear you . '' it says , `` fuck off and die . '' it says , `` we get down for recreation ... ''
track with me , here ... they knew the `` russians '' were undercover feeb ? they should have no-showed . but , no , these guys show anyway , and commit murder upon federal officers . and steal all your money ... what does that say to you ?
transpo ? how they bringing the loads in ... ?
aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers . so ...
white gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park . bounce around the old lady saturday night and get your recidivist ass busted back ...
white gangs ... ? it does n't track .
something 's wrong .
stevens ?
alonzo ...
what is it ?
hello , miss ukraine ...
the honey trap . and there 's the honey .
and there 's dmitri ...
skin has to touch skin . that 's the requirement for the warrant . then he makes a credible excuse and he stops ... . her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security ...
how lucky 's miss universe got ta be ?
backup in case the russians get physical .
what 's our deal ?
if you 're down , we 're down for the play .
then you should .
if we were for real , and knew our shit , we 'd fade this one ...
switek ?
too fast . too many moving parts .
go ahead .
you 're giving away your money , fool ...
twenty on my man ...
eleven to seven he blows it .
i 'm my < u > own < /u > man . and anytime you want to see how much man i am ?
control your men .
haiti and puerto rico . money through dubai and geneva maybe .
out of ... ?
montoya . we went to meet the village priest . it turns into alice in the fucking vatican and here 's the pope ... of the north valle colombia dope trade .
what are you talking about ?
who 's the `` we '' ? there 's you and there 's us . and all we got from you was bad intel . `` low-level producer . '' yeah , right ...
who said , `` go exploring '' ? we want this staying on track .
from the north valle area . new . low-level , we think .
never heard of him .
a colombian producer . named archangel de jesus montoya-londono .
from whom ... ?
how do we do that ? make a buy ? that went well ...
get into business with this crew , identify them . illuminate their network . if you 're lucky , discover their source , how they penetrated us . we 'll indict and take it from there ...
to recruit you .
so what do you want ?
we do n't know .
how ?
nlr , we think . i wan na know ...
omgs , mongols , nazi low-riders , prison gangs ?
... so there 's < u > no < /u > industrial- strength hrt weapons team out there tonight ?
that 's right .
and the deal goes down at another place at another time .
meet and greet . `` i flash you some of mine , you flash me some of yours ? ''
`` buy and walk '' ? `` buy and bust '' ? `` reverse undercover '' ? what ?
guy 's involved in a `` meet '' ...
how do i know ? i got the call from alonzo on an open line . that is the hand we have been dealt at this moment , at eleven-forty-seven o'clock friday night . okay ? i am trying to alert you , here . < u > you < /u > know whether or not ... you have a thing goin ' down . i do not . but we know this guy . i think you know this guy . normally , he is cool . tonight he is distraught . that is atypical . that engenders foreboding . do you understand the meaning of the word `` foreboding '' ? as in badness is happening to < u > your < /u > deal right fucking now ?
how do i discuss operations over an open line ?
a c.i . we cut loose to your joint interagency task force . name of alonzo stevens . now , he 's your informant . stevens , called us . i have n't spoken to him for six months . i do not know what case you have him on . i do not know what he is talking about . but whatever he is doing for you , it sounds like it is going bad . right now ...
okay . what 's up ?
4-4-7 charlie 12-92 .
what 's your miami pd badge number ?
detective crockett .
this is agent james fujima .
hello ?
if they ran the rental car or lease on this place ... even if it 's epic database in el paso ... they 'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep . then they 'd find your deeper , hidden criminal selves ...
how will it stand up ?
you 're so < u > not < /u > the pd , if you got busted on a dui , you 're in serious trouble ... you 're bad men back to grammar school . san quentin . pelican bay . marine corps . statesville . pelican bay , where you guys hooked up . now you 're too smart and too fast to get jacked again ...
hi , gina . this is from frick and frack . trudy ?
`` hi , gina . hi , sonny . ''
i have faith . in horoscopes and fortune cookies ...
have faith .
this i got ta see ... ... the `` make up an excuse and stop '' part .
how do i know ? but it was from the get-go . knew the fbi had run me into them . sonny , i got ta go ... !
how 'd they get onto you ?
goodbye .
alonzo ... !
... look after her . ask rico to . okay ? do that for me . i had to do it . they had me from the gate . do that . whatever you can do for them . okay ? look what i did to them , sonny ... !
where are you ?
after i check on francine and the boys , then i 'm gone . sonny , tell rico i 'm so sorry . i wanted you to know ...
alonzo , what 's goin ' on ? !
i gave up nothing on you guys . do n't worry . i kept you and rico out of it . only the feds . they 're on their own ... it 's all their deal , anyway , so fuck 'em .
i do n't understand ...
they had me from the gate .
alonzo ? what are you talking about ? where are you ... ?
it 's fucked up . i 'm sorry ...
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , sonny ...
on the phone .
where 's riccardo ?
yeah .
sonny ... ?
yeah ... ?
he 's talking to you , bro . what he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization ...
who are you talking to ?
they got a steady stream of supply . so , no ...
reverse undercover ? we supply to them ?
but miami pd was n't part of the j.i.t . and from what alonzo said , he did n't give you up .
as in , your ass is dead in the water .
we do n't know . and that 's the point . maybe there 's a mole . whatever , it 's a disaster . and it 's a joint interagency task force . i have dea , atf , u.s. customs components in on it . so the penetration could be from any one agency . what we do know is i have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause i have to assume our operational security is blown .
break your encryption ? hack your e- mail ? employee databases ? somebody on the inside ?
we think nlr . we do n't know ! alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet . he was n't deep into the crew .
c'mon , man !
... what else , what else did he indicate to you ? i need to know everything he said .
oh , good ...
white supremacist types .
haitian , dominican , russian , israeli ?
correct . flash samples . flash cash .
... you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious , they make mistakes . you 're worried about me . do not be . i am careful . i am cool . i got trudy , backup , whatever . you worry about you . because you are the ones who are in denied territory , not me . if your focus is on me , you 'll miss something coming at you . that 's how people slip up . get hurt . and i 'd die if anything happened . you worry about < u > you < /u > . you and sonny ... are in the dangerous place . i 'm fine ...
... even if they could run the identities you built to epic , all they 'll find is more cover ... trust what you built . it 's quality , girl . we 're cool ...
... the lease , the phones , the cars ... layers of false ident . would take the fbi weeks . how long did it take them ? three hours ? four ? this means , `` we can reach out and touch somebody . '' like bad teleflora .
good idea . we 'll grab a bite .
okay .
`` salutations from the south ... ''
what 's it say ?
you mean with the flowers ... ?
the bouquet , here . five-hundred dollars worth of roses ... yellow .
what flowers ?
... and thanks for the flowers .
okay ... see you soon .
bored .
nothing . calling to say hi ... what 's up with you ?
yes . what 's up ?
you sure ?
yeah .
you okay ?
reality tv and stay by the phone . that 's what all wives-in-crime do ...
what am i supposed to do after i get my nails and hair done ... ?
he did volunteer one time ...
only african he ever `` relocated '' was a $ 2,000-an-hour nigerian model for gucci , and he got wounded when she took an nba draft choice to the super bowl instead of him ...
switek pulling this off ... ? that 's not faith ; that 's delusional ...
so ?
i like the diminished risk . it frees up capital reserves . i like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent . you can predict their behavior ... .
what would you do ... ?
i think jos suspects anybody he does n't intimidate . and people , who are good at what they do ? they have egos , too ...
a good deal , like this with us , for burnett will be good only temporarily . he 'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever . life is dust , make it while you can . he 's ambitious .
why ?
they 're serious . they 're cautious . they 'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery 's handled ... they 'd walk away , rather than compromise operational security ... that 's good .
and ... ?
but what does your intuition tell you ... ?
burnett ? they want 22 % of the value on loads they run into south florida . it 's the juarez cartel model . they guarantee the loads . the upside is our risk goes to zero . that frees-up capital .
jos does n't like the deal in south florida ...
they 've been targeted . and pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now .
not french registry ?
transshipped to a malaysian container ship .
precursor shipments from ras tanura and ju'aymah ?
... and we 're looking at nigerian crude ...
they will kill you . and then they will kill your wife , too .
meaning ... ?
it 's all bullshit . jesus is out of communication in fals de iguazu . jos knows that ... whatever he 's going to do , he has to do it fast because he 's acting on his own . and he will need a story .
of course ! that is why i placed myself here , with you , knowing yero would pull this crap .
you set this up !
that sonofabitch !
maritime . jose will fill you in .
conveyance ?
`` future '' of ... ?
and as an investment in the future ...
two , three thousand a ki . two thousand ki 's , your end is $ 6,000,000 . complex transshipments or dealing with containers , these have front- loaded costs we pickup . for this kind of weight , the balance of 80 % is when our buyer picks up the load . transactions are offshore . dollars or euros . secure internet transfers . we have lists of cayman and isle of man banks infiltrated by irs , to be avoided ... no transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on u.s. soil ... that 's the deal .
define small .
i run down the numbers . nothing is very negotiable . small loads ? we pay three thousand a ki . we pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent . the next ten percent on u.s. landfall .
you work that out with la senora . you will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the malaysian ship . for collection in north miami . you warehouse it . release it when we say . i 'm sure you have friends with fast boats ...
importation value ? at twenty-two thousand a ki ...
< u > you < /u > give < u > yours < /u > to me . < u > we < /u > position all the assets hauling our loads ...
uh-uh . no predetermined places and times to meet . give me their heading and radio codes and i will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal ...
transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd .
you do n't like us finding your load ? we can go and lose it all over again ...
i walk into neptune 's house ... very nice . but i also see you ... and our drugs that got ripped from maguda .
it is . he try to take tonight 's load ?
this the load you lost a while back ?
wait by the phone . you get a call . or maybe you do n't . until then , piss off back to where you come from ...
what do i care what you think about how he looks ? you wan na fuck my partner or do business ?
i had to lay eyes on you .
then what were we talking to you for ?
do we need this ... ?
what do you care ?
nothing . 'cause how you do delivery on the beach , i do n't like . maybe this does not work .
and violence is extra . and expensive . so how much weight you looking to move ?
slow and low , adam a-500s ... ... carbon composite , stealthy , 1400 nautical-mile range , thousand ki payload ... all the way to caravels and 727 's from a source country to a transshipment point . small freighters . we 've done containers ...
equipment ?
nicholas said you okay . that 's nice . but how i know if you any good ?
so lay it out , my brother ...
they lied .
they said they would n't hurt them , would n't hurt them if ...
alonzo , you do n't need to go home .
what ... ?
alonzo ...
i got ta , i got ta go ... !
the feeb gig was i front a coupla undercover , russian-speakers to them . one 's atf . and broker the deal . set up the meet with the nlr types ...

sounds like they knew you .
i mean new york 's one thing , but can you see this guy , imagine it , running around the goddam beach all suntan and he 's going in swimming , like , and then somebody yells 'hey , ratso ' -- how does that sound to you ?
keep the goddam blanket on .
i been thinking . i hope we 're not gon na have a lotta trouble about my name down there . because like what 's the whole point of this trip anyway ?
if you have to shiver , why do n't you pull the blanket up more ?
shee-it . you believe all you read ?

i do n't even want you to go . whaddya think of that ? i got other plans for my life than dragging around some dumb cowboy that thinks he 's god 's gift to women . one twenty-buck trick and he 's already the biggest stud in new york city . it 's laughable .

i 'm going to florida , that 's my only chance .
well , just exactly what the hell you think you 're gon na do ? die on me ?
no doctors . no , sir . not me . doctors are like goddam auto mechanics . fix one-thing , unplug another . operate for piles and while they 're there , they unscrew your liver . my old man , for god 's sake , was n't any sicker'n i am when he went to the doctor .
okay . here it is . you gon na go see the doctor . i got nine bucks and twenty more thursday and i gon na be riding high before you know it . so you gon na get you the best goddam doctor in this town and get yourself straightened out , that 's what .

you could n't lift fly specks from a sugar bowl . can you hold this ?
no . but while you was buying the underwear , i could have lifted the socks .
they wrong ?
walk ? naturally i can walk .
well , if you 're awright , why you hanging on the bannister . can you walk or not ?
twenty bucks ...
tell her , ratso .
rico . rico rizzo .
well , i made it . this here is ratso rizzo and i ...
few dozen cooties wo n't kill me , do n't guess .
do n't need a comb .
you got a comb ?
well , what the hell , i got nothing better to do .
but they picked me , right ? so what i 'll do , i 'll just say , now look , you want me ? well , i do n't go nowhere without my buddy here .
do n't say nothing about you either .
did i say that ? did i ? it do n't say nothing about you ...
what you 're driving at , you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party .
now i 'm here . i 'm in new york city . getting picked for things . do n't you see what i 'm driving at ?
yeah , well , so ?
well , this thought just struck me . it was n't too long ago i was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in texas .
he ca n't read . even dumber than you . could n't write his own name . x -- that 's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone . one big lousy x like our flat . condemned . by order of city hall .
well , uh , he dam well know he ai n't 'be-loved aunt winifred ' .
can he smell the difference , eh ?
respect shee-it ! you even steal flowers for his grave .
the name 's rico , at my own father 's grave , a man deserves some respect .
kee-rist , you sure are one twisty little bastard , ratso .
you wan na know the truth ? you dumb bastard , i got it for you . look at it . goddam thing 's ten sizes too big for me .
forty-second street . where'n hell you think it come from ?
where 'd that come from ?
who 'd you ever do a favor for ? you just let some poor bastard freeze to death , would n't you ?
the coat ? a guy i did a favor once gave it to me . christ .
shee-it . cough yourself inside out , then light a fag , a goddam fag . you make me puke . where 'd you steal it ? in the movies ?
what i 'm gon na do , i 'm gon na make a cowboy outta you , kid . how about that ? build you up a little , teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud , rat-stuff .
not bad -- for a cowboy -- you 're okay , you 're okay .
do n't rush me . how i do it , see , i get myself primed , like i was turning on the charm for some pretty little blonde lady , then kinda mosey away slow and easy and - swing around ! -- and there you are , you handsome devil .
you like it ? take a look .
kee-rist , you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp .
and end up a hunchback like my old man ? you think i 'm crippled ? you shoulda caught him the end of a day .
hey , you 're good ! i bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried .
well , uh , my manager 's gon na manage all that crap , or else he gon na get a coconut up his flue .
you ai n't got a chance in hell . you need threads and glitter , baby . a front , hey ?
you talk like a man with a tin twat .
look at yourself , joe , no offense , but frankly , you 're beginning to smell . for a stud in this town that 's a handicap .
what 's all this sweet talk about florida ? your friend o'daniel got a stable down there now ?
miami beach is the only place for a real hustler . florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world . they lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes .
i think finding you 's the smartest thing i ever did , for both of us . you just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder i need to get me hustling in this town . hey !
in florida , they come smooth , ready to eat . down there , your only problem is , diet-wise , you got ta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin . tough , hey ?
i been sick . hold this , will ya ?
this is an okay setup you got here , but i 'd say you ai n't just exactly , uh , flush , is that right or not ?
the two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk . that 's a known fact . if i can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out .
rico ! rico ! rico ! is that enough ? and keep your meat hooks off my radio .
rico then , at least call me rico in my own goddam place .
shee-it , man , i ca n't say all that .
joe -- do me one favor -- this is my place , am i wrong ? you know , in my own place my name ai n't ratso . i mean it so happens my name is enrico salvatore rizzo .
so if you want me to hang around for a few days , i thought you should know .
i 'm impressed . you 're a killer .
well , i hope you know what you 're in for . i 'm a very dangerous person . someone does me bad like you . if i caught up with you that night , there 'd be one dead ratso long about now . hear ?
i want you to stay , okay ? i goddam invited you , did n't i ?
oh . guess i got the wrong impression .
i ai n't forcing you , like , i mean , who 's forcing you ?
you want me to stay here tonight , is that the idea ?
well now , ratso , i 'm gon na tell you something for your own good , only first gim me a cigarette .
i drug in a cot , if you want to stay .
so you could sleep ! i mean christ !

you want some free medical advice , shut your goddam mouth about that night .
it 's sticky . what you do , slobber on 'em ? i would n't touch 'em .
you keep the sixty-four cents . i want you to have it .
not a cent , i swear to god , i swear on my mother 's eyes .
what 's in your socks ?
i mean , dammit , where you live ?
forget it .
now take it . go on . listen , where can i reach you ? cause i 'm gon na make this right with you soon 's i get me set up ...
oh hell , forget it .
ten , ten -- i got a twenty -- take that ...
let 's see how you look . fine . you look fine . now i 'm gon na have to have that other ten ...
hold it , just hold it . you think i 'm that kinda sombitch ? just name your cut , whatever you want , you got it right now . five ? ten , how 's that ?
tomorrow when some piece like that 's scratching your back in a fifth avenue townhouse , where 'll your pal rizzo be ? nedicks .
well , joe , you 're a nice guy , and i 'd be doing you both a favor , but why ? what 'm i dragging my bum leg all over town for ? it 's no picnic and what for , for me myself , what ?
hey , listen , how about you take me to mee this mister o'diddle bird right now ?
my friend o'daniel . that 's who you need . operates the biggest stable in town . in the whole goddam metropolitan area . a stud like you - paying ! -- not that i blame you -- a dame starts crying , i cut my heart for her ...
i think you just put your finger on it , i do .
how would i know ? you got ta tell a person these things a hustler ? picking up trade on the street like that -- baby , believe me -- you need management .
i 'm a hustler , hell , did n't you know that ?
for money for what ?
for money .
for what ?
... you see what i 'm getting at here ? she got a penthouse up there with color tv and more goddam diamonds than an archbishop and she busts out bawling when i ask for money !
same all around ! for my friend , too !
enrico rizzo from the bronx . do n't mind if i do .
shee-it ... kee-rist , you really know the ropes . wish to hell i bumped into you before . i 'm joe buck from texas and i 'm gon na buy you a drink , what do you say to that ?
oh , it ai n't cheap . i mean , yeah , i 'd say this was an all right shirt . do n't like to , uh , you know , have a lot of cheap stuff on my back .
that is one hell of a shirt . i bet you paid a pretty price for it , am i right ?
you 're wasting your time . there 's nothing in there .

i simply do n't have it , joe .
i got ta have more'n ten . i got ta have fifty-seven dollars .

oh . yes . of course . i should have thought . you should n't have to ask . that was thoughtless of me . yes . wait here ...

this is terrible . i meet someone who -- then -- wait , i want to give you a present . for your trip . you 'll let me please ...
i 'm going to florida .

you want me to leave ?
oh , difficult , it 's so difficult . you 're a nice person , joe -- i should never have asked you up -- a lovely person . oh , how i loathe life . i loathe it . please go . please .
what you got me up here for ?

sometimes it seems to me time stopped twenty years ago . there was this war , there was this handsome young man with quite black hair and he was supposed to die . but he did n't . is n't that amusing ?
it 's so exciting . new york . the mad forward thrust of everything . my sense of time here is completely altered .
gin 's okay .

lonesomeness is something you take . you bear ? dammit , you take it and go about your business , that 's all .
yessir , i can see that .
i 'm lonesome . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a drunk . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a dope fiend . i 'm lonesome so i 'm a thief , a fornicator , a whore-monger . poop , i say , poop ! i 've heard it all and i 'm sick of it , sick to death .

it would take a minute or so . you wo n't last that long out there .
hell , i might be able to juice the whole area , if i can get to the power box . it 's just a couple of cables ...
but the power ...
scent glands . insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other .
what are you putting that crap on me for ?
we 'll find him . we 'll be back and find him .
i did n't protect him , lady . he trusted me . and i did n't protect him ... his father ... i lost his father to the streets and now , chuy ...
manny ...
he 's out there . i heard him . how can he be ? this things ...
this , is our baby peter . yours and mine . are n't you proud ?
`` ... and behold he will come that walks as a man , yet is not a man- ... ''
mantids can mimic . we gave the judas that code ...
no ...
but it look like a man . it ... i saw it .
just inner chambers ...
we can do it !
no ...
peter ...
talk to me .
ah ...
c'mon ...
i can . we can do this ...
your arm , you ca n't ...
you go first . i 'll be right below you .
jump in .
oh , come on , come on !
that 's it . that 's it . breathe easy .
i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers ... and i remembered where they are ...
try not to sweat ?
do n't touch it . and for godsakes , try not to sweat . they can sense chemical changes ...
that 's why we should do it now .
the scent wo n't last ...
it worked before ...
peter-
we 'll cover ourselves with this . they can mimic us- we goddam mimic them !
just do it ! !
what-
rub it on the windows !
right . hardwired to eat anything that 's not like them !
they do n't know anything peter , they just sense . they 're hardwired !
it 's no use ! they know we 're in here !
how ? !
his blood ! it 's driving them crazy ! we have to mask the odor !
that 's camouflage ...
so , you 're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or ...
toss the flare down !
no , jesus , no .
listen to me : we 're getting you out .
do n't .
yeah , barely . we have n't found anything down here . nothing ...
it 's me . can you hear me ?
i know . but if it was carrying something ... there 's a chance you could have been exposed .
it did n't bite me .
susan , listen to me : you handled that insect almost as much as siri ...
no .
why take the chance ? just let me go down there with you ...
you said that thing was big as your hand . i do n't think i 'm going to miss ...
... you do n't even know what you 're looking for .
susan , we 're not b-
ironic , do n't you think ? these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs , right ? and here we are ...
i was just late .
oh , no , you were-
right .
fuck 'em . they do n't know what they 're missing .
i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids .
no such thing , baby .
great crowd .
fine , then i 'm the bad guy . jesus !
he was just doing his job .
oh , so i 'm the bad guy now ?
i heard how you talked to him .
you give someone a fucking uniform and ... did you hear how he talked to us ?
no , there 's ...
honey , just leave it .
so ?
metaxonycha godmani .
even if they did ... that 's all we have , is n't it ?
maybe they lied to you .
keep going . we 'll tell you when to stop ...
we ?
evolution does n't work that fast . something pushed that thing to take the leap . we need to find another specimen .
do n't you get it ? it 's more than that .
okay . so you lost a great specimen-
this thing was the size of my fist , peter ! ! that 's off the charts !
i needed to think . it was either this or the weather channel .
thought it was my week for that .
i 'll be late .
okay , meet me out front . i got ta go . josh 's picking me up in five . see you tonight .
do n't get kinky here ...
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear , do n't forget that .
monks bottle their own wine . do n't they ?
you know where they get this fertility stuff ? they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns .
we 're down to a `` couple '' now , huh ?
who know ? we get lucky , maybe a couple of 'em 'll be ours .
is this a catholic guilt thing ... ?
we did no impact evaluation . the consequences of ...
you know what i mean ...
taking a cab instead of hiring a limo ?
do you think we did the right thing ?
you did !
please .
a shame . you looked great tonight .
no way . i see one of those , i 'd puke .
an `` ootheca '' . an eggcase . it probably had more , uh `` weirdbugs '' inside .
gross . what is it ?
you sure you did n't see one of these ?
that 's it ?
you guys have done a nice job . how bout five dollars ?
you the bug lady , right ?
hello .
i know . help me get a sample .
that 's impossible . insects do n't ...
what ?
my god .
and they 're not fully developed . this thing 's not even an adult .
fuck ! it broke the skin ...
this wing configuration . i 've never ...
no shit .
it bit you .
i have no idea . are you ready ?
what is it ?
i 'm gon na pull it out and i want you to pin it down , okay ?
oh , right ... they been here since noon . i told them you 're real busy .
what 's this ?
oh , jesus .
not a big one . i mean , it was like a turkey baster .
she used a baster .
what ?
i just ... well , i had this cousin in delhi . she was having problems , too . she , ah ...
watch your step , siri . your grant could be on the line here .
i 'm on it . do n't worry . look , susan ... i do n't mean to pry , but ... i kinda overheard you and peter .
... as long as they 're ready for the opening i do n't care , just tell them that .
just like trump tower , then .
siri , sandblast that thing . it looks like trump tower . those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions ...
i 'd be delighted . now that you know the way ...
if you do n't mind , perhaps i could pay you another visit sometime .
but you did n't even taste your cocoa .
thanks , miz wilkes , but i do n't want to take up any more of your time . i best be going .
you got a point there ...
i always say if you ca n't enjoy your own company , you 're not fit company for anyone else .
must get lonely , living out here all by yourself .
sounds good .
how does a nice cup of cocoa sound ?
sure .
well , i just thought -- oh , look at me . you 'd think i 'd never had a house guest before . would you like something to drink ?
i 'm not much of a critic .
i could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine , and you could tell me what you think .
well ... ... maybe it takes time to get the hang of it .
it 's right this way .
sure .
god told me , since i was his number- one fan , that i should make up new stories as if i was paul sheldon . so , went to town . and i bought a typewriter . and paper to type on . the same kind paul sheldon used . and i turned the guest bedroom into a writing studio . would you like to see it ?
thank you .
i know . it 's so upsetting . i 'm his number-one fan ... i 've got all his books , every sentence he ever put down . i 'm so proud of my paul sheldon collection ... ... here i am , prattling on and my manners have just flown away . i have n't invited you in . please .
excuse me , that 's not exactly the kind of information i was after . you see , he 's been missing for quite some time now , and ...
anything you can tell me might help .
what do you want to know ?
i was just wondering if you happen to know anything about paul sheldon .
guess you can tell from my reaction , i 'm not all that used to visitors out here . what can i do for you ?
sorry , did n't mean to startle you . you did n't give me a chance to knock .
oh , my !
you did perfect . except for one thing . this time we need two glasses .
did i do good ?
ahh ! ! !
you 'll know everything in a minute . get the champagne .
oh , paul , this is so romantic . ian and windthorne dueling for the right to misery 's hand . does ian win ? oh , do n't me . it 's windthorne , right ?
i 'm almost done .
yes , paul .
dome pear-igg-non it is .
i was fooling , silly . you need a cigarette , because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book , and you just have one , and the match is to light it . and you need one glass of champagne . dome pear-igg-non .
you do n't know ?
what things ?
you 'll know very soon . i 'm starting the last chapter . and when i finish , i want everything to be perfect . i 'll require three things .
oh , paul . i 'm dying . does she wind up with ian or windthorne ? you have to tell me .
it will .
paul , this will be our legacy .
i 'm glad you like it .
it was windthorne . i knew it -- what does that do to her love for ian ? -- -- of course , if she had n't thought windthorne was murdered she never would have fallen in love with ian in the first place . sorry , it 's just that this is so wonderful .
maybe . are you ready for the next chapter ?
this is so exciting . it 's windthorne , her first love , right ?
maybe .
the stranger staying at the inn , is he someone from misery 's past ?
three more chapters to go .
oh , paul . it 's beautiful .
it 's almost done . by dawn we 'll be able to give misery back to the world .
but the time is now . soon others will come .
i know you do . i love you too , annie . and you 're right . we are meant to be together . and i know we must die . but it must be so that misery can live . we have the power to give misery eternal life . we must finish the book .
that 's disgusting .
be my guest .
i 'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you 're not nicer --
oh , no reason , you keep me prisoner , you make me burn my book , you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles ...
why are you so mean , mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me ?
why , what are you going to do ? kill me ? take your best shot .
do n't talk to me like that .
i do n't know , it 's weird , but a couple of broken bones has n't done a lot for my creative juices . get the fuck out of here .
paul , do n't you think it 's time for you to start writing again ? it 's been over a week .
why would i run away ? i 'm a writer , annie -- it 's all i am -- and i 've never written this well -- even you said that this is my best , did n't you ?
now do n't fuss , paul .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
paul , my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south .
no , i have n't .
you 've been out of your room .
what ?
paul , i know you 've been out .
it is .
that 's very kind of you , but i 'll bet it 's not altogether true .
why would i want to leave ? i like it here .
the book is almost finished . your legs are getting better . soon you 'll be able to walk . you 'll be wanting to leave .
why would you lose me ?
when you first came here , i only loved the writer part of paul sheldon . but now i know i love the rest of him too . as much as misery loves ian . i know you do n't love me -- do n't say you do -- you 're a beautiful , brilliant , famous man of the world ; and i 'm ... not a movie star type . you 'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you 're someone like me .
the rain ... sometimes it gives me the blues .
annie , what is it ?
i think you 're right .
paul , this is positively the best misery you 've ever written .
to misery .
oh , god , what have i done ? i 'm so sorry , paul . i ruined your beautiful toast . will you ever forgive me ? here , let me pour another one . can we pretend this never happened ? to misery ?
it 's perfect .
are you kidding ? if anyone ever told me that one day i 'd be having a candlelit dinner with paul sheldon in my own house , i woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled . will this do ?
absolutely . listen , if you ca n't find any , it 's okay . i just thought it might be nice .
you really think so ?
well , it certainly says you .
oh , you . i just picked things up over the years .
did you study decorating , or do you just have a flair ?
oh , i do n't know . i think so . i 'll go look .
wait , let 's do this right . do you have any candles ?
to misery .
yes , to misery . let me pour you some more wine .
a toast ?
annie , i think we should have a toast .
oh . you ca n't get this in a restaurant in new york .
my secret is i only use fresh tomatoes , never canned . and to give it that little extra zip , i mix in some spam with the ground beef .
i 've never had meatloaf this good , what do you do to it ?
oh ...
it looks wonderful . and so do you .
i hope you like it .
oh , paul . it would be an honor .
to celebrate misery 's return . i could n't have done it without you .
i 'm going to play my records all day
whenever he played radio city , who do you think was right there in the front row ?
misery 's alive ! misery 's alive . oh , it 's so romantic -- this whole house is going to be filled with romance . i 'm going to put on my liberace records -- -- you do like liberace , do n't you ?
not even a hint ?
have to wait .
will she still love him with that special perfect love ?
... have to wait .
oh , paul , can i read each chapter when you finish ? i can fill in the `` n '' s. will she be her old self , now that ian has dug her out , or will she have amnesia ... ?
yeah , yeah ...
i 've known from the very first book that misery had to be born of nobility and i was right !
you better . oh , paul , when ian realized that the reason they 'd buried misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma --
well , is it fair ? should i keep going ?
nothing .
what ?
what about a bee ... ?
you said you can make it so they got ta turn the page . you know , `` i ' got ta ' know will she live , '' `` i ' got ta ' know will he catch the killer . '' `` i got ta see how this chapter ends . '' you said it . i do n't usually buy that magazine . i only got it , 'cause they were interviewing you .
i said that ?
the `` got ta . '' remember , you talked about it in playboy magazine . you said there 's a million things you ca n't do in this world ; you ca n't hit a curve ball , you ca n't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work -- but there 's one thing you always have , and that 's the power of the `` got ta . ''
the what ?
you can -- you have the `` got ta '' --
i 'm telling you , i ca n't .
do n't be silly . of course you can .
i ca n't write this anymore .
what 's the matter , paul ? you have n't written a word .
but not you . not with my misery . remember , ian did ride for dr. cleary at the end of the last book , but his horse fell jumping that fence and ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor , so there could n't have been any `` experimental blood transfusion '' that saved her life . misery was buried in the ground at the end , paul , so you 'll have to start there .
they always cheated like that in cliff -- -- chapter plays .
`` he did n't get out of the cockadoodie car ! ''
i know that , mister man -- they also call them serials . i 'm not stupid , you know . anyway , my favorite was rocket man , and once it was a no-brakes chapter , the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out , but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and -- i was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe i was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was rocket man trying to get out , and here came the cliff and just before the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered -- -- but i did n't cheer , i stood right up and started shouting , `` this is n't what happened last week -- have you all got amnesia ? -- they just cheated us -- this was n't fair -- ''
-- cliff-hangers --
that 's right -- when i was growing up in bakersfield , my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on saturday afternoons for the chapter plays ...
-- not fair ?
paul , what you 've written just is n't fair .
i really value your criticism , but maybe you 're being a little hasty here .
paul , it 's not worthy of you . throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me . you can leave that in .
what ? what happened to `` i 'll treasure whatever you do ? ''
i 'm sorry , paul . this is all wrong , you 'll have to do it over again .
do n't be silly . you 'll be brilliant . think of me as your inspiration .
yeah , well i would n't expect too much .
here , in case you think of any ideas .
i want my pain to go 'way , annie -- make it go 'way , please annie -- -- please ...
it 'll only take a second .
i want my pills now !
poor dear ... let 's get you back in bed and i 'll get them for you .
you know goddamn well what i 've been doing -- i 've been sitting here suffering . i need my pills .
paul , you 're dripping with perspiration , your color is very hectic -- what have you been doing ?
what 's the matter ? i 'll tell you what 's the matter . i go out of my way for you . i do everything to try and make you happy . i feed you , i clean you , i dress you . and what thanks do i get ? `` you bought the wrong paper , annie . i ca n't write on this paper , annie . '' well , i 'll get your stupid paper , but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here , mister man .
annie , what 's the matter ?
are you sure ? 'cause if you want , i 'll bring back the whole store for you .
no , just the paper will be fine .
thank you for thinking of me . anything else i can get while i 'm in town ? any other crucial requirements that need satisfying ? would you like a tiny tape recorder ? or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers ?
i thought you 'd be interested . i 'd like you to be in on everything , annie . not just the finished book , but how it 's written .
well , it does smudge after all -- is n't that fascinating ?
c'mere , i 'll show you .
but mine cost the most so i do n't see how it could smudge .
you did great , except there 's just one little thing -- i ca n't work with this paper . it 's corrasable bond , it smudges . maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white , long-grained mimeo .
you -- fooler ... ! did i do good ?
it 's two of the letters in my favorite nurse 's name , annie .
and i got a great deal on this fifty- pound clunker -- on account of it 's missing an `` n. '' i told the saleslady `` n '' was one of the letters in my favorite writer 's name .
great .
do n't worry about that . you 'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work .
i guess you do n't get bothered by neighbors much .
you do understand that this is n't the ordinary way books get written -- i mean , some people might actually consider this an oddball situation .
i expect nothing less than your masterpiece .
you just expect me to whip something off , that it ?
yes . it will be a book in my honor . for saving your life and nursing you back to health . i 'll be the first one to read it . oh , paul , you 're going to make me the envy of the whole world ...
i know you did n't mean it when you killed her , and now you 'll make it right .
misery 's return ?
oh , but paul ! i do n't think , i know ! now that you 've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript , you can go back to doing what you 're great at -- -- you 're going to write a new novel -- your greatest achievement ever -- misery 's return .
work ? you mean write ? what in the world do you think i 'd write ?
that 's the big surprise . your new studio -- after all , writers do need a place to work .
set what up ?
now do n't josh . this is a very big day for you , paul . here . you just sit tight , and i 'll set everything up .
if i knew this was gon na be the surprise , you could 've gotten me to burn all my books .
and look what i 've got for you . an electric razor so you can shave yourself now .
great . i 've always wanted to visit the other side of the room .
see , is n't this nice ?
great .
yeah , well , it 's a theory . here 's your novril . how does tuna casserole sound for dinner ?
i do n't know .
i do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year . people say it has something to do with the ozone layer . what do you think ?
as long as it does exist , your mind wo n't ever be free . i think you should light the match , paul .
you 're right . you 're right . i do n't know what i was thinking . i 'll tell you what . it does n't have to be published . nobody ever has to see it . i 'll just keep it for myself . no one will ever have to know it exists .
oh , paul . this is n't about money . it 's about decency and purity . it 's about god 's values .
you know , annie , this book never would have survived without you . when it gets to new york , there will be a big auction , and whatever it brings we can split . god knows you 're entitled to it .
i know this is the only copy , paul . when you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you did n't make a copy , because you did n't think anybody would take it seriously . but they did . and ever since you 've never made any copies because you 're superstitious -- it 's why you always come back to the silver creek lodge . you told that story to merv griffin eleven years ago .
so you 've indicated . do it .
no big deal .
then light the match , paul .
this is n't difficult , my agent 's made dozens of copies . there 's gon na be an auction on this , and every publishing house in new york is reading it now . so if you want me to burn it , fine . you 're not ridding the world of anything .
i know this may be difficult for you , but it 's for the best .
you want me to burn my book ?
yes .
you want me to burn my book ?
yes .
show me the way ?
but this time i thought clearly . i asked god about you and god said `` i delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way . ''
i 'll get you everything you want , but you must listen first . sometimes my thinking is a little muddy , i accept that . it 's why i could n't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in denver .
i do n't suppose i could have a little snack while i wait for the surprise ?
you 're such a kidder . i have a big surprise for you . but first there 's something you must do .
perfect .
what are you doing on the floor ? it 's my fault . if i 'd had a proper hospital bed , this never would have happened . here , let me help you back in . i know this hurts , but it 'll only take a few seconds . there you go . comfy ?
she slipped away ? she slipped away ? she did n't just slip away . you did it . you did it . you did it . you did it . you murdered my misery .
no one -- she just died -- she slipped away , that 's all .
then who did ?
i did n't ...
i do n't want her spirit ! i want her ! and you murdered her !
annie , in 1871 , women often died in childbirth , but her spirit is the important thing , and misery 's spirit is still alive --
you ... you dirty bird . she ca n't be dead . misery chastain can not be dead ! how could you ?
of course i 'll like it . misery 's about to have her child . what 's it gon na be , a boy or a girl ? ooh , do n't tell me .
well , i hope you like it .
i 'd love to stay here and chat , but i 'm right at the end and i got ta find out what happens .
it boils down to respect . people just do n't respect the institution of marriage any more . they have no sense of real commitment .
well , it 's not something you should enter into lightly .
do n't get me wrong . i 'm not against marriage per se . but it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again .
no problem .
yeah , thanks .
done ?
i 'm ...
i just kept reading them over and over . i know when i finish this one -- and i 've only got two chapters to go -- i 'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again .
i do n't know about you , but what i did to get through it was i dove into work -- days , nights -- night shifts can be lonely at a hospital . i did a lot of reading . that was hen i first discovered misery . she made me so happy . she made me forget all my problems . 'course , i suppose you had a little something to do with that too .
i know how that can be .
for a while i thought i might go crazy .
yeah , that and misery 's child -- those are the only two divine things ever in this world ...
the sistine chapel ?
i 'm on page three-hundred now , paul , and it 's better than perfect -- it 's divine . what 's the ceiling that dago painted ?
she 's a fine ... uh ... pig is what she is ...
this farm was getting kind of dreary , what with just the few cows and chickens and me -- but when i got misery here , everything changed -- she just makes me smile so .
i 'm getting to believe you .
yes . i told you i was your number- one fan .
misery ?
i thought it was time you two should meet . paul , say hello to my favorite beast in all the world , my sow , misery .
my pleasure .
thank you so much .
you 'd be amazed at what some people will believe .
i knew it . i knew it was n't true . boy , how do they get away with printing stuff like that ?
well , you ca n't believe everything you read in magazines .
i do n't mean to pry , but i 've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials . and i said it ca n't be true . paul sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that .
i can live with `` great . ''
no . no , it is n't , it 's -- -- oh pooh , i ca n't think of any words . would `` great '' be insulting ?
i guess that means it 's okay .
i made you my speciality -- scrambled eggs a la wilkes . and i 'm on page 75 .
your agent said she would tell her you were okay . but i 'm afraid you 'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself .
i was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago .
... it 's like a visit from my oldest , dearest friend .
my daughter must be going nuts .
well , mine 's still out . but the ones in town were working just fine . i called that agent of yours . oh , paul , i peeked at the very beginning . what a wonderful first page -- just to read the name misery chastain ...
the phones are working ?
the one to town is , but that 's about it . i called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . i told him who you were and what had happened . he said as long as there 's no infection , you 're not in any danger , and as soon as the road to the hospital is open , they 'll send an ambulance for you .
then the roads are open ...
they had it at the store , paul , there was a whole batch of them there . as soon as i saw it , i slammed my money down . i got the first copy .
it 's fine .
oh , i 'm sorry . i did n't mean to wake you .
well , these are slum kids , i was a slum kid , everybody talks like that .
it has no nobility .
the profanity bothers you ?
the swearing , paul . there , i said it .
pretty rough so far .
well , it 's brilliantly written , but then everything you write is brilliant .
i can take it , go ahead .
oh , it 's ridiculous , who am i to make a criticism to someone like you ?
no , what is it ?
nothing .
but what ?
oh , like i could do that ?
it 's crazy , but i do n't really know , i mean i have n't written anything but `` misery '' for so long that -- you read it you can tell me what you think it 's about . maybe you can come up with a title .
what 's it about ?
i do n't have a title yet .
what 's your new book called ?
you 'll never realize what a rare treat you 've given me .
i have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage -- only my editor , my agent , and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck .
if you would n't mind .
you want to read it ?
it should n't be too much longer . once the roads are open , the lines 'll be up in no time . if you give me their numbers , i 'll keep trying them for you . could i ask you a favor ? i noticed in your case there was a new paul sheldon book and ... and i wondered if maybe ...
when do you think the phone lines 'll be back up ? i have to call my daughter , and i should call new york and let my agent know i 'm breathing .
and you 're very brilliant , and you must be a good man , or you could never have created such a wondrous , loving creature as misery chastain . like a baby . all done .
you 're very kind ...
lucky for you , i did . lucky for me too . because now you 're alive and you can write more books . oh , paul , i 've read everything of yours , but the misery novels ...
i did n't know it was going to be a big storm .
do n't move now -- would n't want to hurt this neck -- well , the other afternoon i was on my way home , and there you were , leaving the lodge , and i wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming .
say that last part again , i did n't quite hear --
well , it was n't any secret to me that you were staying at the silver creek , seeing as how i 'm your number- one fan and all . some nights i 'd just tool on down there , sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin -- and i 'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world 's greatest writer .
following me ?
no , it was n't a miracle at all ... in a way , i was following you .
of course you will . and your arm will be fine , too . your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly , but i finally popped it back in there . but what i 'm most proud of is the work i did on those legs . considering what i had around the house , i do n't think there 's a doctor who could have done any better .
will i be able to walk ?
your legs just sing grand opera when you move , do n't they ? it 's not going to hurt forever , paul , i promise you .
the blizzard was too strong . i could n't risk trying to get you there . i tried calling , but the phone lines are down .
should n't i be in a hospital ?
they 're called novril -- they 're for your pain .
what are they ... ?
here .
-- my number one fan .
you 've been here two days . you 're gon na be okay . my name is annie wilkes and i 'm --
how long ... ?
shhh ... we 're just outside silver creek .
there 's that spice again .
it 's good you found it .
i 'm not sure . maybe nothing .
what is it ?
that thing . here it is . right where it 's supposed to be .
what thing ?
how many times do i have to tell you -- i have a system here . where the hell is that thing ?
oh , i like that tone .
just leave it , all right ?
`` there is a justice higher than that of man -- i will be judged by him . ''
that 's nice .
they 're hauling misery into court .
what ?
`` there is a justice higher than that of man . i will be judged by him . ''
now , you see , it 's that kind of sarcasm that 's given our marriage real spice .
what do you expect to find ? a story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm ?
virginia , i 'm flattered you think i got that much energy . i just figured if i ca n't find paul sheldon , at least i can find out what he wrote about .
well , whoever she is , she sure likes to read a lot .
hey , jim , what 's doing ? uh-huh ... uh- huh ... jim , we 've been over this . if you 're gon na have benches in front of your store , people are gon na sit on them . i do n't like him either , but i 'm not going to come over there and tell him to move . give my best to denise . bye .
there 's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars : the ones that ca n't afford new ones , and the ones who would n't give 'em up for anything in the world . that second bunch do n't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents .
it was an old car -- those dents could have been there forever .
he might well be . but not the way they say . he did n't crawl out of that car by himself . you saw those dents on the door -- someone pulled him out .
you do n't think he 's dead , do you ?
just from his agent .
here 's the list of all sheldon 's credit charges . nothing after the silver creek . any calls ?
hope not -- if he is , he 's dead . let 's go to the newspaper office .
you really think sheldon 's out there ?
could be -- or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it . could be a lot of things .
could be the weight of the snow .
what ? what is it ?
stop -- stop right here .
well , this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the sheriff .
virginia , when you 're in this car , you 're not my wife , you 're my deputy .
four or five days ago . why ?
work , work , work . virginia ? when was that blizzard ?
we actually got a phone call . busy morning .
g'bye , ms. sindell .
i appreciate that . thanks a lot .
i hate that i made this call -- tell me i 'm being silly .
you think he might be missing ?
no , no , of course not . it 's just that his daughter has n't heard from him , and when he 's got a book coming out , he usually keeps in touch . so when there was no word from him ...
i do n't know . does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels ?
not quite . i just called , and they said he checked out five days ago . is n't that a little strange ?
yeah , i understand he 's been up here the last six weeks .
i 'm sure you know paul 's been going to the silver creek lodge for years to finish his books .
people sure like those misery books .
yes , he is .
he 's your client , huh ?
yes .
paul sheldon ? you mean paul sheldon the writer ?
i 'm a literary agent , and i feel like a fool calling you , but i think one of my clients , paul sheldon , might be in some kind of trouble .
i 'm sure you 're right .
i 'll bet that old mustang 's pulling into new york right now .
so do i ...
i do n't think mr. sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary . considering who he is and all , famous and all , he does n't have airs . drives the same car out from new york each time -- '65 mustang -- said it helps him think . he was always a good guest , never made a noise , never bothered a soul . sure hope nothing happened to him .
no long-distance phone calls , federal express packages -- anything at all out of the ordinary ?
no , see , he always ordered a bottle of dom perignon when he was ready to go . then he 'd pay up and be out the door .
maybe you can , libby .
nothing unusual about mr. sheldon 's leaving , buster -- you can tell by the champagne .
oh . that kind . nothing odd about that .
no , the typing kind .
newspapers ?
miz wilkes ? same old stuff . -- lest you call paper odd .
has she been buying any odd things lately ?
are you kidding ? every time that fella writes a book , she makes me set aside the first copy .
you would n't happen to remember if miz wilkes bought one , would you ?
we had a batch . sold 'em all in three days .
do you have any of those new paul sheldon books ?
if i can .
answer me a couple things ?
buster .
hey , pete .
i am . well , maybe not completely --
i thought you were over it .
now you 've hurt me , paul .
gee , marcia , if i did n't know you better , i 'd think you were suggesting i dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few bucks .
paul , since you brought her up , i have to ask you this , or i 'd be drummed out of the agents ' union -- what about a non-fiction book ? the truth about what went on in that house .
i like it . remember how you once said i live my whole life as if i 'm in danger of being found out ? well , i believe i 've managed to get that guy down on paper . do n't think i 'm completely nuts , but in some way , annie wilkes , that whole experience , helped me .
i 'm delighted the critics are liking it , and i hope the people like it , too . but it 's not why i wrote the book .
i thought you 'd be thrilled . you 're being taken seriously .
great .
and my contacts at time and newsweek tell me they 're both raves . and do n't laugh -- for the first time , i think you 've got a shot at some prizes .
that 'd be a first .
the word i 'm getting is the times review is gon na be a love letter .
here it is . very first copy .
yeah . they 're in the semis .
did they win ?
sorry i 'm late . jenny 's basketball game went into overtime . if anybody ever told me i 'd have a daughter who 'd get a triple double , i 'd ...
marcia , why are you doing this to me ? do n't you know i 'm scared enough ? do n't you think i remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books ? you think i 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness ? i 'm doing this because i have to . now , i 'm leaving for colorado to try to finish this and i want your good thoughts -- because if i can make it work ... i might just have something that i want on my tombstone .
i 'm glad to hear that , paul , i really am . but you have to know -- when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine , they 're not going to say , `` ooh , good , paul sheldon can finally write what we 've always wanted : an esoteric , semi- autobiographical character study .
marcia , you know i started `` misery '' on a lark . do i look like a guy who writes romance novels ? do i sound like danielle steel ? it was a one- time shot and we got lucky . i never meant it to become my life . and if i had n't gotten rid of her now , i 'd have ended up writing her forever . for the first time in fifteen years , i think i 'm really onto something here .
no , no . misery chastain put braces on your daughter 's teeth and is putting her through college , bought you two houses and floor seats to the knick games and what thanks does she get ? you go and kill her .
marcia , please .
not a bad business . this thing would still be growing , too . the first printing order on misery 's child was the most ever -- over a million .
i have n't been a writer since i got into the misery business --
you 're still a writer .
when i wrote my first book , i used to carry it around in this while i was looking for a publisher . that was a good book , marcia . i was a writer then .
it 's ... it 's nice , paul . it 's got ... character .
an old friend . i was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there . like it was waiting for me .
hugh , i 'm impressed..
afraid he 's got no choice . i believe i broke his jaw .
in the envelope in my pocket . my right.. jacket..pocket..
where is it ?
hugh , take care of the nekhorvich memory card .
i thought you were going to dinner .
sean , please..
you 're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance , are you ?
well , you 've thorough about it , at any rate .
one considers her timing , of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down . suggestive , even borderline suspicious , but hardly conclusive .
was n't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..the question is , do you trust her ?
from her point of view or mine ?
not everything . why do you think she 's really here ?
not possible..
- right - - do n't go too far ahead of me now -
all done , chief..
- pull the no2 tank and dump it , it 's potential evidence..
in just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid mary of oz . g'day .
what are you talking about ?
if it 'll make you feel any better , you 're going to take a lot of aussies with you and make me a lot of money .
if it 'll make you feel any better i wo n't do it again .
god damn it , nyah ! why did you do it ? why did you save that bastard ?
not as much as you feel like hearing it .
feel like pleading for your life ?
lovely .
ulrich will be about . he 'll look after you .
oh , no , not at all . maybe just a bit .
yes . we wo n't be able to have dinner tonight . something 's come up . i hope you do n't mind .
a change of plans ?
and you 're going to have time . there 's been a change of plans .
sort it all out .
to do what ?
i do n't know what to do about you , sean . i 'm more than a bit muddled . i need time .
then do n't say it .
sean , there 's something i 've been meaning to talk to you about ... is n't going to be easy for me to say .
well , that 's good , is n't ?
you picked another winner !
what else ?
to win ?
yeah . naturally vain -- but they 're about to close the betting table and i have n't a sou..
see anything you like ?
say no more . i 'm off to grab a drink . still favor bellinis ?
'thief in the night ? '
what made you pick < i > that < /i > nag ? she 'd never won a bloody thing .
i suppose i did .
you won .
maybe that 's it , then . everything 's upside down and backwards ...
wo n't do , love . it 's not spring . it 's nearly autumn..you 're in oz . everything 's upside down and backwards here .
only because..it 's spring..chalk it up - to spring fever .
i said you 're beautiful , nyah .
oh , i am . later..
you 're not interested in seeing how it looks .
and my room ?
mmmm .
your room .
ahh..
magic ...
how do you that .
how i usually find you , nyah .
how hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me ?
on what .
well that depends .
how grateful ?
i left in a bit of a hurry . i 'm terribly grateful , sean .
not much luggage .
sit down . you 'll be a billionaire . better than being broke . i 've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line . ball 's in your court , mr. mccloy .
outrageous . i wo n't let you take control of my company .
in downtown sydney for a start .
where ?
an outbreak of < i > chimera. < /i >
what are you talking about ?
good . biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof .
bellerophen ? no time at all once i 've got it .
in other words , you 're calling her a flake .
oh , hunt , please ! one ca n't hold nyah responsible for her actions..
she would n't be here if it was n't for you , hunt . from this moment you 're responsible for what happens to her , and if you 're looking out for her well-being , i suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me . ball 's in your court , hunt . what 've you got to say ? nyah 's waiting for your answer .
she does n't belong here , sean . let her go .
somebody 's been slipping you our mail . come on out here , you bad girl .
than thirty-seven million pounds ? not really .
why , you going to make me a better offer ?
what was the top bid ?
yep . you 've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer .
there it is , guys , the last of it .
oh . then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the cdc scientists in atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a petri dish , doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective . you knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for .
i knew where it was .
i would 've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint . curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off . you were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 , you never figured out where the virus really was .
you know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you . grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes .
beats fighting the flu , i 'm here to tell you .
and you 're happy about that ?
fight a bit of a cold..
not going in from the ground . show me the atrium .
if you look at hunt 's operational history , he invariably favors misdirection and deception . for a start he wo n't go into biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security .
billy , make sure nyah 's not followed .
nyah !
which means , mr. mccloy , we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options . we 'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options . your stock 's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share . we 'll agree to buy at fifty .
ninety-three point four million .
-- now here 's the way it 's going to work..wallis , the shares outstanding are..
in any case we do n't want your cash .
more like two-two point two million .
not exactly . wallis ?
it 's that time . go .
checkpoint charlie plus 30 , altitude minus two-zero-thousand . airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
unless we dose her with bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes , nyah will kill herself . so , first things , first . swanbeck said there 's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts .
what are you talking about ?
wrong . all we 've got to worry about is ambrose . nyah will take care of nyah .
i 'll be damned . it 's mccloy , the biocyte ceo .
ambrose is meeting some bloke in the bar . big bloke , ginger hair . they 're into something .
oh well , if that 's how you feel about it .
not at all . but how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site ?
well do you disagree with that ?
- or hard wired , right . first line of perimeter defence 'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house . whatever moves burps or bleep is gon na be picked up to a height of twenty feet . basically impenetrable , i 'd say .
..or hard wired..
well you know his blokes 'll place the oscor in his annex , where else if you 're pinpointing transmitters , video signals , covert chip cameras , anything radiating , oscillating..
a myth..just a myth ... should n't you be checking out their countersurveillance ?
what you got there , mate ?
it 's okay . she scrambled the transmission . luther , continue feeding the gps her position .
damn . just when it was about to get interesting .
right . just remember , mates . billy baird 's the name . anything you need to get , move or watch , i 'm your man .
and the check 's in the mall .
that 's it ? that 's it ? that 's it ?
we 're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
there she is . i got visual .
i hope there 's a place to land .
range is two kay .
not for seven more minutes .
we 're due to take off .
right .
before we kill her or cure her..
..in the building ...
exactly where is she ?
billy . i think we got a problem . nyah 's on the wing . up early . billy , do you copy ?
i 'm not ready !
package away in five..four..three.. two..one ...
there guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill ?
so ambrose has bellerophon and mccloy 's got chimera .
what manic invents disease like that in the first place ? why would he do it ?
ambrose obviously got these from nekhorvich on the plane .
then we got'em !
it is , billy .
hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
what can we do ' mate ?
he should 've have killed the virus in the incubation area..nyah 's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab .
how 're we doin ' , then ?
five and a half minutes . he 's breached the hot zone..
how much longer before you can reach him ?
she 's in the elevator heading toward ethan .
i am . she is .
say again . sounds like you 're saying 'she 's in the building . '
he 's heading down the stairs , now..
i 'm booted up . go , ethan .
no ...
no . you just looked as if you did .
no . should i ?
i 'm infected with chimera . you know you do n't have a choice . just do it now .
no .
then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late . before i start killing people .
no .
i guess i lied..you ca n't get both of us out of here , can you ?
- you who do n't have a conscience .
i was n't thinking ! just..trying to keep you from getting hurt , that 's all .
what did you think you were doing !
no time to explain . you 've done well , and we 're so close . so close . it 's critical that you do whatever ambrose asks . do n't worry - it 'll be over soon.. that 's a promise.. come on , now off you go !
what ? you told me to get out of here . i thought you were here to collect me . i was so relieved .
nyah , it 's very important not do anything to alarm ambrose..
ethan , you know what frightens me most when i 'm with him ? ..the thought of never seeing you..how are we getting out of here ?
it 's going to be okay .
i am now . get me out of here . just get me out of here .
are you okay ?
oh ethan ! ..
easy , easy , easy , shhh !
he 's touched your heart . you 're overwhelmed . you need to think it over . you 'll meet him somewhere in a month . if you 're not out in 48 hours i 'm coming in and getting you out . give me the ear piece .
how do you suggest i go about it ?
i want you out of australia ! ..i do n't know how much more plainly i can put it .
ethan , tell me -
nyah , you 've done more than enough . even the best of snake charmers get bit .
why ? what 's happened . what did you see ?
i want < i > you out of there. < /i >
you noticed . what 're you going to do ? spank me ?
i managed .
i 'll muddle through .
betting table twelve off the paddock . nyah , are you up to this ?
where do i meet you ?
affirmative .
-- his left jacket pocket .
bids from possible chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the london times . what 's that about ?
i 've no doubt .
annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house , michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door .
have you met them ?
- michael , his driver 's an aussie , new to me . then there 's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house .
we know him . he 's over your left shoulder , looking right at you as you go on..
just about..
just like old times ?
just like old times .
how 's it going ? everything okay ?
well , forewarned is forearmed . and while we 're at it , be especially sensitive to any sudden change in ambrose 's plans , especially any involving you..
ethan , you take care of yourself , i 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove , i 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice .
you 'll be fine . i 'm going to lose you .
yes ?
he 's got you on qantas flight 2735. it 's going to be delayed .
oh , i do . but as we know i 'm a very poor judge of character .
you do n't trust me .
how can you possibly ? i 've got to get right on the plane . i 'm leaving now .
before you are .
very funny..maybe he has heard and does n't want to know . maybe he 's lost interest .
well , i mean it 's not a total loss . it is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
this does n't seem to be accomplishing much .
look , i ca n't run your arrest in cnn , but i guarantee he 's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world , for what they might be saying about him , if nothing else - he 's got the ability and , we assume , the desire to get you out of there .
probably that i needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind i could n't possible sort out myself..
what would n't make him suspicious ?
sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-i'm- not-nad ' message . not after the way we broke up .
then feel better ! ..
much .
look , would it make you feel better if i did n't want you to do this ?
not me . i was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical .
can you think of a better one ?
and that 's the only reason ?
generally , i do n't favor coercing someone . not when there 's a chance my life could end up in their hands .
someone in possession of all the facts . are you telling me i have to do this ?
i do n't .
no . you can be a thief and have a conscience : not me . why did you have to tell me about this ! what do i have to do to get away from this guy ? when you 're with him , he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now i 'll be at some out-of- the-way-place , a tin of caviar and a bottle of crystal shows up at the table , with two glass , god knows how he finds out at any given moment where i am in the world but he does . and it looks like he 's done it again . you know his definition of a true paranoid ?
you can be a thief and have a conscience .
but i do n't have a conscience . i 'm a bloody thief .
something like that .
you 've either got it or you do n't . let your conscience be your guide ?
so would i. but it 's not mine to give .
i 'd like a little more conviction..
go and insinuate yourself back into sean 's life .
but it is what you 'd like me to do . so tell me to do it..
this was n't what i had in mind , nyah .
not that it matter much but..i seem to recall you staying something like , 'i was hoping we could work together . '
sean ambrose , for one .
that 's lot of people out there..how many of them , i wonder , are capable of something like that ?
and six billion in the world .
there 's nearly 2 million in london .
five , six-hundred thousand .
what 's the population of seville any idea ?
that 's because i 'm on my back .
damn , you 're beautiful .
ask a question , you get an answer ! ..
of what ?
spoken like a spook..you ever afraid ?
so do i. sort of .
well , then , what i am i doing here ? i assume i 'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
i do n't know that they 'pinched ' it . do n't even know that they 're blokes .
you 're not a liar . or you 're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
so where did i got right ?
that they 're lying .
which is ?
that 's not the point . in the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't .
not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .
the only other spook i knew was a liar . charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . he 'd lie about his favorite color . but then i reckon it 's an occupational hazard . all spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies .
they 've got a book for everything .
they 've got a book for this ?
oh . well..this is n't exactly by the book .
when they 've got your recruiting technique ? not a thing .
who wants to be decent ? ..
care to wait a decent interval ?
awfully short notice..
well , ethan hunt , what is it you want to talk to me about ?
ethan hunt .
what 's you name ?
oh bloody hell . you 're a spy .
scotland yard , interpol , every dutch authority . i can make them go away .
your help ? what are you talking about ?
i need your help and i thin you can use mine .
listen to what ?
pull over and listen to me , will you ? just listen..
where did you get this number ? i do n't even have it !
hi . would you mind slowing down ?
hola..
not really . i triggered the alarm..
you 're apologizing for me ? quite the gentleman..
you did n't do that badly .
sounds smashing . i 'm in . muchacho , mi carro , por favor ! now be serious . you could n't possibly want me off tonight 's performance..
working under adverse conditions . highly adverse conditions .
may i say something , no offence ? you look like a gigolo , you sound like a thief , you act like a cop - what the bloody hell do you have in mind ?
wanted to see how good you were . i 'm hoping we might work together .
if you were n't going to let me get away with it , why did you let me go thru with it ?
at least you walked .
i 'm missing something here , aside from a 500,000 pound necklace . even after i botched the job , i could 've walked out of there with the bloody thing .
well , senor de l'arena , there 's no reason to disrupt your party any longer . we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards , which you 'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning , hard copy to follow . shall we ?
indeed .
under the circumstances i think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load . how do you feel about forty kilos , miss hall ?
do what ?
i would n't do that .
- right..
hey , you put me here . i just do what i 'm told .
- this is very disconerting..
- torque wrench .
where 's the bloody -
far right .
- right..where is it ?
oh , either way works for me .
would you mind if i 'm on top ?
i see . you 're not just another pretty face..
think you 're the only one who can pick a lock ?
what are you doing here ?
uh-huh ?
uh-huh .
what if i pay the rent ?
look , it 's either you or the rent and i do n't mind telling you it 's not an easy choice .
there 's not enough time in the world for any of it to be bad .
not tonight . bad timing . sorry -
oh . well . i think that can be arranged .
no . just as if i 'd like to .
no . you just looked as if you did .
no . should i ?
do you know me ?
oh , you do n't have to do that . would n't be a vacation if you did .
not sure . some sort of vacation . i 'll let you know where i 'm going .
well , hunt , what are your plans ?
i do n't . no exactly .
where is she now , by the way ? do you know ?
i do .
in this case , it was n't a bad idea . in face , it was a pretty damn good idea . just do n't make a habit of it . and , as for ms. hall , in light of her efforts , her criminal records will certainly be expunged . i 'm assuming you approve .
no , i do n't . but in this case -
by fire . that 's the best way , really .
but you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the chimera virus . i 'd be very interested to know how , after you 'd managed its recovery intact , it subsequently got destroyed .
well , bellerophon , it turns out , was only really effective against chimera .
and that appears to have been destroyed . it also contained the anti-virus , bellerophon .
yes .
and the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from ambrose .
yes , i gathered as much .
of course it was . anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do , is bound to get a little flak here and there . you try flogging the stories on cnn i 've had to come up with about what 's been going on around here the last few days . at any rate , it 's been most instructive -- what they 'll swallow , or what they 'll broadcast with a straight face . miss hall 's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the chimera virus . not even antibodies .
i 'd thank you -- but i 'm not sure that was a compliment .
why not ? you 've done just about everything else on this operation .
you 'd like me to conduct my own debriefing .
sorry , ethan . i do n't quite know where to begin . any suggestions ?
no . i ca n't afford to be curious . and neither can you , hunt..
are n't you even curious ? about why she did it ?
something else ?
brave girl . if you can get hold of bellerophon with the time limit , you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice . but in either case you 've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her . after that it 's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law . and hunt . however you obtain it , we want you to preserve a sample of chimera . bring it back alive .
she sacrificed herself..
- good . then if you manage to get hold of ambrose , and obtain what he 's got , you 've got - - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of chimera on earth .
yes , i believe that 's right . now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure , the victim becomes infectious . highly infectious .
you mean that leaves miss hall .
but that leaves another seven or eight pints of chimera .
yes , i believe that 's right .
do you ? even assuming you 're able to prevent ambrose selling chimera , you 've now got an additional problem . you destroyed all of chimera at biocyte . if ambrose is going to sell chimera now , he 'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of miss hall 's blood to market .
we think we 've got our finger on the buyer .
we could lock down passport control and all ports of authority , but that wo n't stop ambrose , and beyond him , we do n't know who else we 're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we 're aware are stable . no deposits , no withdrawals . therefore no suspects .
not yet . we did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage .
well it 's not mission < i > difficult , < /i > hunt . it 's mission < i > impossible. < /i > difficult should be a walk in the park for you . if you can think of a quicker way to get to ambrose , you 're welcome to try . oh , by the way , you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job .
very .
you mean it 'll be difficult .
i do n't think i can get her to do it .
go to bed with a man and lie to him ? she 's a woman . she 's got all the training she needs .
she 's got no training for this kind of thing .
well , then i mislead you . or you made the wrong assumption . either way we 're asking her to resume a prior relationship , not do anything she has n't already done .
you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief .
then makes sure she continues to see him . gets him confide in her and report to you .
and then what ?
miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously . she walked away and he 's wanting her back ever since . we believe she 's our surest and quickest way of location him .
excuse me ?
- is where miss hall comes in .
if that 's what you 're thinking ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane . locating him in time to stop something like that -
well you know nekhorvich 's history . you 're the one who got him out of the soviet union was it still in bio- weapon business .
'terrorists ? '
- right . in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts .
in order to do that , i 've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it .
in any case , you 've got to recover chimera and bring it to us .
right now only ambrose knows that .
the question is why ? what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying ?
sean feels he has n't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground .
enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers ?
whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it .
then you do think it was ambrose .
so there 's one thing we know ambrose does n't .
not necessarily .
you know we had reservations about each other . is n't it a little late in the day to be asking me that ?
what did you think of him ?
twice .
when i could n't find you , i had to replace you . sean ambrose was the obvious choice . he double you , what ? two , three times ?
you were there .
if he did n't want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on the flight ?
dr. vladimir nekhorvich is dead . so is his colleague , gradski , but that happened earlier . we had nekhorvich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies..
like it 's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry . and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier . so let 's get on with it . he 's still in sydney ?
like ?
an idea , yeah .
you got ta be kidding .
'you 're sorry and i 'm sorry . '
like what ?
why did you phrase it like that ?
well . you 're sorry and i 'm sorry .
do n't be . would n't be on vacation if you did .
sorry i did n't let you know where i was .
i 'm fine..
..i 'm fine..and you ?
you keep calling me dmitri . you really should n't .
..it seems we have a problem , dmitri .
no . after you 've lived with < i > chimera < /i > for twenty hours , nothing can save you . not even ... < i > bellerophon. < /i >
..not in time to save him .
yes , he knew . just..
he was quite a man . did he know before the end you two had succeeded ?
yes , i 'm sorry too.. 'you 're sorry and i 'm sorry.. ' - you do know gradski thought the world of you .
sorry it could n't be under happier circumstances .
i 'm with an old friend now , dmitri .
they 're ready and waiting . you 'll soon be with old friends .
well , yes . i suppose i am a bit anxious .
you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it , doctor..
good job . and thanks .
so what did he say ?
copy . she 's only got twenty-eight minutes left . track ahead and pick her up .
she 's on the north head bluff - approaching the cliffs . one klick away .
luther , say again .
ninety-seven minutes , twenty-seven seconds .
ethan , i keep telling you there 's not a chance of locating nyah til i access the satellite and there 's not a chance of doing that til i get this thing booted up and running ! how much time does she have left ?
oh . uh . commencing diversion . alarm in cosmetics .
luther , i 'm looking at security .
i 'm not waiting 48 hours . when we 're done at biocyte , if she 's not out of ambrose 's , i 'm going in and getting her out .
thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop .
no garage entrance . lobby 's protected by five guards on rotating patrol .
now how to get in there .
all storage and production of chimera is done here , in this lab on the forty-second floor , the heart of the building .
let 's start from the inside out .
nyah still on the property ?
sorry , that it a biocyte facility , their storage structure..
you 've got the voice print , i 'll get us in..
i kill chimera at biocyte and he 's sitting on a cure without a disease .
yeah . why else would he come back to australia ? if he had them both , he could sell them anywhere .
ambrose got bellerophon from nekhorvich on the plane , but he did n't get the chimera virus .
i told her to get outta there .
she must still be on the property .
i do n't know , but nekhorvich was not a manic . get me a twenty on nyah .
nyah , ambrose is heading back . there 's an enveloped inside --
left jacket pocket confirmed .
confirm . left jacket pocket .
roger that .
left jacket pocket ?
ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope , put it in his inner left jacket pocket ...
yep .
nekhorvich 's boss ?
right . i guess there are n't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer .
luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on bruny island last month , including photos of the victims .
why not ?
that simple , huh ?
nekhorvich specialized in recombining dna molecules . in the myth , bellerophon killed chimera , a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world . i think nekhorvich has created a monster virus in chimera and apparently the means to kill it in bellerophon .
the satellite does n't work as fast as i do .
put in the coordinates and let 's get a visual . the visuals are n't coming up .
it 's the transponder .
you know , i think it 's a little late for that . do give my regards to gradski if you see him .
well , the thought had occurred to me . i needed chimera in order to peddle bellerophon . for hero to be appreciated , you need a monster . now that 's not so difficult to understand , is it ? look , time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo ! not anymore ! ..have you any idea the r & d money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that 's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium ? if i could n't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there , you 'd help me put one out there i can make on ! ..there it is . i 've confessed . i , john c. mccloy , am in business to make money . lilly 's making billions feeding prozac to depressed dogs . pfizer does n't even know where to put the money they 're making on viagra , and let me tell you that shit did n't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose , jesus , who do i have to screw to get a a break ! ..now get me out of here , get me treated and let 's go back to work ! ..
you wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure .
you still do n't get it , do you ? you want to make an omelet , you break a few eggs - < i > i needed to know just how bad the disease was < /i > - in the real world , not the lab . and you never know til you try . you thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas . but i saw you creating a disease so terrible in < i > chimera < /i > that the cure would be priceless .
by asking me .
oh , please ! how was i to know they had to be treated with bellerophon within twenty hours ?
'if ? ' my , my , my ... the five hundred people on bruny island that you deliberately infected with < i > chimera < /i > needed it as well .
you took it ! all of it ! and what if i need it ?
do i ?
you have bellerophon .
you are infected with < i > chimera , < /i > my friend .
it was in the bloody papers , on the telly..what 's this about gradski ?
fatigued , certainly . but dead is a little extreme . on the other hand , when me dear gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live .
what 's happening here ? you 're dead !
a visit from an old friend .
yes , anatoly , yes .
to friends .
dimitri miediev ... dimitri miediev ...
his name is ... ..dimitri miediev .
come on !
you 're right , of course .
you asked for my help . you < u > asked < /u > for < u > my < /u > help ... come on ...
they 'll kill me .
c'mon , c'mon , tell the truth ... c'mon .
i do n't remember what happened ! we were at the bar , drinking , laughing -- having fun .
kasimov , kasimov , good that you called us .
good idea .
maybe we dont have to know what he looks like . if hes got that list , hes going to want to check it . we should be looking for laptops .
this is bullshit - we dont even know what max looks like .
nothing but civilians , gene .
i dont know . it didnt say on the tickets .
what kind of show .
hes putting on a show , barnes .
but why tell us ?
high speed train . no-one gets on . no- one gets off . high security . good place for a pass off to max .
whats hunt doing on the tgv ?
and if we dont find him - well search the whole train again .
only four more cars .
what about him ... ?
you and i know about this -- and that 's where it stops . understand ? it never happened .
okay !
same thing he wanted in prague ! same thing he 's always wanted ! the noc list !
< u > think < /u > , for christ 's sake , you guys are mired in detail , open your minds , it 's got ta be staring us in the face ! what does ethan hunt < u > want < /u > ? !
s.o.p..
that 's s.o.p..
let 's not waste time chasing him . make him come to us . everybodys got pressure points . find out something that 's important to him personally and you squeeze .
so what do you suggest ?
what can we do , barnes ? put a guy at the airport ? how many identities do you think hunt has ? how many times has he slipped past custom , in how many countries ? these guys are trained to be ghosts . < u > we < /u > taught them how to do it , for christ 's sake !
look we can use someone from the embassy and we can get the local authorities involved . close off his transportation .
the man 's gone black , barnes . he 's under until he decides to surface .
yes .
now we dont have to eliminate him ? you like that , dont you claire ? dont you ?
dont jim .
fold it . fold it tight .
all ten million .
satisfied ?
jim - lets just get the money and get out of here .
well claire do you ? have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them ?
why the masquerade ? why take the risk ? well , claire , youve asked the question and you are the answer .
ethan , if you knew about jim ? ..why..
two minutes til krieger shows . thisll have to be quicker than id like . certainly quicker than youd like .
course he did . just exactly when he knew is something of a question . before or after i showed in london , mind telling me , ethan ?
you knew about jim ?
stay out of this . or lachez - moi or t'agueue
krieger .
i do n't think you 're in any position to give orders , do you ? not while i 'm holding this .
may take a little time .
krieger can get it . right ?
if we 're going to virginia , why do n't we drop by fort knox ? i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the god damn cia .
always .
is he serious ?
i always have , claire..
its all right , ethan..youll bring me back ... wont you ...
claire .
this stuff is so sticky .
claire ... hey ...
ethan ?
of course - im sorry to hear you say that claire .
ethans right behind me . listen to me jim . is it such a good idea to kill him ? we take the money . ethan takes the blame . no-one else has seen you alive . no-one will believe him .
you are my eyes . stay with him .
two cars . where are you ?
kittridge is job . max delivered . how far is he from luther ?
ethan ... kittridge is on the train .
yes ... ... .come here ... .viens pres moi ...
is this the only way ?
okay ...
i sent the message to max . were on for tomorrow .
what happened ?
he 's expecting my call . i 'm going to the station ... and i 'm going to call him .
what are you going to do ?
bastard !
kittridge ...
i 'm going to try and get some sleep .
we did what we had to do .
i 'm so sorry . krieger was my call . i 've never worked with him . i 'm sorry , ethan .
what about me - jim called an abort - i did n't comply . i lost the team . i just need you to be safe .
what about you ?
i just need you to be safe .
you did n't have to ... ... ...
i did n't say that .
you do n't think we 're going to make it .
it 's cash . and a second passport . if anything goes wrong when we 're inside , if you sense even the slightest deviation do n't look over your shoulder , you walk away - you hear me ? just walk away .
sure ...
may i come in ?
what kind of help ?
we need help , and we do n't have time . they have to be local .
jim was my husband . i want to know who killed him . i want to get the son of a bitch who did this .
you 're sure about this ?
we 've got seventy-five rounds for your glock 9 , but only twenty for the sig sauer , one pair of visco glasses with monitor , plenty of passports . you said it yourself -- if i 'm not dead , i 'm with you .
i deliver the noc list , max delivers job .
max made a deal with you ?
i 'm going to answer it .
the message is for job .
claire , claire , claire , if you 're not dead , he 's going to assume you 're with me .
ethan , you 're not making sense . let me go in and talk to kittridge . i 'm going to tell him you had nothing to do ...
i 'm going to get it for him . whoever the mole is , i think goes by the name of job , at least part of the time . 1 ca n't find him , but if he knows 1 have the noc list , he 'll find me .
what are you going to do ?
i 've been disavowed . they think i killed jim and everyone else . somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents ' bank account . kittridge assumes i 'm a mole they 've been tracing and i 've been in the employ of an arms dealer , max , for the last two years , to get him our noc list .
why have n't they brought us in yet ?
no one sent me ! we 're supposed to be back here at four o'clock , four o'clock , if we abort , we do n't return here until four o'clock , 0-four hundred , four am , four o'clock -- !
who sent you ? ! who sent you ?
who is they , who is they ?
did they send you ... did they send you ?
who is `` they ? ''
that was four hours ago ! who sent you ? did they send you here ?
i walked away . he said abort . he was gone so i walked away .
where were you ?
take off your god damn coat !
what ?
take off your coat .
they 're dead . jim 's dead .
what happened to jim ?
there was nobody on the bridge .
what happened to jim ?
do n't give me that ! i was on the bridge .
no , i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge .
shut up ! i saw you . you were in the car .
i was n't . i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio . he said someone was ...
you were in the car !
do n't move .
ethan -- ethan , it 's okay . it 's claire . ethan what 's wrong with you ?
roger that .
sarah 's reconsidering . claire , transport in five minutes .
oh yeah ?
if you 're gon na do this again claire , it 's not gon na be on my watch .
are < u > you < /u > all right ethan . what 's wrong with you ?
sleeping 's better .
talking 's good , walking 's better .
i 'm walking .
walk , just walk . start walking .
i want to sleep . can i sleep here .
we got it . on your feet .
did we get it ?
i do n't know , ethan . suppose you tell me ?
if you 're dealing with someone who 's crushed , stabbed , shot and detonated five members of his own imf team , how devastated do you think you 're going to make him by marching ma and uncle donald down to the county courthouse ?
certainly ethan .
can i ask you something , kittridge ?
it 's hunt . what do you need for a pinpoint ? been watching a little t.v. , have you ?
i see you 've been out visiting the folks .
kittridge .
kitteridge , you 've never seen me very upset .
ethan , i can understand you 're very upset .
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole .
since your father 's death , your family 's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now , suddenly , they 're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank . dad 's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all , can be a very expensive proposition ethan . so , why do n't we go quietly out of here onto the plane ...
yes , the mole 's deep inside . and -- like you said . you survived .
this whole operation was a molehunt .
correct the actual list is safe at langley . `` golitsyn '' was a lightning rod , one of ours .
but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy .
that 's right . max , it seems , has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents . this time he 's gotten to someone on the inside - he 's put himself in a position to buy our noc list . an operation he referred to as `` job 314 '' . the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight .
the arms dealer .
for a little over two years now we 've been spotting serious blowback in imf operations . we have a penetration . the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as `` max . ''
you 're right . maybe this 'll save some time .
let 's see if you can follow me around this room . the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock ... the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase - bowtie , 12 o'clock . the other imf team . you 're worried about me . < u > why < /u > ?
i do n't quite follow you .
of imf agents . at the embassy . tonight .
what ?
why was there another team ?
yes . i see your point .
who else is left ?
you seem hell bent on blaming yourself , ethan .
you mean < u > i 've < /u > lost enough agents for one night .
we 've lost enough agents for one night .
yeah . i follow you .
passport , visas - you know the drill . we 'll work the exfiltration thru canada , debrief you at langley . throw the prague police a bone , you know toss them a few suspects . follow me ?
yeah .
i ca n't tell you how sorry i am . i know how much jim in particular meant to you , ethan . personally as well as professionally .
one hour .
no sir .
heard a lot about you , hunt . dont disappoint me .
youre in prague ?
location green . one hour . ill be there myself .
yes .
dont < u > think < /u > , be < u > sure < /u > . are you clean ?
i dont think so .
let 's just bring you in safely , and then we 'll worry about that , okay ? were you followed ?
do you read me ? < u > the list is in the open < /u > !
< u > are you intact < /u > ?
they knew we were coming . golitsyns dead too . the disk is gone .
are you damaged ?
my team . claire , jack , even jim - - hannah , maybe , i -- dont know
whos dead ?
theyre dead .
go ahead .
go secure .
this is kittridge .
well , luther - if it makes you feel any better i 'll always think of you that way .
oh man ... i do n't know . i 'm gon na miss being disreputable .
he was a good guy for a long , long time . just - not long enough . got ta catch my flight.. so . how 's it feel being a solid citizen again ?
you really liked phelps , did n't you ?
just do n't know why i 'd be doing it .
why do n't you come back with me ?
it 's all one big negotiation , is n't it ?
i figured i 'd let 'em reinstate my back pay , give me a promotion , check out my office at langley and < i > then < /i > , maybe , talk about it .
you did n't tell 'em at the debriefing ?
sure . they want me back in so i wo n't break in ! they < i > still < /i > ca n't figure out how we did it .
you 're more than that , luther . they were mistaken about you and they 're trying to show you they know it . they want you back in .
hey , i 'm the flavour of the month !
here 's to you , luther . to being off the disavowed list .
well my mother was a little confused about how the dea could mistake her and uncle donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the florida keys .
the official apology from the justice department , the vip treatment , you know , the whole nine yards .
about what ?
reach your folks ? how they feeling ?
i 'll get you close .
it 's hard to tell . i 'm gon na have to be close .
exactly , that 's your job . tomorrow on the train , you ca n't let this list get out into the open . what 's the range of this thing ?
i 'm not letting this list get out in the open .
because if you knew what you were getting into , you never would have done it .
what makes you trust me ?
now i want you to hold onto it .
krieger < u > did < /u > have the noc list .
luther , relax , it 's worse than you think . the terminal 's in black vault lock-down .
i ca n't just hack my way inside . there 's no modem access to the mainframe , it 's in a stand-alone . i 'd have to be physically at the terminal .
luther , i guess you 're all out of excuses .
and i get to keep the equipment when we 're done .
thinking machine laptops , i 'm talking about the 686 prototypes -- < u > with < /u > the artificial intelligence risk chip --
may take a little time . that 's not what claire tells me about you .
you 're all kidding yourselves . even with top of the line crypto . cray access . stu 3 's --
you do n't know what you 're missing . this is the mt . everest of hacks .
there was never any physical evidence that i had anything to do with that.. that.. with that exceptional piece of work .
this does n't sound like the luther stickell i 've heard of . what 'd they used to call you ? the net ranger ? phineas phreak ? the only man alive who actually hacked nato ghostcom .
profitable .
what kind ?
information .
what are we downloading ?
i wouldnt worry about him . once youve got the money -- hell find you .
what about job ?
the possibility alone is worth ten million . baggage car , rack 3. silver briefcase . combination 314 .
it doesnt , dear girl . as long as you tell me where the money is .
ha , dear boy ! i do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private .
i would n't dream of it .
i 'm going to have to front you personally . do n't lose that money without losing your life .
i 'm not being dropped anywhere without my money .
how will you make sure i 'll have the list in three days ? it 's been a delight . now where can i drop you dear boy ?
how will you make sure job will be there ?
done . bring it to me in london . i want it by the end of the week .
< u > ten < /u > million . ten million in negotiable u.s. treasury certificates , in bearer form , coupons attached . and one more thing -- your personal assurance that job will be at the exchange .
six million dollars . i 'll give you the same . but i want the complete list now , not just eastern europe . i wo n't do this piecemeal , it 's too dangerous . i want the < u > entire < /u > list , the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world .
what was your deal with job ?
i do n't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket . my deal with job was subject to a successful boot scan . obviously it did n't pass muster . deal 's off .
thanks , max . or is it maxine ?
okay , use it . but i suggest pack up first .
very good .
tell you what . how good 's the rf scanner you used in the car ?
mm - hmmm ...
okay , boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you 're gon na have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits .
it 's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i ca n't look at the information and < u > see < /u > if it 's worthless . not a tenable position , sir .
because i can deliver the actual noc list . the one you have is not only worthless , it 's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location .
why should i ?
even so , i 'm sure you could arrange an introduction .
i do n't know job any more than he knows me .
that 's the question i want to ask job .
why , may i ask ?
i 'm noc . was . < u > now < /u > disavowed .
ah , but , we 're asking about you .
like job ?
and how might you know that ? are you another company man ?
the disk job sold you is worthless . it 's bait , part of an internal molehunt .
it 's quite out of the question .
whether you like a paradox . i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
on what ?
that depends .
the penny drops . < u > you < /u > are < u > not < /u > job . yes , job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications . and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful . job is not playful . so you 're something of a paradox .
why not ? you gave job a hundred and twenty five thousand .
really ? and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you ?
i need one hundred thousand dollars .
who are you and what are you doing here ?
let 's move !
wait ! hold it - it 's on . let 's go .
do you < u > want < /u > to blow the fire through the whole building ?
nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did n't go off .
i got ta go in there and shut it down !
uh -- twenty-one , but there 's no alarm in sector twenty-one .
what sector 's the air conditioning ?
what 's the matter , you do n't know this trick ?
that 's not it . that 's not the list .
my contact is extremely shy .
you 're not going to any meeting without me .
we 're not outta here yet .
merci .
time up .
we 'll see .
zero body count .
in langley .
where exactly is it ?
imf mainframe .
bank ?
simple game . four players . exfil opens the pocket -- -- cyber ops lifts the wallet .
stairway , youre wrapped , go to transport .
roger that . opening doors now .
in position . jack open the door , let the package roll .
give me a break , pops .
he 's got it . saved your ass again jack .
i did n't touch it .
jack . jack .
just do n't chew it .
give me the god damn gum .
always .
sorry , am i interrupting ?
just waiting for you , tubs .
is there any particular reason we 're not out of here yet ? !
jack .
claire .
no , were going to recover the disk , understand ? ! now move !
jim gave an abort , we should walk away .
sarah eye on the package . jim , im coming to you .
jim we cant .
ethan . hes out of pocket .
jim . jim . hes in the open .
the package is in the open .
what about my coat ? i 'll freeze .
ok. taking golitsyn 's exit . jack , open the doors .
right , right . good .
higher .
higher . higher .
i 'd say you 've got about two minutes .
forty-four . forty-five .
very well .
i 'm willing to take the chance .
if max does n't like what you have to say , you 'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely .
i do n't communicate very well through a shroud .
allowing max to see you and hear what you 've got to say .
then what am i doing here ?
you misunderstood . no one sees max .
i thought i was going to see max .
you wish to meet max ? this is the price of admission .
why ?
would you remove your hat please ?
ethan - ive always taught you , nothing can be more dangerous than the truth . it can kill you .
jim , its over .
youre wrong about one thing . im not the only one whos seen you alive .
sorry ethan . times up . say goodbye .
dont flatter yourself - six was for < u > eastern europe < /u > . you made a lousy deal - ten for the world ? what is that ? but i needed you for the transfer with max . i got a little extra change ; and you got a little extra too .
arent you going to thank me jim . ten million is better than six .
keep counting claire .
tell me something claire , that night in prague , was it you or jim that blew up the car and scattered hannah all over town ?
but , he didnt know about you . in all fairness , ethan , claire was never convinced her charms would work with you . but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods . `` thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife '' , ethan . oh , ethan is in love with you , claire , make no mistake about it . and like all the worlds lovers , hes tortured by the same , one pathetic question - `` does she feel the same way i do ? ''
i knew about jim .
they stamped it , didnt they ? those damn gideons .
before london . but after you took the bible out of the drake hotel in chicago .
good luck .
and get a doctor .
you got it .
once we leave the safehouse , get in there and crash . ill call you from paris .
i usually am .
youre probably right .
- no . she cant know about me . no one can . not til this is over . theres too much at stake , ethan .
i was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was , standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking im dead and gone . god knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done , i..
jim ... ?
if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max , max has agreed to deliver job to me . ill have claire and luther stickell with me on the train . marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris .
tight security . no guns . real plus .
a meeting tomorrow on the tgv , enroute to paris .
jesus , ethan . good for you .
what he didnt get in prague . the noc list .
whats going to make him do that ?
we dont have to , jim . hell come after us .
..when you think about it , ethan , it was inevitable..no more cold war . no more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself , operations you answer to no one but yourself . then one morning you wake up and find out the president of the united states is running the country - < i > without your permission < /i > . the son-of-a- bitch ! how < i > dare < /i > he ? you realize its over , youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading , youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year . kittridge , well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch , big time !
how did kittridge do it ? ..
yeah .
kitteridge . oh my god ! kittridge is the mole ?
i can sit up straight . i just can't..sit up straight very well . it 's not important ! i saw who shot me . ethan , i saw the mole . it was kittridge . < i > kittridge ! < /i >
jim , who do you think you 're kidding ? a doctor 's got ta look at that . you ca n't sit up straight .
i remember..
hey , i showed 'em to you !
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street .
- so i watched europe . once you showed up in england..it was easy .
yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records -
- but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places..
- and picked us up in the states -
..the next day i managed to drag myself to the safe house , must 've just missed you..anyway , i checked our aliases .
theyre covering this frequency , ethan . cut all radio communications . repeat . cut all radio communications .
about two hundred yards from the bridge .
where are you ?
< u > negative < /u > , golitsyns on the move .
abort . thats an order .
no . abort .
can you lose him ?
ive got a shadow .
we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times .
jack 's pinned down sarah . should be a second . keep dancing .
if you were me , ethan , who would < u > you < /u > trust to make him believable ?
sure . if the main character does .
no , not in a hurry . what do you think ? you think the plot 'll work ?
he wo n't be back in a hurry ?
not this week . this week he 's flyfishing at the oughterard slough in county kildare , with one of our best irish guides .
is n't he chairing the armed services hearing ?
he 's our guy .
you 're going to use walter ?
wonderful . ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel . you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years ? his wife 's got a year old kid . so he says `` all right . who was it ? my friend harry ? '' she says no . `` oh , it was my friend sammy . '' she says it was n't sammy . `` oh , i suppose it was my friend lou . '' `` no , what 's the matter , do n't you think i have any friends of my own ? ! ''
how was chicago ?
because i ca n't afford it . and because you 'd burn up before you 'd burn out .
why not ?
ethan , you < u > ca n't < /u > burn out .
i guess .
ah , god , forget it . what are we talking burnout here ?
what problem ?
when you started noticing your short term memory loss . what < u > the problem was < /u > you and claire had in kiev ?
tell you what ?
i do n't know , i had to go to chicago again . you were in kiev . you tell me .
oh ? what 's the problem ?
what the hell 's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time ? claire 's in a weird mood too .
i thought i 'd take some now .
a hundred and sixty-seven , i think it is . take it all , if you want . < u > after < /u > this one .
yeah , well , jim , fact is i 've got more than ninety days leave coming .
and a lonely ass .
such a nice ass .
i think i might just take that look .
too wicked to have a drink later ?
jack you 're so wicked .
that 's what we do is n't it ?
jack ... that 's spying .
why do n't you take a look ?
i do n't know .
what 's going on ?
loud and clear .
no , in your ... ear piece . you have a lovely smile . can you hear me now ?
of course i can hear you .
look to your right , then back to me . there 's a camera built right into the bridge . whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here . can you hear me ?
phew ! weve got five minutes ...
its working .
run it through from the top .
i always check the batteries .
is something wrong with the phone ? well is something wrong with the batteries ?
its not working .
try it again .
connection denied .
whats the problem .
this wasnt what we discussed .
yes ... its him .
twenty minutes .
how long until we reach the chunnel ?
does n't mean it 's a signal . could just be the hard drive heating up .
thirty-two and change .
that 's not so good for you , my friend .
twenty-six , twenty-seven . so far so good .
i know , i am so sorry for so many things . i love you , moira . i love you . i love you .
then , i suppose the time has come say it 's been nice dwight lionel . it 's been everything . oh , dwight , i 'm frightened .
just across the bay , at the fuel depot . the men wanted to try to get home . i ca n't explain .
the shawfish ?
no , i 'm going .
oh , you 're not going . you 're staying .
i forgot to wave . we 'll have it at the wedding .
i forgot to bring the champagne , mr. johnny .

and i 'll have the special fish .
uh-huh
we will both have the salad ticino .

and go to confession .

his brother .
cosmo , this is ronny , johnny 's brother .
i 'm going to bed now .
you 're welcome .
thank you , rose .
i just want you to know . no matter what you do . you are going to die , just like everybody else .
what ?
cosmo ?
i do n't know , rose . i do n't know where i 've been , and i do n't know where i 'm going . you should have your eyes opened for you , my friend .
where you been ?
why you drinking so much ?
rita . pass the wine .
well , what do you wan na talk about !
i do n't wan na talk about it .
he did n't used to be cheap . he thinks if he holds on to his money , he will never die .
i wo n't pay for nothing .
you 're rich as roosevelt . you 're just cheap , cosmo .
i have no money !
you 're not gon na marry him , cosmo . do you love him , loretta ?
i do n't like him .
again ? johnny cammareri .
nobody . loretta is getting married .
who 's dead ?
no . you were there .
you were altogether asleep . you were dreaming .
i never seen anybody so in love like cosmo back then ! he 'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows . i never told you this cause it 's not really a story . but one time i woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face . like a flashlight . i could n't think a what it was . i looked out the window , and it was the moon ! big as a house ! i never seen the moon so big before or since . i was almost scared , like it was gon na crush the house . and i looked down , and standing there in the street was cosmo , looking up at the windows . this is the funny part . i got mad at you , cosmo ! i thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it . i was half asleep i guess and did n't know no better .
rose , pass the wine .
i do n't wan na talk about it .
johnny cammareri . i think it 's great and about time . what 's she gon na do with the rest of her life she do n't get married ?
i do n't wan na talk about it .
and that 's how much i 'm saying .
you have n't said anything .
i know you do n't . that 's the point . i 'll say no more .
i do n't know what you mean .
you do , huh ? stick around . do n't go on any long trips .
i have my eyes open .
hello , mr. castorini .
hi . hi .

what are you doing here ?
i got it done .
what 'd you do to your hair ?
mona ?
let 's go tell your mother .
so you 'll come to the wedding , right ?
everything is temporary . that do n't excuse nothing .
it 's temporary .
it looks stupid . it 's a pinky ring . it 's a man 's ring .
here .
that do n't sound like johnny . where 's the ring ?
yeah .
he did ?
i did n't have no wedding cake , no reception or nothing . johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at the grand ticino .
maybe .
and maybe that 's why i had the bad luck . maybe if you gave me away , and i got married in a church , in a wedding dress , instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door , maybe then i would n't had the bad luck i had .
i did n't give you away the first time .
you 've got to come . you 've got to give me away .
i wo n't come .
in a month .
more bad luck ! i do n't like his face , loretta . i do n't like his lips . when he smiles i ca n't see his teeth . when will you do it ?
he 's flying to sicily . his mother 's dying .
him ? he 's a big baby . why is n't he here with you telling me ?
johnny cammareri .
no ! bad luck ! your ma and i been married fifty-two years an nobody died . you were married , what , two years , and somebody is dead . do n't get married again , loretta . it do n't work out for you . who 's the man ?
he got hit by a bus .
what killed him ?
the guy died .
you did this once it did n't work out .
yeah .

i 'm getting married .
what 's your news ?
you look tired .
ti amo .

pop , i got news .
i ca n't sleep anymore . it 's too much like death .
you 're not sleepy ?
bed .
where 's ma ?
i 'm wearing your bracelet .
i do n't know . i got a feeling .
why you looking around so much ?
i like your dress . it 's very bright .
you have n't once said you like my dress .
they are little stars and birds . birds fly to the stars , i guess .
oh , cosmo !
i brought you something .
you have such a head for knowing . you know everything .
the man understood me . the woman wanted to be cheap , but the man saw that i was right .

oh yes , oh yes you did ! you 've got those bad eyes like a gypsy ! why did n't i see it yesterday ! bad luck ! is that all i 'm ever gon na have ? why did n't i just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago ? i 'm gon na marry him !
oh no i did n't !
that 's impossible ! it was ruint when i got here ! you ruint my life !
you ruined my life .
what did i do ?
what did you do ?
you do n't get along with anybody !
she did n't like me .
you 're invited to the wedding ! it 's in a few weeks . why did n't you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo ?
all right , i 'm guilty . i confess !
i 'm marrying your brother !
you 're trying to make me feel guilty .
i thought if i stayed away from the city hall , i wo n't have that bad luck i had again .
do n't just become excited .
this time i was trying to do everything right .
take it easy .
what ? what have we done ?
what ?
oh my god .
it makes you look like an angel .
i 've never seen a moon like that .
it 's so bright .
i do n't know . i think it 's the moon .
that light .
what ?
alright . alright . there will be nothing left .
you 're mad at him , take it out on me , take your revenge on me ! take everything , leave nothing for him to marry ! hollow me out so there 's nothing left but the skin over my bones . suck me dry !
what about johnny ?
get all of me . take everything .
i 've got you .
i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you . i want you to swallow me .
loretta .
all my life i have never reached a man . i knew that i would reach my husband , but i took my time and he was dead . ronny .
your blood .
i was dead , too .
i was dead .
me neither .
i ca n't believe what is happening .
oh . oh god . i do n't care about anything . i do n't care about anything ! take me to the bed .
to the bed .
where are you taking me ?
son of a bitch !
a wolf without a foot !
a bride without a head !
i am looking where i should to become a bride !
he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand . he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head !
because i have no luck !
why are you marrying johnny ? he 's a fool !
no !
stop it !
i 'm telling you your life !
what are you doing !
the big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf . this woman was a trap for you . she caught you and you could not get away . so you chewed off your foot ! that was the price you had to pay to be free . johnny had nothing to do with it . you did what you had to do , between you and you , and i know i 'm right , i do n't care what you say . and now you 're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love . that 's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman . you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again !
i 'm a wolf ?
i was raised that a girl gets married young . i did n't get married until i was twenty-eight . i met a man . i loved him . i married him . he wanted to have a baby right away . i said no . then he got hit by a bus . no man . no baby . no nothing ! i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep . i did n't know ... you tell me a story and you think you know what it means , but i see what the true story is , and you ca n't . she did n't leave you ! you ca n't see what you are . i can see everything . you are a wolf !
you do n't know nothing about it .
you really are stupid , you know that .
yes .
you think so ?
she was right to leave me .
you got any whiskey ? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey ?
why you talking to me ?
what ? do you think you 're the only one ever shed a tear ?
i do n't care about luck , you understand me ? it ai n't that .
no . unlucky . i have not been lucky .
stupid yourself .
just johnny .
how many men since then ?
seven years ago .
when your husband get hit by the bus ?
stupid .
no .
so . five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man . no woman since then ?
i do n't know .
why what ?
why ?
yesterday .
when you get engaged ?
instantaneous .
fast .
bus hit him .
how 'd he die ?
he knew my husband who died .
where 'd johnny find you ?
loretta .
this is good . uhh ...
you 'll eat this bloody to feed your blood .
i like it well done .
i know that . i do what i want .
you do n't have to help me .
i 'm making you a steak .
loretta . what 's that smell ?
i do n't care ! i ai n't no freakin monument to justice ! i lost my hand , i lost my bride ! johnny has his hand , johnny has his bride ! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget ?
but that was n't johnny 's fault .
that 's it .
that 's the bad blood between you and johnny ?
it 's wood . it 's fake . five years ago i was engaged to be married . johnny came in here , he ordered bread from me . i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i was n't paying attention . the slicer chewed off my hand . it 's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that i was maimed , she left me for another man .
no , i want you to see this ! i want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day ! chrissy , gim me the big knife !
maybe i should come back another time .
gim me the big knife ! i 'm gon na cut my throat !
i do n't understand .
i have no life . my brother johnny took my life from me .
excuse me .
i have no life .
yes . do you want ...
you are going to marry my brother ?
i 'm going to marry him .
why ?
yes .
have you come from my brother ?
let me come and talk to you .
what 's wrong can never be made right .

why did n't he call himself ?
i 'm calling for your brother johnny . he 's getting married and he wants you to come .
yeah , this is ronny .

i must ask for that back .
and you 're a big liar ! i 've got your ring here !
if i marry you my mother will die .

loretta , i ca n't marry you .
i have no secrets from my family .
i have something to tell you . but i must talk to you alone .
johnny , i have something to tell you .
well . i told my mother that we were to be married . and she got well . right away .
i ca n't . i need my family around me now .
we should talk alone .
i do n't know . but johnny , how did your mother recover ? she was dying .
not yet . i 'm waiting till a moment when she 's peaceful .
have you told her we 're getting married ?
the waitresses were very nice . my mother is slipping away .
how was your plane ride ?
ssh , it 's me . i 'm calling from the deathbed of my mother .
sure .
we have n't spoken in five years . there was some bad blood . i want you to call him and invite him to the wedding . will you do it ?
you have a brother ?
he 's my younger brother .
who is he ?
there 's one thing about this wedding i want you to do . call this number . it 's a business number . ask for ronny . invite him to the wedding .
you 've made me very happy , johnny .
i 'll call you when i get to mama 's house .
i 'll take care of it , johnny . i 'll take care of the whole thing . all you have to do is show up .
yeah .
a month from today ?
alright . a month . in a month .
where ? at the city hall ? no ! i want the whole wedding or we will have bad luck . for a whole wedding to be planned , a date must be set .
must it be so definite ? ca n't we just say that we will be married when i get back ?
how about a month from today ?
then let 's set the date .
a week . two weeks . no more .
how near is she to death ?
my mother is dying . when she is dead , i 'll come back and we 'll be married .
what about the wedding ?
so we 'll pick up the car , we 'll make the plane in plenty of time .
seven-thirty .
what time is it ?
you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement .
i like this ring .
alright .
i helped you buy it . it came with two pairs of pants . it 's for luck , johnny . when you propose marriage to a woman , you should kneel down .
this is a good suit .
yes , on the floor .
on the floor ?
right from the start we did n't do it right . could you kneel down ?
i do n't understand .
we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage .
what do you mean ?
you know i was married and that my husband died . but what you do n't know is i think he and i had bad luck .
yes ?
are you proposing marriage to me ?
bobo , take the cart away .
will you marry me ?
what ?
will you marry me ?
i should n't .
have something .
my scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes .
what 's the matter ?
never is a long time .
you never have dessert .
she was too young for him .
a man who ca n't control his woman is funny .
give him the manicotta , bobo . me , too .
maybe you 're right .
it 's the oily fish tonight . not before the plane ride .
no ?
you do n't want the fish .
oh god , that 's too bad .
yeah , ma , i love him awful .
do you love him , loretta ?
i guess it ai n't modern times in sicily . he came right from the airport . he wanted to talk to you . you got a love bite on your neck . he 's coming back this morning .
a miracle ? this is modern times ! there ai n't supposed to be miracles any more !
it was a miracle .
what ! ! she was dying !
she recovered .

and we 'll sell the house .
johnny has a big apartment . we 'll live there .
what 's thirty-seven ? i had chiro after i was thirty-seven . it ai n't over till it 's over .
i 'm thirty-seven years old .
grandma was still alive . chiro was still home going to school . now he 's married and gone to florida . if you and johnny moved in , had a baby ...
i got married before , you did n't sell .
so we 'll sell the house .
pop do n't like johnny .
why not ?
no .
will you live here ?
pop .
and who 's gon na pay for that ?
oh yeah . he 's a sweet man . i wan na have a big church wedding , ma . and a reception .
good . when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can . but you like him ?
no .
the bank . oh my god , i forgot to make the deposit !
we just come from the bank .
hi . why ai n't you at the store ?
hi , loretta .
you got ta date ?
listen , i got ta go . i 'll take the deposit to the bank but i 'll do the books tomorrow . i got ta go .
oh .
no .
did you see it ?
what about the moon ?
what 's the matter with him ?
hey there ... you with the stars in your eyes ...
hi .
i absolve you in the name of the father , and of the son , and of the holy spirit , amen .
alright .
alright . this is your penance . say two rosaries and ... be careful , loretta . reflect on your life .
i know .
you should think about this .
i know .
that 's a pretty big sin .
i ... a ... slept with my fianc 's brother .
then it was not a sin . but what was that second thing you said , loretta ?
twice i took the name of god in vain , once i slept with the brother of my fianc , and once i bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident .
what sins have you to confess ?
bless me , father , for i have sinned . it 's been two months since my last confession .
did you see the moon last night ?
i will . but i must find the right moment .
talk to him .
cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner .
do n't make yourself sick .
if i hit the stick too hard , the apple will split . if i am too timid , the apple will fall off the stick .
do n't fight .
maybe . i do n't know . he has not asked my advice . if he asks my advice , i do n't know what i will say .
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none .
i do n't know .
he should pay .
my granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding . but he does not want to pay .
do n't fight .
my son does not like this johnny cammareri . he says he is a big baby .
i have heard that johnny cammareri got down on his knees in the grand ticino and proposed to her .
lucy . there are big things going on in my house . my granddaughter loretta , the only daughter of my son cosmo , has engaged herself to be married a second time .
okay , i 'll tell her .
then tell her i 'll come by in the morning . we need to talk .
no idea .
you do n't know where loretta is ?
he does n't like you . thank you for answering my question .
no , that 's really it . thank you for answering my question .
i do n't know .
that 's it ! that 's the reason !
i do n't know . maybe because he fears death .
but why would a man need more than one woman ?
well . there 's the bible story . god took a rib from adam and made eve . maybe men chase women to get the rib back . when god took the rib , he left a hole there , place where there used to be something . and the women have that . maybe a man is n't complete as a man without a woman .
that was my father-in-law , who has a wrong idea in his head . listen , johnny , there 's a question i want to ask you . and i want you to tell me the truth if you can . why do men chase women ?
who was that ?
yes .
that 's incredible .
the breath had almost totally left her body . she was as white as snow . and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house . the mourners . and me . and herself ! she ate a meal that would choke a pig !
you 're kidding ?
my mother 's recovered .
a miracle . well , that 's news .
that 's what i came to tell loretta . there 's been a miracle .
what are you doing here ? you 're supposed to be in palermo .
maybe i should go ?
yes .
it 's late .
out . i do n't know where . i was waiting up for my husband .
where is she ?
so .
she 's not home yet . take off your coat and come in the living room . i 'll make you a drink . i wan na talk to you .
can you wake up loretta ? i need to talk to her .
come on in .
i came right from the airport .
moving in ?
and you are a son who does n't love his mother !
you 're forty-two years old , johnny , and mama is still running your life .
because my mother was dying ! but now she 's not .
it was a miracle !
i 'm sure she did .
of course i want to .
well . yeah . you may not want to .
have you come to make peace with me ?
good .
ronny ! our mother has recovered from death !
johnny ...
loretta ...
it 's nothing !
thanks , comrade .
absolutely !
do n't mind about me . but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her , and bring me a big glass of vodka ?
she did n't hear me . she asked me to repeat , so she could understand what i said . but i would n't repeat it . outta shyness . so i 'm a bachelor .
what happened ?
when i was twenty-seven years old , in jersey city , i asked a woman to marry me . she had red hair . she smelled a jasmine . she wore black shoes with pointy white tips .
i am alone in the world .
do you have a girlfriend ?
sure !
may i presume to ask you a question ?
definitely !
can i get another one of these ?
but absolutely !
could you do away with her dinner , and any evidence of her , and bring me an big glass of vodka ?
yes ?
good night .
i 'm freezing
sure .
good night . can i kiss you on the cheek , too ?
good night .
i 'm too old for me . that 's my predicament .
i 'm too old for you .
we could go to my apartment . you could see how the other half lives .
you 're a little boy and you like to be bad .
i 'm a little cold .
no . i think the house is empty . i ca n't invite you in because i 'm married and because i know who i am . you 're shaking .
people home .
no .
i guess you ca n't invite me in ?
yes .
temperature 's dropping .
yes .
you knew that man ?
sure .
may i walk with you a ways ?
what you do n't know about women is a lot .
i teach these classes i 've taught for a million years . the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago . i started off , i was excited about something and i wanted to share it . now it 's rote , it 's the multiplication table . except sometimes . sometimes i 'm droning along and i look up , and there 's this fresh young beautiful face , and it 's all new to her and i 'm this great guy who 's just brilliant and thinks out loud . and when that happens , when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman 's face , and see me there in her eyes , me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was , then i ask her out on a date . it does n't last . it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months , but then she catches on that i 'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she 's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini . and at that moment , she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face , or some action to that effect .
maybe . listen . you wan na know why i chase women ? i find women charming .
i think it 's because they fear death .
nerves .
why do men chase women ?
go ahead .
i 'm not eating alone . can i ask you a question ?
then why are you eating alone ?
i 'm a housewife .
i 'll remember that . what do you do ?
do n't shit where you eat .
yes .
there 's old saying my mother told me . would you like to hear it ?
sheila ? yes she was . is . was .
that woman was a student of yours ?
i 'm a professor . i teach communications at n.y.u .
what do you do ?
then i 'd be delighted . i hate eating alone , and it 's amazing how often i end up doing just that .
are you sure ?
will you join me for dinner ?
sorry . that was rude .
none of your business .
ouch . too young ! i just got that . you know how to hurt guy . how old are you ?
she was just too young for you .
my lady friend has a personality disorder .
i 'm not disturbed . by you .
i 'm sorry if we disturbed you .
well . that explains it .
he 's a plumber .
i live in a one-bedroom apartment . what exactly does your husband do ?
it 's a house .
my god , it 's a mansion !
yes .
you mean the whole house ?
that 's my house .
we never suspected you !
we did n't know what to think . you were so weird yesterday , and then this morning , we go to the bank and no bag .
i knew she had it .
she 's got it .
oh . right .
what are you talking about , you fool ? her fianc 's in palermo .
you see that moon last night ?
you got me .
i do n't know ! that moon ! that crazy moon cosmo sent over !
raymond , raymond , lower your voice ! what 's got into you ?
so what ? the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you do n't worry about nothing . hey , how about a date tonight , rita . let 's eat pasta and roll around .
shut up . they 'll hear you in the back .
and you were a lamb . as soft as milk .
you were a tiger last night .
i feel great i got no sleep but i feel like orlando furioso !
you know , in this light , and with that expression on your face , you look about twenty-five years old .
i do n't know .
what would he be doing down there ?
cosmo .
is who down there ?
i mean it 's that moon i was talking about at dinner . is he down there ? no .
what are you talking about , raymond ? cosmo ca n't own the moon .
it 's cosmo 's moon .
oh .
look .
what ? what ?
rita . rita .
marriage is happy news .
cosmo . many years ago , when they told me you were marrying my sister , i was happy . when i told rose i was marrying rita , she was happy .
bread ? no , no , no . apples ... . gravy ... very small rocks ...
wait . wait ... tell me , what also floats on water ?
no , no , it floats . throw her in the pond tie weights on her . to the pond .
does wood sink in water ?
ah . yes , of course ... um ... err ...
so how can we tell if she is made of wood ?
i see . yes , of course .
and what do you burn , apart from witches ?
burn them .
tell me ... what do you do with witches ?
there are ? tell up . what are they , wise sir bedevere ?
quiet ! quiet ! there are ways of telling whether she is a witch .
burn her anyway .
did you dress her up like this ?
a witch , a witch , burn her !
bring her forward .
she looks like one . yes , she does .
how do you know she is a witch ?
i 'm not interested .
am i right ?
please !
look ! to maintain velocity , a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second . right ?
well , it does n't matter . go and tell your master that arthur from the court of camelot is here .
it 's not a question of where he grips it , it 's a simple matter of weight - ratios ... a five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut .
what ? a swallow carrying a coconut ?
not at all . they could be carried .
are you suggesting coconuts migrate ?
the swallow may fly south with the sun , or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter , yet these are not strangers to our land .
well , this is a temperate zone .
what do you mean ?
found them ? in mercea . the coconut 's tropical !
through ... we found them .
where did you get the coconuts ?
so ? we have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land , through the kingdom of mercea .
you 've got two empty halves of coconuts and you 're banging them together .
... what ?
you 're using coconuts !
yes !
what ? ridden on a horse ?
i am ... and this my trusty servant , patsy . we have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at camelot.. i must speak with your lord and master .
get away !
it is i , arthur , son of uther pendragon , from the castle of camelot . king of all britons , defeator of the saxons , sovereign of all england !
halt ! who goes there ?
the bridge of death ? ... which leads to the grail ?
seek you the bridge of death ...
but the grail ... where is the grail ! ?
there is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the gorge of eternal peril which no man has ever crossed .
and ... the grail ... the grail is there ?
he knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered .
where does he live ? old man ... where does he live ...
the lady of the lake , her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite , held excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by divine providence ... that i , arthur , was to carry excalibur ... that is why i am your king ! | | old woman | is frank in ? he 'd be able to deal with this one . | dennis look , strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that 's no basis for a system of government . supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses , not from some farcical aquatic ceremony .
well , how did you become king , then ?
you do n't vote for kings .
well , i did n't vote for you .
i am your king !
order , eh -- who does he think he is ?
what ?
we do n't have a lord .
well , who is your lord ?
no one live there .
please , please good people . i am in haste . what knight lives in that castle ?
all of us are ... we are all britons .
who are the britons ?
the britons .
king of the who ?
how d'you do , good lady ... i am arthur , king of the britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle ?
dennis ! there 's some lovely filth down here ... oh ! how d'you do ?
no , no ... not `` is '' !
what , `` is '' ?
you said it again !
how can we not say the word , if you do n't tell us what it is ?
i can not tell you . suffice to say is one of the words the knights of ni ! can not hear !
what word ?
cut down a tree with a herring ? it ca n't be done !
oh , please !
we shall do no such thing ... let us pass !
we are now no longer the knights who say ni !
what is that ?
that is a good shrubbery . i like the laurels particularly - but there is one small problem .
oh , knights of ni , here is your shrubbery . may we go now ?
now - go !
yes ...
and not too expensive .
of course .
one that looks nice .
thanks you , knights who say ni ! you are fair and just . we will return with a shrubbery .
you must return here with a shrubbery or else ... you shall not pass through this wood alive !
all right ! all right ! ... no more , please . we will find you a shrubbery ...
ni ! ni ! ni ... peng ... nee ... wum !
a what ?
we want ... a shrubbery !
all right ! what do you want ?
we shall say ni ! again to you if you do not appease us .
oh !
ni ! ni !
oh !
ni !
knights who say `` ni '' ... we are but simple travellers . we seek the enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
we are the keepers of the sacred words . ni ... peng ... and neee ... wom !
who are they ?
the same !
come , patsy .
all right , we 'll call it a draw .
the black knight always triumphs . have at you !
you 're a looney .
i 'm invincible !
what are you going to do . bleed on me ?
come here .
you 'll what ... ?
i 'll do you for that .
i 'll have your leg .
had enough ... ?
stop that .
what ! just a flesh wound .
look !
course i have .
you stupid bastard . you hav n't got any arms left .
had enough ?
you are indeed brave sir knight , but the fight is mine .
what ?
come on then .
victory is mine . i thank thee o lord that in thy ...
come on you pansy !
you 're a liar .
i 've had worse .
well , what 's that then ?
no , it is n't .
a scratch ? your arm 's off .
't is but a scratch .
now stand aside worthy adversary .
so be it !
i move for no man .
i command you , as king of the britons to stand aside .
then you shall die .
i have no quarrel with you , brave sir knight , but i must cross this bridge .
none shall pass .
what ?
none shall pass .
i 'm french . why do think i have this outrageous accent , you silly king .
well , what are you then ?
of course not ! you are english pigs .
well ... can we come up and have a look ?
oh yes . it 's very nice + + cut to battlements . the taunter turns to some others . + + man + i told him we already got one . + + they all giggle . +
are you sure he 's got one ?
what ?
well , i 'll ask him , but i do n't think he 'll be very keen . he 's already got one , you see ?
please go and tell your master that we have been charged by god with a sacred quest , and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the holy grail .
this is the castle of of my master , guy de loimbard .
i am king arthur and these are the knights of the round table . whose castle is this ?
'allo . whoo is eet ?
hello .
oh , just some friends !
who are they ?
yes , my liege . stand by for attack ! !
we shall attack at once .
it 's the legendary black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ! | | at that moment there is a yell and a scream out of vision . arthur turns . | | arthur | who was that ? | | hector | | it was sir alf . | | arthur | i did n't know we had a sir alf . | | hector | he was feeding it bread . | | arthur | | well , that was a very silly thing to do . now the rest of you stand | well back from the black beast of aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ! | | hector | aaaaarrrrrrggghhh ! | | robin | look out . | | the animation monster starts lumbering towards them . the knights retreat | into the darkness of the cave . | | gawain | | it 's only a cartoon . | | arthur | sh !
what ?
it 's the ... oh ... it 's the ... it 's on the tip of my tongue ...
what ?
what does it say ?
there ! look !
just keep me covered .
what with ?
then we 'd best leave them here and carry on on foot .
they 're nervous , sire .
no . no . no !
ni !
that 's it . ni ! ni !
ni !
| it 's not working . you 're not doing it properly . ni !
ni , ni , ni !
no . ni ! more like this . `` ni '' !
nu !
no ! not the knights who say `` ni '' !
who are you ? tall knight we are the knights who say `` ni '' !
er ... we ... launcelot , galahad , and i ... er ... leap out of the rabbit and ...
who ... who breaks out ?
well now , launcelot , galahad , and i wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the french by surprise , not only by surprise but totally unarmed !
now what happens ?
of course , my liege ...
this new learning amazes me , sir bedevere . explain again how sheep 's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes .
and that , my lord , is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped .
then i dub you ... sir bedevere ... knight of the round table !
bedevere , my liege .
what is your name ?
my liege , i am honored .
good sir knight , will you come with me to camelot , and join our number at the round table ?
my liege ... forgive me ...
i am arthur , king of the britons .
who are you who are so wise in the ways of science ?
who did we lose ?
ha ha ha . ha ha ha .
charge !
it 's always the same ... if i 've said it once .
oh , shut up .
i warned you !
je ... sus christ !
you got us all worked up .
what ?
... you silly sod .
it is the rabbit .
behind the rabbit ?
there .
where ?
there he is !
what ?
too late .
follow !
how shall we find this cave , o tim ?
... make plain the last resting place of the most holy grail .
yes , i can help you with your guest .
look , you 're a busy man ...
a grail ?
a g ... g ... g ...
what ?
quite .
that is our quest . you know much that is hidden o tim .
i do . you seek the holy grail .
you know my name ?
greetings king arthur .
greetings tim the enchanter !
there are some who call me tim ?
by what name are you known ?
i am an enchanter .
what manner of man are you that can conjure up fire without flint or tinder ?
come on , patsy .
oh , did you hear that ! what a give-away .
bloody peasant !
come and see the violence inherent in the system . help , help , i 'm being repressed !
shut up !
ah ! now ... we see the violence inherent in the system .
shut up , will you . shut up !
i mean , if i went around saying i was an emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me , people would put me away !
shut up !
you ca n't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you !
be quiet ! i order you to shut up .
... but a two-thirds majority ...
be quiet !
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs .
yes , i see .
... but all the decision of that officer ...
yes .
i told you , we 're an anarcho-syndicalist commune , we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week .
oh , very nice . king , eh ! i expect you 've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food . and how d'you get that ? by exploiting the workers ! by hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society ! if there 's ever going to be any progress ...
well ... i am king .
what i object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
i 've said i 'm sorry about the old woman , but from the behind you looked ...
you did n't bother to find out , did you ?
i did n't know you were called dennis .
well you could say : `` dennis ''
: well - i ca n't just say : `` hey , man ! '
: i 'm thirty-seven ... i 'm not old .
what ?
i 'm thirty-seven .
man . i 'm sorry . old man , what knight live in that castle over there ?
man !
old woman !
course it 's a good idea .
good idea , o lord !
right . arthur , king of the britons , you 're knights of the round table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
yes , lord .
well , do n't . | i really do n't know where all this got started . it 's like those miserable psalms . they 're so depressing . now knock it of
i 'm averting my eyes , lord .
and do n't apologize . every time i try to talk to someone it 's sorry this and forgive me that and i 'm not worthy and ... what are you doing now ?
sorry ...
and therefore ?
if she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she 's made of wood .
exactly . so ... logically ...
ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone ?
make a bridge out of her .
why do you think she is a witch ?
... um ... yes ... no ... a bit ... yes ... she has got a wart .
and the hat . but she is a witch .
the nose ?
... well , we did do the nose .
well ?
i feel happy ... i feel happy .
you 're not fooling anyone you know . is n't there anything you could do ?
i think i 'll go for a walk .
do me a favour .
i feel fine .
you 're not . you 'll be stone dead in a few minutes .
i 'm getting better !
he will be soon . he 's very ill .
i 'm not dead !
nothing ... there 's your ninepence .
right . off you go .
blue .
what is your favorite colour ?
to find the holy grail .
what is your quest ?
my name is sir launcelot .
what is your name ?
ask me the questions , bridgekeeper . i am not afraid .
who approaches the bridge of death must answer me these questions three ! ere the other side he see .
i do n't know that !
what is the capital of assyria ?
to seek the grail !
what is your quest ?
my name is sir robin of camelot !
what is your name ?
ask me the questions , bridgekeeper . i am not afraid .
stop ! who approacheth the bridge of death must answer me these questions three ! ere the other side he see !
that 's easy !
he has n't got shit all over him .
why ?
i dunno , must be a king .
who 's that then ?
that 's all right . see you on thursday .
thanks very much .
thursday .
when 's your next round ?
i promised i 'd be at the robinson 's . they 've lost nine today .
well , can you hang around a couple of minutes . he wo n't be long .
i ca n't .
i ca n't take him .
do n't be such a baby .
yes he is .
'ere . he says he 's not dead .
ninepence .
here 's one !
bring out your dead !
it just seems silly ... me lying here .
farewell , concorde !
really , i feel fine , sir .
i will send help , brave friend , as soon as i have accomplished this most daring , desperate adventure in this genre .
i think i 'll be all right to come with you , sir .
good concorde ... stay here and rest awhile .
i think i could pull through , sir .
oh , well ... er brave concorde ! you shall not have been fatally wounded in vain !
i 'm not quite dead , sir ...
at last ! a call ! a cry of distress ... concorde ! brave , concorde ... you shall not have died in vain !
and another !
thank you , sir , most kind ...
well taken , concorde !
oh , do n't worry about that ... tell me ... does n't camelot own that stretch of farmland up by the mountains ?
it 's just that when i 'm in this genre , i tend to get over-excited and start to leap around and wave my sword about ... and ...
oh ... that 's awfully nice .
do you want to come and have a drink ?
is it ?
'mm ... very nice castle , camelot ... very good pig country ... .
camelot ? are you from camelot ?
i can explain ... i was in the forest ... riding north from camelot ... when i got this note .
you even kicked the bride in the chest ! it 's going to cost me a fortune !
gosh - is he all right ?
did n't mean to ? you put your sword right through his head !
oh dear , i did n't really mean to ...
i can understand that .
er , well ... the thing is ... i thought your son was a lady .
you killed eight wedding guests in all !
well , i 'm really am most awfully sorry but i ... i can explain everything ...
they cost fifty pounds each !
yes ... i 'm very sorry ...
did you kill all those guards ?
well ... i 'll tell you ...
how ?
i was saved at the last minute .
you fell out of the tall tower you creep !
shut up ! you only killed the bride 's father - that 's all -
hurry , brave sir launcelot !
not you .
i 'm ... your son ...
who are you ?
shut your noise , you , and get that suit on !
but , father .
i know ... but ... i want the girl that i marry to have ... a certain ... special ... something ...
do n't like her ? what 's wrong with her ? she 's beautiful ... she 's rich ... she 's got huge tracts of land ...
but i do n't like her .
herbert ... we built this castle on a bloody swamp , we need all the land we can get .
herbert .
listen , alice ...
i do n't want land .
you 're not going to do a song while i 'm here !
i 'd rather ... just ... sing ...
rather what ?
but i do n't want any of that , i 'd rather ...
listen , lad , i built this kingdom up from nothing . all i had when i started was swamp ... other kings said i was daft to build a castle on a swamp , but i built it all the same ... just to show 'em . it sank into the swamp . so i built a another one ... that sank into the swamp . i built another one ... that fell over and then sank into the swamp ... . so i built another ... and that stayed up . ... and that 's what your gon na get , lad : the most powerful kingdom in this island .
but , father , i do n't really want any of that .
father , lad .
but , mother ...
no ! not the curtains , lad ... all that ... all that you can see , stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that 'll be your kingdom , lad .
what - the curtains ?
one day , lad , all this will be yours ...
oh , i see , right .
no , i want you to stay here and make sure he does n't leave the room until i get back .
we 're coming with you .
where are you going ?
is that clear ?
oh yes , of course ! i thought you meant him ! you know it seemed a bit daft me havin ' to guard him when he 's a guard ...
yes ... make sure ...
the prince ... ?
make sure he does n't leave .
what ?
and make sure he does n't leave .
okay . fine . we 'll remain here until you get back .
right .
just you ...
no , not anyone else - just me .
until you , or anyone else ...
no ... just keep him in here .
oh , yes ! we 'll keep him in here , obviously . but if he had to leave and we were with him .
no ... . keep him in here ... and make sure he does n't ...
oh , i remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us ?
look , it 's simple . just stay here and make sure he does n't leave the room .
if we ... er ...
yes ?
er ... if ... we ... er ...
got it ?
leaving the room ... yes .
leaving the room .
we do n't need to do anything , apart from just stop him entering the room .
... and you 'll come and get him .
no ... you stay in the room and make sure he does n't leave .
no . until i come and get him .
not ... to leave the room ... even if you come and get him .
make sure the prince does n't leave this room until i come and get him .
you must see the doctors immediately . you must lie down .
no , it 's nothing !
we are just not used to handsome knights ... but you are wounded !
i 'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours . we are but eightscore young blondes , all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half , cut off in this castle , with no one to protect us . oooh . it is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear ... .
well ...
sir galahad ! !
well look , i 'm afraid i really ought to be ...
mine is zoot . just zoot but come .
er ... sir galahad ... the chaste .
what is your name , handsome knight ?
well , look er , i ...
the what ? but you are tired and you must rest awhile . midget ! crapper !
er ... + you are the keepers of the holy grail ?
yes . it 's not a very good name , is it ? but we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need !
the castle anthrax ?
ector .
sir gawain .
no , i 'm not .
... i bet you 're gay .
no . it 's unhealthy .
oh , let me go and have a bit of peril ?
no , no , we must find the grail .
look , it 's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as i can .
it 's too perilous .
look , let me go back in there and face the peril ?
you were , sir galahad , you were in terrible peril .
i do n't think i was .
we were in the nick of time . you were in great peril .
no , really , i can cope . i can handle this lot easily !
come sir galahad , quickly !
look - i 'm fine !
we 'll cover your escape !
well , she 's got a point .
you are in great peril .
why ?
quick !
oh ... hello ...
sir galahad !
camelot ...
camelot ...
i 'm sorry , i must go .
back to your bed ! at once !
no , no , this can not be . i am sworn to chastity !
please ... we are doctors .
there 's nothing wrong with ... that .
we must examine you .
no look , really , this is n't nescess ...
they 're doctors ?
well , what seems to be the trouble ?
i am , sir . i am a knight of king arthur .
hurry !
well , let 's not jump to conclusions ...
he 's come to rescue me , father .
i 'm ... er ... sir launcelot , sir .
i knew that someone would come . i knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
well ... yes ... but i had n't realised ...
you 've come to rescue me ?
well ... yes ...
you got my note !
oh , fair one , behold your humble servant , sir launcelot , from the court of camelot . i have come to take you ... away ... i 'm terribly sorry ...
you 've said it ! aaaaarghhh ! ... we 've said it ... wwe 're all saying it .
stop saying it . aaaarghh ! ... i 've said it ...
they 're all saying the word ...
stop saying the word ! the word we can not hear ! the word ...
stop saying the word !
do n't say that word .
oh !
yes ! with a herring ! with a herring ! cut down with a herring !
when you have found the shrubbery , then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring .
a path ! a little path for the late knights of ni !
when you have found the shrubbery , place the shrubbery here , beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher , so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle .
did i tell you ? did you listen to me ? oh no , no , you knew better did n't you ? no , it 's just an ordinary rabbit is n't it . the names you called me . well , do n't say i did n't tell you .
i done it again .
well , it 's got huge ... very sharp ... it can jump a ... look at the bones .
what 's he do ? nibble your bum ?
look . i 'm warning you .
| you turd ! + mangy scots git !
that rabbit 's got a vicious streak . it 's a killer !
you tit . i soiled my armour i was so scared !
when danger reared its ugly head , he bravely turned his tail and fled yes , brave sir robin turned about and gallantly he chickened out bravely taking to his feet he beat a very brave retreat bravest of the brave sir robin petrified of being dead soiled his pants then brave sir robin turned away and fled .
no , no , no .
bravely ran away , away .
i did n't .
brave sir robin ran away .
shut up . oh , nobody really . just passing through .
he is brave sir robin , brave sir robin , who ...
shut up .
brave , sir rob ...
er , that 's ... that 's enough music for a while , lads . it looks as though like there 's dirty work afoot .
she needs me , archie . she canna do without me , she said it to my face . how can i stop now ?
wo n't you give yourself a rest , john ? she 's other people to look out for her .
i 'm not having some prattler going through my things .
it 's what the maids are for .
i ca n't move to tidy .
the place is a mess .
i 'm all right . i just need to rest up a wee bit . the room ... you do n't have to stay .
you should have someone look after you .
what do you take me for ?
be careful who sees it .
it 's a diary .
what 's this ?
get out . out !
she 'll drop you . when she 's done with you , she 'll drop you .
she means it .
aye .
my lips may give a message better of christmas love than e'en this letter . to my best friend , j.b. from his best friend , v.r . best friend !
when are you gon na see it , john ? she does n't give a damn about you .
you know nothing about her !
come on , man , i 'm telling you what you already know .
you watch your tongue .
aye , she may say that to you , but the woman can say what she wants .
oh , i 'm much more than that .
and when was the last time she put herself out for you ? look , john , whatever she says to you now , in the end you 're still a servant .
i ca n't let her down now , archie .
she 'll get over it .
she 'll be worried about me .
do n't be an idiot ! you 're in no fit state to go anywhere .
i 've got my duties to attend to .
you 've got three broken ribs , man !
i 'm getting dressed .
what are you doing ? !
she 'll think it 's her fault for keeping me .
they said you were drunk . why do n't you tell her the truth ?
and she sent no word down ?
i 'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan i 'd be wearing anyway . that 's as much as a page of the back stairs gets and that job 's only for toffs . i 'm her majesty 's highland servant ! indoors and out . there 's no stopping me now .
she 'll blow hot and cold on you , john , she always does . you want to be careful .
but i 'm the only one she trusts .
she 's got an army of people to get her up and out .
the woman 's surrounded by fools ! she has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning . knowing that lot , they 'll still be dressing her at eight .
john , it 's not your problem what she eats .
aye , but will they ?
so ? someone 'll send it on ahead .
one box of biscuits , one box of drop tablets , one box of pralines , sixteen chocolate sponges . it 's the same order every week , but does anybody bother to check it ? now she has to travel all the way to balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys .
you work the system right , you could ask her yourself . just be thankful you 're not working for household . the queen never lets them out of her sight . but wee spats like us can slip through the net , easy .
aye ? then she 's obviously not got enough to do .
the good-looking one .
which one of us is she flirting with ?
there 's love and there 's behaving like you do because there 's nobody to tell you not to .
i 'm not sure i do , archie .
you know what i mean .
what ?
come on , man . there 's love and there 's ...
she loved him .
three years , john . is that not a bit long to be grieving ?
it 's only grief makes her like she is .
she 's hardly a full hamper herself .
if you were looking for promotion , you should have picked one of the healthier ones .
it 's better than shovelling horse shit .
prince leopold ? is he the one who bleeds all day ? so what does his valet do ? wash his poultices for him ?
that 's pretty good for a ghillie .
sixty .
how about yourself ?
not bad , not bad .
seventy a year .
how much ?
i think he nearly ruptured his truss .
so what did ponsonby do when she started shouting ?
not down south you do n't .
i speak as i find , archie .
you do n't tell her majesty how you feel .
i was just telling the woman how i feel , for god 's sake .
so , there are rules . things you do and things you do n't do .
so ?
kitchen and lower house .
checked and locked , sir .
louder , girl !
checked and locked , sir .
you would n't happen to know what the queen 's reading for recreation , would you , mary ?
i hope to go up next year .
have i seen you up in balmoral , mary ?
mary taylor , sir .
what 's your name ?
are you all right , barney ?
yeah .
good . she 's a good girl . are n't you ? yeah , she 's a lovely girl . and you know the queen 's riding tomorrow ?
yeah .
good man . and is she all right ?
yeah , yeah , i did .
yeah , there 's a good girl . have you had a look at this hoof ? she was limping badly . i think there might be a stone in it .
it 's cold out there tonight , barney .
mr brown , sir --
hey , barney .
quite .
i tell you , if we do n't stick together on this , you could find yourself first president 's opposition . du royaum uni .
i 'm flattered you think so .
i do n't imagine you frequent the republican clubs . but the fact that neither you nor i are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence . the tory party has always been our party .
a situation ?
i would talk to her myself , but she wo n't listen to me . she must be persuaded , by someone she respects , to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops .
i see .
i fear the influence he has on her . the man 's word is not to be credited . he is an arriviste of the very lowest water . she 's having a bust cast of him . in nero marquino marble .
of course .
my concern is for the reputation of the monarchy .
i take no account of gossip , your highness .
no doubt you 've heard the rumors .
i do n't think i 've had that pleasure .
have you met mr lyle ? he 's in sugar ... ?
your royal highness . what a pleasure to see you here .
mr disraeli . ma'am .
out of my way !
well , everyone 's entitled to their opinion .
the future king !
whom you address .
do you know who you address , sir ?
i said , are you deaf as well as stupid ?
what did you say ?
are you deaf as well as stupid ?
tell her the prince of wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press .
she 's away to windsor tomorrow . talk to her there .
convey her a message .
she 's busy .
i wish to see my mother .
i beg your pardon ? mama ... ?
it 's the queen 's decision .
well , i 'm sorry , but i really do think it 's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant .
and that is my last word on the matter .
mama ...
brown 's responsibilities are onerous enough already . he has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed . the smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock .
but mama , the room was built expressly for that purpose . it has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
it is quite late enough .
yes , but is n't midnight a little excessive ?
it is a disgusting habit , bertie . it should be discouraged .
surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop ...
i do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me . doctor jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box !
if it is inconvenient to her majesty , then perhaps she might consider allowing the prince of wales to host --
... least of all my son . it was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave .
mother ... .
cold is good -- is that not so , dr . jenner ? !
it 's so infernally cold in here .
no dinners , bertie . why are you dressed for outdoors ?
i thought , a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps ?
gesture ?
back and upper corridors .
checked and locked , sir .
you 'll talk when i 'm finished !
we --
what happens to john brown is his business , but the queen 's security will never be compromised !
that 's a tautology lad . if you say the queen arranges something , you 've no need to say she 's done it personally . that 's understood .
the order of seating at the upper servant 's table is arranged personally by the queen herself .
my own .
by whose authority ?
not now he does n't . this is my place .
mr. carter , the head butler , sits there .
i recommend her majesty uses the covered carriage with a full horse guard . in the event of any disturbance i will ensure --
the queen will be riding to st. george 's on the fifth .
we are all of us subject to forces beyond our control , mr brown , even you .
nobody has any rights over me .
in as much as the article is about yourself , i think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you .
this is a slur on her good name .
i do n't doubt that the queen was highly amused . she has always had a very healthy sense of humor .
do n't think i ca n't persuade her .
i believe that decision rests with her majesty .
if i find out that you had anything to do with this , i will have you sacked .
it can wait . anything else ?
there are important papers from --
that can wait till the weekend .
she 'll need to sign dispatches before she retires .
she 'll be away on friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the grants in glasalt . if she 's to make the journey there and back in the day she 's to have no distractions the night before . she 'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early .
yes , it most certainly is !
is that the queen 's request ?
go inside at once .
well , you tell her majesty from me , if her husband was here now , he 'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her . what the hell 's the point in me being here otherwise ? !
i thought i made myself perfectly clear . you do not leave your room until her majesty requests it .
i beg your pardon ?
no .
you will await your orders like everyone else . unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday 's little excitement .
i did n't come all this way to sit on my arse .
you do not report for duty unless the queen requests it . you know that very well .
awaiting my orders .
yes . i do .
do you ?
in matters concerning the household , i act on her behalf .
i came down at the queen 's request . i 'll take my orders from her .
there is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the equerries . no plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household .
aye , do .
then we 'll have to see what can be arranged .
that 's not good enough .
i 'm sure it wo n't be difficult to find you .
i need a man who knows where i am .
her highness ' equerry .
who 'll bring it to me ?
you 'll be sent a message .
how will i know what she requires ?
i 'm sorry ?
how will i know ?
her majesty 's routine at osborne house is not as you will remember it . the household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever . as for the queen 's routine , she breakfasts at nine thirty , lunches at two , takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five . no one is allowed to leave the building while the queen is at home . on the rare occasions when she is out , you may ask permission to leave , but only with my consent . you 're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock . you 'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires .
but others will know that you acted for the greater good .
she 'll think i betrayed her .
in time , she will .
she 'll never understand it .
for once in my life , i am not the issue .
i promised to protect her from people like you .
no love .
no loyalty .
the greasy pole .
too busy looking after themselves .
they are n't as watchful as you .
the threat . i tell them , but they do n't see it .
see what ?
they do n't see it .
she trusts you , john .
her mind is set . she wo n't change now .
the truth is , the queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public . john bull loves her and john bull is her best defense .
so ... ?
ah , but therein lies the paradox . it is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents . the longer she is away , the stronger they become ; and who , honestly , can promise security against that ? however many doors you lock , someone will always get in . even here .
why do you think i keep her here ?
you will not be unaware of the threat now posed by republicanism .
no other aspiration ?
i said . i serve the queen .
but yourself ? what about john brown ?
aye .
for her majesty .
i do what i do .
to have achieved one 's ambition , or to have reconciled oneself to its limits , is a lifetime 's work .
why ?
then i envy yo .
maybe , once .
was there never ambition ?
what i do , i do for my queen .
surely --
i would n't know .
the look on their faces when one walks into the room . still gives one a ridiculous thrill .
this is the top .
oh .
i 'm not married .
still , someone must attend you . your wife should not have let you out .
it 's nothing .
you 're injured .
i 'm fine .
forgive me , i 've called you out and you should have been resting .
i do n't think about it .
princes and lords are but the breath of kings , an honest man 's the noblest work of god . you must miss such magnificent views .
i 've been called back to london . my last day . i thought i might take a walk on lochnagar .
you sent for me .
quite .
always remember , you keep it tight to your shoulder , you absorb the kick . aim for the head . then imagine it 's gladstone .
if you hunt , you kill .
to shoot perhaps , but not to kill .
dare say you can be taught .
occasionally .
do you hunt ?
i am a blank sheet .
what do you know about the highlands ?
a man can refuse only so many invitations from his queen . it was remiss of me not to come earlier .
what brings you here ?
yes . yes it was .
someone has to look after you . it could 've been someone . it was before .
you should never have gone out in such foul weather .
because i have to !
then why send me back to them ? !
-- when i took you out riding , come rain or shine , because i knew it was right for you , when i kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace , when i saw you safe from home to home and you did n't even know i was there ... ! all i 've ever thought about is you !
i will not hear any more about my safety ! ! you made me a promise and now you have broken it !
for god 's sake , woman , i 'm just trying to keep you safe !
you are forcing me to do the very thing you know i fear most !
i 'm breaking no promises !
-- you stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me !
have i ever let you down before -- ?
i can not believe you are saying this ? you , who i have relied on all this time --
if duty and safety are served by the same end then , aye , i do .
duty ? ! you talk about duty ? !
the queen forbids it . i can not allow it because i can not live without you . without you , i can not find the strength to be who i must be . please .
i had foreseen that you would not . but your majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this . i leave for deeside --
i do not accept .
having considered my position here at court , i have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of your majesty that i should resign .
yes ?
ma'am ?
yes , ma'am .
has someone seen to those bruises ?
yes , ma'am .
i was told you were in a fight .
yes , ma'am ?
john ?
i 'll decide when it 's exaggerated .
the threat from the irish is greatly exaggerated , i 'm sure .
aye . but there are fenians reported on the mainland .
am i not safe enough with you , john ?
dear me , you 'll be telling me to watch what i eat next .
i ordered it . it 's for your own safety .
must they always follow us ?
i heard something .
what is it , john ? john ?
aye .
to keep out the cold .
we took a nip of whiskey .
ah , well ...
i hope they did n't go to any trouble , john .
they 're ready now .
what mr ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit , a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming . literary appreciation does not begin and end with tennyson .
aye , well , if all you want is a good opinion then he 'd be sure to oblige you .
of course i shall say what i have to say . i always do .
just say what you have to say , woman . what other people think should n't matter to you .
i do not do it for others . but ponsonby thinks they are good .
i do n't groom a horse to have it admired by others , i groom it because it needs grooming .
his remarks were directed at the quality of the writing , not its subject .
that does n't make him an expert .
he has been attending at balmoral for many years .
what does he know about the highlands ?
sir henry ponsonby tells me they are charming .
who by ?
i am told so .
are they worth reading ?
i am thinking of publishing my `` highland journals . ''
craobhan-geanmchno ... how can i possibly say that with a straight face ? !
craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich .
those , over there , there .
what ?
what are those ?
yes .
aye , ma'am .
it is a fine spot for a bench , is it not ?
sir henry is not alone . they all wish it . the same people who refused to grant my husband the title of king because he was deemed of insufficient rank --
if prince albert were here today , he 'd tell him a thing or two .
he thought so , yes .
it 's a fine spot , ma'am .
prince albert was going to build a bench here . he thought it one of the best views in osborne .
and i intend to be there when she 's ready .
the queen will ride out if and when she chooses .
because i think her majesty is wrong . if ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air , it is her .
then why do you persist in doing it ?
yes , ma'am .
you have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so .
yes , ma'am .
mr brown .
yes , ma'am .
yes . that will be company for you .
archie .
yes . you have a brother in service here , do you not ? i forget his name .
i 've no family , ma'am , apart from my brothers and sisters .
my husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you . he would have approved , i am sure , of my calling on you in this way . i trust it does not inconvenience you too much .
i 'm glad of it .
your family sent cards . it was much appreciated .
she 's well , too .
and the pony ?
i am .
you are well ?
aye , ma'am .
you are here safely .
ma'am .
mr brown .
oh , several things .
what can we do ?
i beg your pardon ?
you 've seen the latest cartoon in punch , i take it ?
i came as quickly as i could .
not at all , dean . good of you to spare the time .
forgive me , gentlemen . i 'm late .
i have asked him to show you a little of highland life while you are with us at balmoral .
yes .
this is my good john brown .
no , ma'am .
i stay here because i am happy . is that such a terrible crime ?
forgive me , ma'am , i can not speak for the nation , only for myself . as prime minister i confess i miss your presence , but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and i should not burden you with it .
i never thought to be bullied by you , mr disraeli . you , i thought , understood a widow 's grief .
in so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave . a figurehead .
is that not enough ?
indeed , and for that they are eternally grateful .
then they may read about me .
but i lack your prose , mr disraeli .
your majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance . as for your people , look no further than the sales of your highland journals to see in what affection the nation holds their queen . you sell even more copies than mr dickens .
i was trying to imagine `` rather upset . ''
the princess louisa is too ill to move . frankly , the queen 's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity . you 're smiling .
what 's her excuse this time ?
she 's refusing to leave balmoral .
in the press , perhaps . but she 's sold more copies of her highland journal in three months than punch will ever sell in a year . time to wheel her out .
it 's questionable whether there 's any advantage to be had from that direction . she 's never been less popular .
mrs brown .
who ?
gladstone 's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years . we need help . where is the old girl ?
you ca n't know that for sure .
we 're going to lose .
to know when he 'll be king .
what did he want ?
i hope he got his mother 's permission .
i see the prince of wales is here .
we 'll see which way the wind blows .
so ?
gossip counts . lord aberdeen was right . this country is not governed by wisdom but by talk . granted , it would n't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning , but if public opinion is against her , then it does n't do to appear too close .
my dear stanley , a prime minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion .
surely , you 're not suggesting we dispense --
the question is , do we need her ?
well , both .
the cartoon or her majesty 's absenteeism ?
should we take it seriously ?
no , indeed .
well , no rest for the wicked , henry .
some young page was boasting about having seen it . lucky .
where did you find it by the way ?
of course .
quite . i think i 'd best take it back .
yes .
we think she can be dissuaded . have you had a glance at the diary ?
dear oh dear .
the queen wishes to publish an account of him .
a few days ... when he heard , the prince of wales threw the bust from the window of the royal gallery . it took four hours to gather the fragments .
not too protracted , i hope .
erysipelas .
no , she was n't .
a distinct flushing around the cheeks . she was drunk , i tell you .
excellent !
a fine choice , sir .
how ill is he ?
i did not consider it wise , in the circumstances , to tax your nerves .
why was i not informed ?
the same , your majesty .
no . you are mistaken . prince albert , my husband , had typhoid fever . i asked what was wrong with my son .
i will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy ... .
forgive me , your majesty . in no way did i wish to suggest --
why am i being lectured in this way ? !
excellent , ma'am , excellent . but perhaps if her majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity ...
cold is good !
i 'm sorry , ma'am ?
whom ?
we 're expecting brown this afternoon , ma'am .
why was i not told earlier ?
a few days , ma'am .
how long has he been this sick ?
i believe not , ma'am . i understand -- he 'd had rather too much to drink .
has he been hurt ?
i understand he was in a fight .
unwell ?
i believe he is unwell , ma'am .
why ?
mr brown is unable to attend today .
well ?
i do n't know , ma'am . he was observed earlier , i believe .
i made no request to go out riding today . how long has he been there ?
he appears to be ... standing by his horse .
what is he doing there ?
it 's mr brown , ma'am .
yes , ma'am .
just them ?
the royal family and senior members of the household , ma'am .
ma'am .
please tell the princess , and other signatories to this letter , that the queen will not be dictated to , or made to alter , in any way , what she has found to answer for her comfort . do i make myself clear ?
ma'am ?
they are demanding the dismissal of john brown on grounds of drunkeness .
what do they want ?
my family is quite capable of communicating with the queen in person .
from princess helena and other members of your family .
from whom ?
i have a letter , ma'am .
what is it ?
there is one other matter .
is it not enough that she is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors ? ! i am not a fool . i know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends . sometimes -- i feel that brown is all i have left of albert . and now they attack brown too .
your majesty --
no-one should think themselves wiser than me ! it is not for any of the queen 's subjects to presume to tell her majesty when and where she should come out of mourning . it is the queen 's sorrow that keeps her secluded ! it is her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility , work which she feels will soon wear her out entirely !
i -- forgive me , ma'am , i am no wiser than yourself .
why not ?
i have no idea .
who told them that ?
read it !
again ?
read it .
and now i am back .
we were expecting you to return by six .
we stayed a little longer than expected with mr and mrs grant . it was most agreeable .
no . i shall be out walking .
he thought , perhaps , your majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government .
why ?
lord clarendon arrives , by invitation , at eleven o'clock , followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate princess alice 's birthday . dispatches , as usual , at two . the chancellor writes to say that , by happy coincidence , he will be in cowes for the weekend . he asks if your majesty might grant him an audience .
of course , at once .
please make sure it does not happen again .
i 'm very sorry , ma'am . i ca n't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions .
sir henry , mr brown is standing in the courtyard . i have no wish to go riding .
he has typhoid fever , ma'am .
what is the matter with him ?
you ordered all members of the royal family to attend you at balmoral .
then why are you not with him ?
he is sick , ma'am .
why is he not here ?
prince albert is at windsor , ma'am .
where is my son ?
yes , ma'am .
that 's a very pretty shawl you are wearing , alex . silk suits you well . but you are not eating enough . one must not let vanity overrule one 's appetite .
sure .
thanks , albert . think you could print up those schematics ?
well , technically `` yes '' , but this is only the prototype .
could you play arcade with that ?
well , we 're veering into classified info here , but i 'll tell you that it involved a donor . he was dead of course , so it 's not like anything unethical was happening .
how the hell did you do that ?
well ... it involves a paradox . you have to trick the boatman . now all the while , you also have to watch your strength . you can build that back up by catching fireflies ... the little glowing guys ...
just tell me the fucking riddle .
if i tell you , then it 's no fun .
what 's the riddle ?
you ca n't . he gets you and you 're dead . it 's like time catching up with you , you know ? like fate . each level you get progressively less time to complete . first half of the game takes place in the wild lands . then you reach level 6 , and that 's the sea of darkness . there 's a two-headed boatman that 'll take you across if you answer his riddle right . if you do n't ...
how do you stop the screamer ?
you 've got your ten levels , right ? here they are ... each level has an exit , only remember , the exits are n't always what they seem . first one 's the blood red sky , then you 've got the blue desert , tower of ghosts , kingdom of the blind ... on each world you have to find a golden key and you 've only got so much time to do it in . if you 're too late , the screamer comes .
it 's a tough game . hard to pin that bastard down . keeps on changing the rules .
what do you mean ?
getting there . it 's more sensitive than a joy-stick . your video-character can respond as fast as you can . but what can i do for you ?
does that thing work ?
and maybe you 've been taking too many drugs .
the donor . maybe he 's alive inside the game .
he ?
maybe he 's not dead .
well , brain-dead anyway . coma patient . it 's really not all that important .
dead ?
it 's the game 's logic core . we actually patterned it after human brainwaves . i mean , there 's a personality in there . that 's what makes it so incredible .
but how can it change every time ?
good question . see , that 's where the fun comes in . arcade changes it every time . he 's a machine without a soul . once you give him a soul , he stops being a threat .
how do you do that ?
level ten . that 's where you 've got to unlock arcade 's heart using the keys you 've found .
what 's the question mark ?
the next half of the game takes place in arcade 's brain , the city of truth . it 's urban scenarios , lots of metal and concrete . screamer comes faster here . on level four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world . got ta time it right though .
sure . every game 's got 'em . i 'll start with the schematics . i can print these up if you want .
we vere thinking there might be tricks . you know , surprises that you 'd worked into the game ...
yeah , who is n't .
we 're having some problems with arcade ...
there 's something wrong with arcade . the game 's alive somehow ...
talk to me .
why do n't we take this into my office .
neither are we . something 's wrong with the game , mr. difford .
if this is a joke , i 'm not laughing .
you do n't like it ?
it 's the game , arcade .
now what seems to be the problem ?
security camera . pulled your files before i came down . be careful what you say , kids ... i know where you live .
how 'd you know it was us ?
nick , alex , how are we today ?
but you always lie , so you did n't come from there . that means the city on the left must be the city of truth .
i came from the city on the left .
liar . did you come from the city on the left , or the city on the right ?
actually , no . i was just telling nick , here , that my t.v . 's busted ...
did you play arcade last night ?
what 's her problem ?
everybody 's sick , huh ? it 's fifteen after . we always meet here , you know that .
sick ?
he 's probably outside . you know how he is . gets bored ...
has anyone seen greg ?
what the hell does that mean ?
he thinks i 'm `` sublimating '' .
i just thought of something . if we came back from the game ... ... what if arcade did too ?
what is it ?
never been on a snowboard .
we can take the dunes down like a ski slope . pretend you 're on a snowboard .
there never is .
christ ... no time ...
i do n't want to talk about it .
one of them , anyway ... did you see it ? the screamer ?
so that 's what we almost died for ?
we do n't have a choice !
we ca n't reach that !
screamer .
what the fuck is that ? !
look around ...
what ? ! there 's nothing here !
our time 's up .
check your read-out .
shit ...
there ...
hey , my strength 's low . look out for fireflies .
yeah , that 's what worries me .
and we 've still got time left . this was a piece of cake .
right , then ...
the clock 's already ticking .
the keys are supposed to be at the end of each level . once we get all the keys , we can unlock arcade 's heart . and then ...
okay . it 's west .
you 've got the schematics , check .
which way do you think level two is ?
got it .
i 'll take the lead and handle the physical threats . you watch the elapsed time and look for exits .
that 's what i was hoping you 'd say .
yeah , well i figure these are unusual circumstances .
thanks . always wanted to do that .
do n't even say it .
one . in case ...
okay . give us a kiss ?
we 're actually inside , are n't we ?
you feel it ? it 's different this time .
i know . it sucks .
i already have a boyfriend , nick .
i do n't want anything to happen to you . i care about you .
what ?
you do n't get it , do you ?
no . if you 're smart , you run like hell .
and what if something happens to you ? am i suppose to go in after you alone ? !
i know how to do this ! i 'm good at these games . you never play , you 'd be nailed in an instant .
yes i am ...
you 're not coming , alex .
yes it does . do n't you see ? we have to play by the rules . that 's what it wants .
it can turn itself on , alex ! it does n't need a quarter .
put in a quarter .
i do n't understand . it wants us to play the game . it 's been taunting us ...
a way to hook this helmet into the game . i 'm sure there are interfaces ...
what are you looking for ?
you did n't hear me ?
alex ...
yeah . the inferno .
dante 's inferno .
i 've been thinking about that . arcade 's like a virus , so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started . you know , like his point of origin ?
everything .
you got the schematics ?
i ca n't believe you made it !
jesus christ !
get that helmet . if we 're going to play arcade , i want every advantage possible .
what are you going to do ?
go outside , get your car , and meet me out front with the engine running . and make it quick , okay ?
we 're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer , learn some tricks and stuff ... i mean , you do n't want us kids running around school saying your game 's too hard , right ?
no i 'm not ...
what alex is trying to say is that it `` seems '' like it 's alive .
drives 'em crazy every time .
virgin sacrifices ?
i was afraid you 'd say that .
you realize that in order to do that , we 'd actually have to play the game .
and beat it at it 's own game .
you mean we learn the rules ...
they made arcade . it 's still a game , right ? it thinks like a game . maybe it still has to play by the rules . someone had to program it in the first place , did n't they ? .
what ?
slip-stream .
i do n't know .
then where do we go ? !
give me a break , alex . what are we going to tell them ? excuse me , officer , but there 's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines . i 'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers ...
the police , then ...
it 's already out .
anywhere . we have to stop it from getting out .
right . and then communication satellites , and then anywhere .
... but then it hits the relay stations ...
it 's growing . getting stronger . maybe it 's only localized now ...
like the fractals ?
maybe it is alive in a way ... some sort of electronic intelligence . it 's like a computer virus that developed a personality or something . it 's self-replicating ... it mimics life .
nick , what is it .
it 's not just the cable system . it 's in the phone system as well , the electronic net . it 's everywhere .
what ?
that 's what i thought .
my house . i want to try something .
where do we go ?
we 'll call 911. look around alex . we broke in , smashed the t.v. , no one 's going to believe what happened here !
we ca n't ...
then leave her .
what ? !
change the channel !
let 's go around back .
it does n't necessarily mean she 's ...
this is like a movie or something . i mean , am i paranoid or what ?
laurie 's .
where to now ?
she thought benz was at school .
well ?
okay . we 'll see what 's up . but if things are cool , i do n't want to hear anything more about this . life 's too short , know what i mean ?
if they 're sick , great . but let 's make sure . come on , nick .
no way .
we have to find out what 's happened to them . i think they 're gone ...
sure .
it 's not this weird . it 'll make sense . everything gets weird this late anyway , right ?
it 's two o'clock in the morning . go home . go to sleep . we 'll figure something out in the morning .
because i did n't know where else to go .
all of them ?
it 's the middle of the night . they 're asleep . phone did n't wake them .
something 's happened to them .
call the others . laurie , benz ...
sorry . maybe i need the valium .
no it did n't . it 's just a faulty relay or something . it happens .
it turned itself back on , nick .
quiet . i do have parents , you know .
see , men always do this . `` quiet down , honey . chill out . take a valium '' . i 'm not a fucking idiot , nick ! i did not imagine it ! ! !
you imagined it .
so how did it know my name , then ?
how ? ! it 's a machine , alex . machine 's do n't think . they 're not alive . it 's a good program , a brilliant program , it was designed so it would act as if it were alive , but it 's not alive .
it is .
alex , i think you 're freaking out . greg 's gone , i 'll give you that . and maybe he 's in trouble . but it 's not arcade that 's doing it ...
no , wait . just listen . i hooked it up earlier tonight , and it said my name . as soon as i turned it on , nick . it said my name . how could it know ? and then , i asked it where greg was , and it said , `` in here '' .
no . look , i know you 're not going to believe me , but listen anyway ... i think the game 's alive somehow .
happy ?
turn if off !
i 'm in the middle of it ...
can you turn off the game ?
greg never came home . a few hours is one thing , nick , but this is different . something 's happened to him .
what do you mean by `` weird '' ?
funny .
alex , you do n't know how long i 've waited for this .
i 'm coming over .
it 's twelve-thirty !
no , in person . now .
we are talking ...
i have to talk to you .
what the hell are you talking about ?
listen to me ! greg never came home . i think the game has something to do with it .
have you played the game yet ? it 's incredible ! i was just ...
nick ...
hey , kid .
hello ?
but he was playing the game . i mean , you saw him ...
so take his car home . wait . i 'm sure he 's up to something ...
yeah ...
hmmm . he said you were going to have dinner ?
guess he took off ... you have his keys , right ?
so where is he ?
well , it 's a long story ...
so how did you do it , alex ?
hold my keys , then .
go for it .
sure . never come back . disappear forever .
and then keep on driving ?
come on . we 'll hit dante 's after school , try the game out , maybe get some dinner .
good . cause i 'd freak if you were n't .
i 'm okay .
so tell me you 're okay , then .
i know .
listen to me , alex . these counselor 's do n't know anything . they 're full of shit . if you do n't fit the pattern of the perfect kid , they freak .
oh god ... oh god ...
it 's here ! ! !
in this world , wrong is right !
it 's the wrong way !
that way .
which way ?
then we 'll go home .
then we 'll go home ?
thought so .
yes ...
how did you get here ? did you play the game ? !
you have no time .
i 'm thinking !
you have no time . what is your question ?
think ! i want to go to the city of truth , and the truth teller is from there ... but which one is which ? the liar ... think !
wait ! no ! that 's not it !
is that your question ?
what did he do to you ?
not yet , honey ...
is ... is that where we are ? did i die ?
yes ... but ... how did you ...
i love you , alex . i never wanted to leave . you know that , do n't you ?
i miss you so much , alex . i want so much to be with you ...
but i do n't understand ...
of course i am .
mom ? you 're alive ...
the air-force is working on the same thing .
this is one of our newest projects . we 're trying to get rid of joy-sticks altogether ...
sign me up .
so what do you think ?
the game will guide you .
so how do i start ?
it changes . there are eleven levels . each one is a different layer of the arcade universe . the concept is , you 're entering the video game itself , making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade 's brain .
so what 's the scenario ? am i saving a princess ? fighting zombies ?
in case things get too intense . it automatically freezes the game , gives you a breather . things can get pretty wild ...
`` escape '' ?
is it ? why do n't you see for your self ?
that 's impossible .
a man after my own heart . straight to the point . what 's different about arcade is the way it reacts . it responds like a human does . it learns . it adapts . each time you play , it changes its strategy .
so what 's so different about arcade ? you guys 've been talking about it for months .
we 're glad you people could make it , and we 're anxious to have you try out our new product . we think it 's going to be a big seller . but you 're the people that make it happen . you 're the market share everyone 's tearing each other apart to get at . it 's your opinion that 's going to make or break us .
i am giving her a chance . why do n't you get off my back ?
give her a chance , will you ?
so start at the beginning ...
i am the truth teller . where should i take you ?
i am the liar . where should i take you ?
one of these cities , is the place you seek . the teller of truths will take you there . but the city of lies , is dark and bleak . and death is certain if you enter , beware .
of course i can . i can say all sorts of things ...
can you say anything but `` cool '' ?
cool .
fucked up . that 's what they said i was .
it means she 's screwed up .
git along little dowgie and call me back .
okay , but you do n't know what you 're missing .
i understand , cynthia and thank you for the offer . i 'll find a place . now go ahead and give the cowboy a yodel and get back to me .
i 'm just offering a place to stay .
cynthia ... that would not be a good idea .
i 'll call him , then call you back ... if you want you could stay at my place .
yeah , sure . it is that kind of a day . when ?
will you meet with him ?
you got ta be kidding ?
sort of , funny boy . if i tell him the meeting 's on you 're to go to the top of beachwood canyon . there 's a corral up there where he 'll be .
and getting stranger . where do i meet this cowboy ? i mean do i have to ride out to the range ?
it 's been a very strange day .
cynthia ... what 's going on ?
something tells me this guy is connected with what 's happening , adam , and i think you should do it and i think you should do it right away .
oh , jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the cowboy . should i wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters ?
yeah , the cowboy . this guy , the cowboy , wants to see you . jason said he thought it would be a good idea .
the cowboy ? ?
do you know somebody called the the cowboy ?
beverly hills hotel . i 've got enough cash in my pocket for one night .
i know , but you 're broke . where are you ?
but i 'm not broke .
you 're broke !
and ?
someone called me . when they could n't get you they told me you were as good as broke . i did n't believe then , so i made some calls .
what do you mean `` you know '' ?
i know . where are you adam ?
someone 's shut off my money !
i 'm going home . i 'll call you later .
adam , this is n't like you . please come to the office . there must be something we can do .
i 'm going home cynthia .
home ! meet me at the office . we 've got to do something ... you 've got to do something adam !
i 'm going home .
you 've got to talk to ray you 've got to fix this .
no .
ray did ... and then they closed the set ... . everybody 's gone . you 'd better get down here adam !
who fired everyone ?
they fired everyone .
what did you say ?
they 've closed the set . they sent everybody home .
what 's going on , cynthia ?
adam , where are you ?
and you 'd better speak to someone too ... or find yourself another client ! ! this smells like a set-up to me ! and by the way , ray , i do n't know who these guys are kidding , but every foot of film i 've shot is in a vault at the lab that only i can access . no one 's getting that film ! !
i 'll speak to someone .
you 'd better fix this , ray ! ! !
interest ? ! there 's six of the top actresses that want this thing .
we 'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you 'd be pleased to know there 's quite a lot of interest in this role .
so why did you idiots bring me here ? ... i 'm in the middle of making a picture .
there is no problem .
so what 's the problem ?
okay .
no , this one does n't count . it 's part of the original one . so then ... until we meet again .
so , this is the last time i see you then unless i do bad ?
you 're an understandin ' fella .
i understand .
good then , but , just in case , that bank 's gon na stay closed a bit longer . you understand that ?
it will work out .
now i know a few things . i know you have had a rough day . you 're probably thinkin ' i do n't know the half of it , but in actual fact i know every part of it . the business of gittin ' thrown off your movie , the heartache of seeing your wife with another man ... losin ' access to that precious film vault ...
okay .
so let 's just say i 'm drivin ' this buggy and you fix your attitude and you can ride along with me .
one .
there 's sometimes a buggy . how many drivers does a buggy have ?
look ... where 's this going ? what do you want me to do ?
no . you 're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin ' . now i want ya to think and quit bein ' such a smart aleck . can ya do that for me ?
okay , i 'm thinking .
well , just stop for a little second and think about it . will ya do that for me ?
how 's that ?
so since you agree i guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life .
that a man 's attitude determines to a large extent how his life will be .
what did i say ?
i agree with what you said ... truly .
now ... did you answer cause you thought that 's what i wanted to hear or did you think about what i said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right ?
sure .
a man 's attitude ... a man 's attitude goes some ways toward how a man 's life will be . is that somethin ' you agree with ?
whatever .
well now , here 's a man who wants to get right to it . kinda anxious to get to it are ya ?
no problem . what 's on your mind ?
sure want to thank ya for drivin ' all the way up to see me from that beverly hills hotel .
yeah .
beautiful night .
howdy to you .
howdy !
have a good evening , mr. kesher .
fine . i 'll check out in the morning .
that 's fine , mr. kesher . you can pay cash when you check out . i 'm sorry . it was my duty to inform you .
unbelievable . look ... here . i do n't know what 's going on . that 's so much baloney . i 've got enough cash for one night , okay ?
well , sir , i 'm afraid they said you 're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled .
so , what did they say ?
i do n't know . all we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files .
how ... how 'd they know i was here ?
the fact is mr. kesher a representative of your bank called us .
... what ? ?
i 'm sorry mr. kesher , but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card .
yes ... what is it ?
good luck , honey !
right . see ya .
get going . you do n't want to be late .
thanks coco . i 'll let you know .
naw ! he would n't have cared . just give him a good performance and he 'll be happy and i 've got a feeling you 'll do just that .
thanks coco . it 'd be so embarrassing
his name 's wally brown ... . great guy . been in the business since forever .
no , no . i 'm on my way to my audition . before i go i wanted to ask you if you could remember the man 's name ... aunt ruthie 's friend who helped put this together . it completely went out of my mind .
it 's all right gorgeous . something wrong ?
sorry to trouble you , coco .
do n't make me out to be a sucker . louise bonner says there 's trouble in there . you remember last night . sometimes she 's wrong , but if there is trouble - get rid of it .
you 're really something coco ... thank you .
not really . i met her in junior college and she was from this other town .
so i guess your grandpa and grandma know her .
coco ... she 's very nice . we went to school together .
sweetie , look at me straight .
it 's just for a night or two , until she finds her own place . i tried to explain that to aunt ruth , but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up . i kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she did n't know any ritas ...
she wants to know who 's staying in her apartment .
i was afraid of that .
your aunt called me .
you got it ! see you later honey .
oh coco thank you . thank you so much .
now i guess you and your aunt have an understanding . so here 's the key and you need anything , just give a holler . everybody in this building 's pretty much okay with me or they would n't be here . if you want , later i 'll introduce you around . no hard feelings if you do n't , and do n't forget the rooftop garden . it 's just up the stairs we passed . it 's open to all the tenants . you can see the hollywood sign from there .
wow !
i told ya .
it 's unbelievable !
i can hardly wait , coco .
that 's good . they 're allowed , but i do n't like 'em ... for obvious reasons . one man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo . you would n't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let 's see your aunt 's apartment ... it 's a good one .
no , i do n't .
sweetheart , you do n't know the half of it .
i guess i 've come to quite a place .
honey , all the great ones came through here at one time or another .
have many famous actors and actresses lived here ? i was meaning to ask you that .
you probably do n't remember her , but louise bonner lives right over there in number 29. when she is n't drunk she runs a damn good acting class .
i ...
you do n't have to tell me . it 's written all over that pretty face of yours.. you came here to be an actress . i just hope you 'll remember there 's never been a great poem called `` tits and ass . ''
well , i ...
damn lot of corn raised in hollywood these days too .
yes , he is . he raises corn .
i guess it was your grandfather , was it ... he called me to check in , said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in . nice man ... farmer i hear .
hi ... do you work with my aunt ?
my name is rita .
oh my god . i 'm sorry . i 'll let you get back to that . i 'm going to get unpacked .
i think so . i was just taking a shower .
are you okay ?
a car ... a car accident .
i understand . i saw the dress . i ... i 'm sorry . are you all right ?
there was an accident . i came here .
i 'm ruth 's niece . my name 's betty . i 'm sure she told you i was coming .
that 's okay .
well then , take a seat everyone . betty why do n't you join jimmy and we 'll play the scene . is there anything you 'd like to say bob ... something to betty before they begin ?
no , no , i 'm fine .
well . shall we get to it ? would you like a water or a coffee before we begin ?
hi .
come in . i 'd like you to meet everyone .
very pleased to meet you .
i 'm wally brown . your aunt is a very dear friend of mine so it 's particularly nice to meet you .
yes .
betty elms ?
before what ?
stop ... just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail , so get out of here before ...
but you wo n't .
i can call them ... i can call my dad .
i came back . i thought that 's what you wanted .
you 're still here ?
yeah ... betty . you do n't rush it . i do n't rush it . we play it close , just like in the movies .
betty .
i want to play this one close , bob . like it was with that girl , what 's her name , with the black hair . that felt good . whaddya think ?
what ?
just tell me where it hurts , baby .
may i have your name please ?
was anyone hurt ?
no . i ca n't .
can you tell me what happened ?
yes , there was .
hi . i 'm inquiring ... well , i heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and i want to know if there was an accident on mulholland drive .
i 'll go with you . she 's still got some of my stuff .
well ... we 'll leave her a note .
i switched apartments with her . she 's in # 17. just walk down that way . it 's just to the right .
but it said # 12 .
number 17 .
diane ?
yes ?
hey , let 's introduce the brand new you to hollywood . we have n't seen the roof garden yet .
it sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new .
no . we should n't touch that money . we do n't know about that money . that might be dangerous money . you have to start all over again . you look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person ... whoever you want to be .
but i want to .
rita ... i want you to stay here and you do n't have to give me that money .
i know what you have to do , but let me do it .
what ... i..have ... to do .
rita ... i know what you 're doing .
no .
c'mon help me in . i 'll open the front door .
i do n't think ...
keep going . go around to the back .
no ... but ...
do you know them ? !
those men in front , in the car .
what is it ? what do you see ? !
do n't stop !
you 're not going to get in trouble . you 're going to find out who you are . finding out who you are gets you out of trouble .
but i do n't know , sol . i never heard of sol . i 'd just get in trouble . that 's why we should n't go see about diane selwyn ... it 's better not to get in trouble .
why did n't you ask him ? sol knows you !
okay .
when i get back i 'll have the cab waiting , so be ready to go .
good luck !
i hope i 'm back in a couple of hours . do n't drink all the coke .
everything is a-okay , but i 've got ta get that sandwich !
is everything all right ? is it bad for you that i 'm here ?
you 've got to eat something . you 're just nervous about going over to see if you 're diane selwyn .
i 'm all right .
oh , no wonder i 'm starving . i 'm going to fix a sandwich . you want one ?
`` then they 'd put you in jail . ''
`` before i kill you . ''
`` before what ? ''
`` stop ! just stop ! that 's what you said from the beginning . if i tell what happened ... they 'll arrest you and put you in jail , so get out of here before ... ''
`` what about you ? what will your dad think about you ? ''
`` get out ! get out before i call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend . this will be the end of everything ... ``
`` you know what i want ... it 's not that difficult . ''
`` you 're playing a dangerous game here . if you 're trying to blackmail me ... it 's not going to work . ''
`` but you wo n't ... ''
`` i can call them ... i can call my dad ... ``
`` so ... surprise '' ...
`` my parents are right upstairs ! they think you 've left ... ''
`` really ? ''
`` i came back . i thought that 's what you wanted . ''
`` you 're still here ? ''
i know you 're afraid of something . we 'll be careful . tomorrow we 'll go over there and we 'll find out .
i 'm not sure about this .
what 's wrong with that ?
maybe ... maybe ... maybe .
maybe the voice is n't diane selwyn . maybe that 's your roommate or if it is diane selwyn she can tell you who you are .
it 's not my voice ... but i know her .
call the number .
maybe it 's not me .
strange to be calling yourself .
we 'll take our check .
no . just the coffee .
not that i can see .
there 's nothing ?
come on ... let 's find you something to wear .
okay .
just to see if there was an accident on mulholland drive .
okay ... but just ... just to see .
we could call anonymously from a pay phone ... just to see if there was an accident .
no ... . i do n't ...
maybe that 's where the accident was . there must be a police report . we could call .
that 's where i was going ... mulholland drive .
mulholland drive ?
mulholland drive .
when you think about them ... the money ... the key ... does it make you remember anything ?
unh , unh .
the money . you do n't know where it came from ?
no there is something ... something there i ca n't tell ... i ca n't describe it . there are things there ... . but i 'm ... here .
you do n't remember anything else ?
i do n't know .
how do you remember how to talk ?
nothing . i do remember the car crash ... i told you ... i remember the glass ... i think about that sometimes ... i remember walking here , sort of . now i remember this place and you . that 's about it .
well ... if you do n't remember anything , i mean what goes through your mind then if you do n't remember anything ?
what do you mean ?
well ... what do you think about then ? i mean ... well what do you think about ?
i 'm not . i do n't know what my name is . i do n't know who i am ! !
what do you mean ? you 're rita .
i do n't know who i am .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm ... i 'm ... oh no ... i thought when i woke up ... i thought sleep would do it ...
what is it rita ?
all right , but ... i 'm going to check on you .
it will be okay if i sleep . i need to lie down and sleep .
if you have a concussion you should n't sleep .
no ... i need to sleep .
but , this could be serious .
no .
oh ...
i think i 've been hurt .
she sure is . she 's letting me stay here while she 's working on a movie that 's being made in canada , but i guess you know that . i could n't afford a place like this in a million years . unless of course i 'm discovered and become a movie star . of course , i 'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star , but sometimes people end up being both and that is , i guess you 'd say , sort of why i came here . i 'm sorry , i 'm just so excited to be here..i mean i just came here from iowa and now i 'm in this dream place . you can imagine how i feel .
she has pretty red hair ... she is very kind i think .
i ... i mean ... ... i ... it 's none of my business .
no ... ... ... .i .
thank you ... thank you very much .
let 's see if we have a pass for betty elms ... and we do . here we go . and good luck miss . elms .
betty elms .

you 're so easy .
my next delivery is up that way , so i 'll be getting down to it real soon .
no , no , no , i told you . they 're fine . they 're all real happy .
yeah , sure . look what happened to them .
right then .
to get rid of this god-awful feeling .
so , you came to see if he 's out there ?
well ... it 's the second one i 've had , but they were both the same ... ... they start out that i 'm in here but it 's not day or night . it 's kinda half night , but it looks just like this except for the light , but i 'm scared like i ca n't tell ya . of all people you 're standing right over there by that counter . you 're in both dreams and you 're scared . i get even more frightened when i see how afraid you are and then i realize what it is - there 's a man ... in back of this place . he 's the one ... he 's the one that 's doing it . i can see him through the wall . i can see his face and i hope i never see that face ever outside a dream .
okay , so you had a dream about this place . tell me .
you see what i mean ...
oh boy .
i had a dream about this place .
go ahead .
it 's kind of embarrassing but ,

i just wanted to come here .
why did you want to go to breakfast if you 're not hungry ?
damn , that 's a long drive .
palmdale .
where at ?
yeah ... and they both use the same address .
interesting .
nope , not yet . their fingerprints do n't match up anywhere .
find out who they are ?
well he said ... you know in his way ... you know what i mean ? besides the guy gettin ' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad , there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal , you know , off the car body , rolled out and slid up through this guy 's neck and just kinda slit his aorta , you know , but they did n't find it right away , so the guy 's losin ' a lot of blood , you know , to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself , he said , while inside the aorta is bleedin ' pretty steady all that time . so , dr. scott 's laughin ' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy . he 's laughin ' you know and shakin ' ... son of a bitch could n't stop laughin ' ... it was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin ' ... the nurse was laughin ' . you know how he is .

no one has a gun to your head .
i 'm an investment banker . i see blood bathes everyday . besides , mine is not to question why , min is but to do or die .
does n't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? i mean , i can understand the old man 's infatuation with the stuff , but not you .
yeah , i 'd say that 's it .
is that it ?
bye ... .
well , i 'll see you at the next staff party .
yeah a real shame .
that 's a shame .
apparently pretty high , we just got a new ceo last week .
well , surprise , surprise , i 've been on the payroll for several years now . i still have an office and secretary . no one even batted an eyelash . do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in new york ?
that was eleven years ago .
i work here , remember ?
what are you doing here ?
it 'll end . it 'll end with him and mccay . then the park shuts down . permanently .
just stop it . end it here .
there 's one more person here for me to visit .
what about you ?
girder , watch your head .
what was that ?
yes .
do you know where you 're going ?
it 's poison gas , this is the antidote . drink it .
i do n't get it .
the brooklyn bridge .
where are we going ?
great ...
you do n't . it 's random , there no trick .
okay mr inventor , how do we avoid it ?
yeah , real cute . the storm is fake , but the lightening is real .
this is cute .
let 's go .
if we can get to through the next room , we 'll be at a junction for a power grid .
fine ...
you okay ?
okay .
just remember , hold your breath as long as you can . then go right over to that corner . the door will open and go in and up .
so was i. so do n't give me any shit . your business is just as bad . at least i 'm up front about it . you kill people slowly . your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two . now you know how it feels .
it was n't my fault . i was just part of a team . i was doing my job ...
know what ? that it was your fault ?
i wanted to let his family know ... .
you did n't think about it did you ? i read your file . it said you had a nervous breakdown .
i ... i ... ..
i 'm in charge of the conversions . when first bank buys another smaller bank , i 'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things .
what do you do with the company , if i might ask ?
how can you just take a life ? i mean it 's a life , life is so precious . how does it feel ?
this is new york . no one notices anyone . not even when someone disappears . at first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal mccay 's jag . then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions . the old man got such a rush from it , i thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours .
does n't anyone notice all the people missing ?
i 've since changed my mind . i designed this place , based on my belief that i was doing what the legal system could n't or would n't do . mccay had the company buy the property and they pay the bills . it 's a tax write off . on the books everything looks kosher . i have an office on 5th that i have n't seen in ten years .
and you believe that ?
mccay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated , but reveal everything . like criminal impulses , homicidal impulses ... ..
what do you mean ?
there 's more to it than trying to see if you 'd steal from the company or if you 'd lie or cheat .
yeah , everyone has to when they get hired .
there are other things too . they had everyone start taking those psych tests . did they make you take one ?
so you may have been duped this whole time . killing innocent people , that must make you feel ... , how does it feel ?
it was there , clear as day . i saw the computer records . matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account . i just knew something was wrong .
then how come matt and i showed up as guilty ?
i do a very thorough background check . i go through police files , personel files , anything .
but how do you know if the people are guilty ?
i was lured by all the money and i truly did convince myself that what i did was for justice . since then , mccay has wanted to put anyone he can down here .
i was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine . i was originally brought in as a technical advisor . first bank had sponsored my scholarships .
he hired you to build this place ?
i just graduated from m.i.t . in engineering . that 's when john mccay hired me .
do you have something better to talk about ?
is this really the time ?
why did you build this whole place ?
excuse me ?
so why this ?
i 'd say about thirty to forty minutes . give or take a few .
how long till the room fills ?
once the room depletes it 's oxygen , we have about 30 seconds , then a door opens on the bottom over there . then we swim out .
obviously , but what 's the way out ?
we drown .
what 's the trick here ?
at the subway station , we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant does n't know about .
i 'm listening .
look , there 's another train . they 'll send it through here . you 're fucked if you do n't stop and listen to me .
not listening !
it wo n't take them that long to figure out we were n't on the train when it wrecked .
you 've been doing a bang up job so far . right now matt is probably dead and it 's your fault .
hey ! i 'm still your best chance to get out of here alive .
i 'm not listening .
so you 're telling me you were set up ? i knew something was wrong .
why would he ? his parents are rich .
then he is n't embezzling either is he ?
no ! i would n't do that .
then you did n't give him any passwords of any kind ?
i 'm not boffing matthew !
if you had n't started boffing that weasel with an attitude , you would n't be here .
look i do n't even wan na know how i got in this mess . i just want out . it has nothing to do with me .
you took an awful big risk back there .
what ?
hey ! hey ! i 'm talking to you !
i 'm leaving .
what are you doing ?
knows ? he watches every `` guest '' on tape . this whole place is here for his sick amusement . and no so are we .
mccay knows ?
it 's a tax write off for john c. mccay .
first bank ? but how ?
it 's called murderland . it 's paid for by first bank .
who the hell are you anyway ? what is this place ?
i 'm working on it .
so what do we do ?
no where . we 've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall .
so where does this lead ?
give me a fucking ... ..
come on , it works .
you have issues . i mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out .
there 's enough force to push you twenty feet in the air . it wo n't kill you , but it will hurt .
we have to climb up that .
now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
we wait . this is an elevator .
how do we get out of this room ?
i do n't know .
now where do we go ?
i 'm not fucking him..
maybe not , but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory . he stole your passwords .
embezzling ? i 'm not embezzling !
you 're both embezzling . i saw the records .
you said we were criminals , what did you mean ?
why should i ?
why do n't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
no !
leave him , he 's dead .
what about matt ?
i made this place ... .. now listen to me . i 'll get out of this room , we have bigger troubles than this ... .
why should we trust you ?
no time . get him up .
where are we ?
please do n't be alarmed , ma'am .
what 's going on ?
you have 43 unpaid parking tickets , sir . you have the right to remain silent , anything you say can & will be held ... ..
do n't have to tell me twice .
he 's the liaison for mccay . listen go . go now .
in the jail cell is a spiral staircase . it leads to the surface . take it all the way up .
where ?
almost . look , you two get out of here .
is it over ?
thanks ...
knock yourself out .
this probably is n't the bet time , but i really have to pee . can i pee ?
ow ...
you okay ?
swimming , you know , like in water , moron .
what the fuck are you talking about .
hey , try swimming . it works .
that 's cute asshole .
issues ? ? ? this guy has the damn subscription to every psychotic issue i 've ever heard of .
look ...
that 's not to tough .
look pipsqueak , i 'm having a real bad day here and we 're just starting .
why do n't you tell us a little about yourself ?
it 's fine thanks .
yeah , we 're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations . we 're heading a little higher up now .
an elevator ?
you were one of those guys that played dungeons & dragons with real swords , were n't you .
the room has sound sensors . if you wake it up , it breathes fire .
are you hunting wabbits ?
be very , very quiet ...
so what happened ? did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
a dragon .
what 's next walt ?
i did , but this room has four exits and only one opens , it 's up to them in the control room . there 's one right over there . the exit light is on , but he can change it .
i thought you made this place ?
why ?
i 'd get out of the water if i were you .
that 's nice . i think i lost my wallet .
not quite ... .
is it over ?
because of my charming personality ?
give me one good reason why i do n't plug you right here , right now ?
i do n't help criminals .
hey buddy , thanks for the help back there !
and that 's different than this because ... ... ?
either you 'll be shot with bullets , impaled with a large spike , or nailed like a super model . basically you 're fucked any way you go .
okay , now i 'm worried . what exactly is on the other side of the door ?
trust me , if you open any door , you 'll be dead a whole lot sooner .
wait for what ? i do n't wan na alarm you but we 'll be the special at the international house of pancakes in about five minutes !
no ! do n't open any of them ! they 're all wrong . just wait .
i told him not to sit down in there ... ..
ouch ! ! ! goddammit that hurts ! ! ! !
just shut the fuck up .
who are you anyway ? what the hell is this ?
no . do n't . you 'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat .
43 unpaid parking tickets , sir .
kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets .
hey , hey !
that 's very funny , sir . you are under arrest .
yes , can i help you ? maybe a donut or something ?
are you matthew parker ?
for once in your life , shut the fuck up .
you think i 'm that easy , bitch ?
i 'm sick of playing . i 've got a better idea .
why do n't you just stop fucking around and just die !
checking ... ... ..
a real criminal ... . i still think that 's our in ... what about her ?
yeah , but we 're talking 43 .
parking tickets ? that 's it ?
checking ... .. hah ! he has a shit load of unpaid parking tickets ...
any priors ? any police record ?
matthew lives on the upper west side , kinda posh for a temp do n't you think ?
yeah , maybe ... . let 's start the background checks . let 's see where they live and what kind of security systems ... .
he probably has a history of this shit .
he already had a balance of $ 600,000 .
so ?
i see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months . each one in the amount of $ 100,000 . he then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account .
i just want to double check the facts .
what 's wrong ?
that 's right . now who needs to trust who ? trust me , when you 're ready to work the controls , i 'll put you in the hot seat .
you did .
and who bailed you out when a hit was put on you , you sorry sack of shit . who put you up ? who gave you a job ?
i made my bones on the street , you know . i did riglioni in his own house . i was made in the family , okay .
no .
i 've been working with you for four years , do n't you think that 's worthy of at least one turn at the controls ?
not down here . i 'll start trusting you when i feel there the time is right . it 's not personal , it 's just survival .
respect is earned not given away , trust is given away to anybody .
trust is earned not given away .
look , you 're going to have to start trusting me sometime . i am a trustworthy person .
when you are ready .
when will that be ?
when i think you 're ready .
here . am i ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
hand me the 3/8ths .
you 've got it boss . one more mangled body to the east river , coming up !
johnny , let 's get the cleanup started .
got it .
stop the hydraulics .
i said no .
but , he 's ...
not yet .
he 'll never get it right . try the log ride !
you 've got to be kidding me ! his lazy ass could n't win the special olympics .
never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes . his file says he is an avid jogger .
yes , sir mom .
it 's my control board and i do n't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard , no put the shit away .
what ? are you my mother ?
do n't eat at the console .
what ?
do n't .
let 's just see if he can make it into round two ... .
i did n't think he 'd make it past scraps .
we will start work on it now sir .
if you want , i can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people . which will it be ?
sir , i came from the chicago offices myself , and if i may say , sir , there are still some very good ... .
fire the whole division . we 're moving more of the operations division into manhattan anyway . whoever is left over from the conversion is no longer needed . we already have all the key people here . anyone else is expendable .
excuse me , sir ?
fire the whole division .
well ?
have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning . first ... . thing ...
sir ? we 're moving them right along as fast as we can .
fantastic ! a little faster sweetheart .
yes sir . it will be the best of your collection , i assure you .
not you zach . remember , my wife is asleep upstairs , dear . zach , am i gon na like what i see on this tape ? is it the grandest of all the park 's tapes ?
sir ?
one moment dear ...
better , sir .
is it as good as i hope it is ?
good , sir .
zach , my boy ! how is tonights adventure going ?
zachary .
that my boy , is the best part . life on top of the world is boring ... predictable . if i wanted life without chances , i never would have paid for murderland . now go . make a formal proposal and see about the assistant . find out if it 's viable .
sir , this is not like firing any employee . we ca n't predict what will happen .
yes , do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
john , sir .
do you think the assistant , what 's his name ...
what then sir ? what would we do with the park with out bruce ?
i 'm willing to bet that even the creator ca n't out wit his creation .
sir , he created the park . he would know how to circumvent any of the traps .
i 'll bet that would be the park run of the century !
sir ?
what if we were to put bruce into the park as a guest ?
what do you mean sir ?
i propose we consider a hostile take over . perhaps ol ' bruce is in need of a new job opportunity .
bruce may still refuse . it is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent .
that mail room kid was the longest lasting `` guest '' yet ! maybe we can alter the computer records and make another `` guest '' from the more athletic of our staff .
yes sir . it turns out we put an innocent man into the `` park '' and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine . that is also about the time when bruce began refusing .
what about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the `` park '' ? was n't that a computer glitch ?
that 's right , sir . he does a thorough background check and if he finds them to be criminal or guilty of embezzlement , then he will put them in the park . he has refused the last three suggested `` guests '' .
i do n't believe ol ' bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did . he still insists on the `` guests '' being of the more nefarious type .
but sir , most of the people we are putting into the `` park '' are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers . they are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess .
i want more action . i want to see more ingenuity than that . i want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
i had suggested that they tone down the program so that the `` guests '' might take longer to expire .
that was rather ... . disappointing .
son , let 's watch the tape .
thank you , sir . i was really hoping for shares , or possibly cash ... but this , this is really personal .
thank you , sir .
i have entrusted you with a great many things . in your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live . i think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded .
yes sir .
zach my boy , i can spend your yearly salary in a blink . i have had that kind of money all of my life . if i wanted to , i could fly to paris for the afternoon . my father formed this company over seventy years ago . when my brother became mentally challenged , it was put in my charge . now running a bank of this size is very stressful . i need to relax on what little down time i have . a yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline . understand ?
i make roughly four hundred thousand a year .
and how much do we pay you annually ?
i am thirty two .
zach , how old are you , son ?
while i am not morally against these little , shall we say `` hobbies '' , as long as i am on the payroll , but why not something like a yacht club ?
of course .
thank you , sir . sir , may i ask you a question ?
i have to say , that i am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass .
yes sir , i do . last night 's , fresh from the park .
perhaps it was . i was in boarding school for so many years , it 's hard to remember . do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
i thought that was darwin , sir . or perhaps nietzsche ?
relax , son . they 'll learn in time that you do n't fuck with first bank . this is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong . my daddy always told me that only the strong survive .
not that well sir . i believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building . did we aquire a bank from chicago or a charity ?
zachory ! my boy , how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
yeah , right . he 's stuck all the way over here
go in there ? what if bruce finds you ?
i do n't know . i think that a power grid just needs reset . do n't get your panties in a bunch . i 'll go down and reset it .
how can this happen ?
the power went out in half the park .
what happened ?
what the ... ?
he 's got two chices.either it 's the bowling alley from hell or alice in murderland . see this ? even bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece .
so what 's next ? no one 's ever made it this far before .
i think i 'll see hat action .
okay , i have five that says this is it for them .
goddamn it bruce , you 've cost me about thirty dollars so far .
thank you very much .
the room will fill to the top , then if they wind up in the next room , they lived , if not , they 're dead .
ach ! how will you know if they 've made it ?
< < belch > >
that is repugnant . you have the habits of a goat .
i can see that but where ?
there ! there ! did you see ! they 're still alive !
yes . i think he 's feeling sick or something .
was that the old man ?
you 're paying the bills .
i do n't know . maybe we should watch the tape to be sure .
shit , i forgot about them . well , i guess the boss man was n't as tough as i thought .
look ! look !
i can see your small business ! look at it it 's so small .
look he figured it out !
well , mr. parker it seems that your is not the wardrobe of choice tonight . i 'm quite confident that my tie is looking better than yours .
maybe you should get over fears .
why ? the crocks are all going for the dead crock . there 's no fun in it . besides we 've got plenty more for them . the night is young ... .
are n't you going to switch exits on him again ?
i 'll see that bet .
i 've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now .
i do believe mr. mccray will be most pleased with the tape of this one .
i have a turn for the worse for the team !
what 's next ?
of course , this one 's a gim me . just be patient , even ol ' bruce ca n't outwit some of these traps .
will he make it out ?
he 'll never make it out of the park alive . i promise you that ... .
we ca n't afford too many surprises .
he must have had a gun stashed . god damn it !
what was that ?
i do n't know ... ..
what is bruce doing ?
what ? ? ? ? ?
bruce has just awaken .
we should have another fifteen minutes at least .
how long till the drug wears off ?
are n't you the bitter one .
just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life .
so who are these people with the boss ?
i 'm listening .
i had hoped you would say that . i have a proposal for you ... ..
no i am not .
are you happy with your salary and position ?
we ca n't .
i did n't think even this company could afford to write off enough to build a new `` park '' .
have you ever considered running your own `` park '' ? i mean , since you will not be returning to your former profession .
then what do you want ?
no . i am not a homosexual .
what are you looking for ? a blow job ?
i thought , and correct me if i 'm wrong , but were n't you trying to play both sides ?
there was a bit of confusion on one of my last jobs .
might i ask why you no longer work for the mob ?
i was .
only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob . that if you wanted a good clean kill , that johnny tortelli was the man for the job .
what did you hear ?
no . i was just curious if what i heard about you is true ?
he 's been expecting you .
we have new `` guests '' for the park . i have a file on them . may i see bruce ?
hey , mr. executive . buy you a drink sailor ?
i 'm just looking for our best interests . may i have the tapes , bruce ?
he has a phone pole sticking in his chest , i think we do n't need an autopsy .
i 'm going to go ahead and go now .
why do n't you shut up now .
no sir . i was just getting , well you know . water . we were n't talking about sex or anything else except star wars . just saying hello . i think i 'm gon na go now .
well , i think if you take several lines out of context , star wars becomes a very sexual movie . i mean listen to this . `` luke , at that speed will you be able to pull out in time ? '' or `` you came in that thing ? you 're braver than i thought '' .
no .
ow . son of a ... .. did i ever tell you my theory on star wars as porn ?
of course i am . i feel the testosterone coursing through my veins . now that i 've gotten the stitches removed from my arm and the chiropractor fixed my back .
hey buddy . you okay ?
hey good lookin ' ! what'cha got cookin ' ?
who was that guy anyway ?
he was right behind me !
come to the rescue again i see .
thanks a lot . i always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight .
where are we ?
no , idiot . where do we go now ?
i want to go to sleep for about a month .
what now ?
we made it !
sweet jesus i never dreamed i 'd be glad to see central park at night .
i was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again , but maybe the epcot version will be open by then ... .
hey matty , do n't wait for me or anything .
i 'm fine .
are you okay ? any holes ? i mean aside from the one 's that nature gave you ?
zach from work ?
it 's that asshole zach is n't it ?
nothing .
what ?
i think i 'm very quickly getting over my phobia of public urination .
shut up ! it 's me .
jesus christ ! i 'm just a temp for christ sakes !
`` how 's your foot '' ? this guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place , and you want to know how his foot is ?
how 's your foot ?
we just having our first date when you showed up .
you do n't have to sound so emphatic .
maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears .
i 'm talking to you asshole !
which one , this door is locked !
the roof is coming down ... . hey , you ... . which door gets us out of here ? ?
fine , fine , i feel like a chicken mcnugget .
are you okay ?
i just need to sit and think for a second .
i think we should follow him ...
what the hell kind of cop are you ?
hey , you ! what the hell is going on ?
no ! just get up . this is serious .
hey ... did we uhm , you know ... .
wake up , we 're in trouble .
not now , mom .
yahoo ! ! ! ! !
okay , now go under go under it ! shoot vader 's tie fighter ! get him get him !
my own sit down star wars arcade game . wan na play it ?
actually , i 'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer . so what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
would that impress you ? i mean you 're the kinda woman that probably has ferrari written all over your personal ad .
like what , a porsche ? a ferrari ?
i just want to have something that 's mine , you know ? it 's like living off of their money is fun and all . there are certain materialistic needs that i have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch .
if they 're so rich , why are you working at all ?
well , i make good investments , i lead a double life as a secret agent.. i ... .i ... i have very rich parents . i have always had a lot of money .
you have a real nice place ... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
yes , excuse me for a second .
are you okay ?
thank you .
what an incredible view !
thanks .
thank you , wo n't you come in ?
hi . i brought some wine .
hello .
sure .
dinner at my place then ? say , seven o'clock ?
as appealing as that sounds ...
this is too easy , i mean i had a speech prepared , then i even wore these pants because i could get on my knees to grovel .
yes .
really ? on a date ?
yes .
it 's sounds so much better when you say it . i 'm semi traditional here , and it 's important that i ask . will you go out with me ?
do you want to go out with me ?
listen , i was thinking , you know . would you go , it 's i think you 're ...
i 've never heard the flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that . you 're funny .
come on , i 'm serious . look at wilma . she 's this frail little thing , and fred , i mean fred flintstone is this big guy . he has to be hung like a horse , and that 's why wilma puts up with his b.s .
excuse me , gentlemen
just look at this tie . you could fry an egg off that orange , yow . have you ever considered the jerry garcia line of ties ?
i meant him .
thank you .
good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
maybe we should make the time . especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events .
look , miss . i know you 're still upset about that incident in chicago , but understand , this is a cut throat business . we do n't have time to play nursemaid to every single tom dick and harry .
i disagree . i think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can ... ..
we start with the top and work our way down . we start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go . no need to make the blue collars go crazy .
were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ? i am sorry . perhaps we should have dinner tonight to ... . discuss your future .
four years . i came over from the capitol merger in chicago six months ago .
i am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market . how long have you been with the company now ?
actually it 's down .2 from the last quarters highest , but i think it will pick up .
did you see what the first bank stock opened at ? very impressive .
good morning .
good morning .
humph , meee ? ? my dear , this is not a country that rewards poetry , this is a country that rewards gas mileage , besides , people do n't read poetry anymore , they watch television . do n't be a poet , be a tv repairman .
no they 're not . i wan na be a writer , i wan na be just like you .
oh i doubt it ... lectures are notoriously boring .
i 'm sure she found your lectures fascinating .
i was drinking a little in those days . i 'm drinking a little these days too .
people said she looked like me .
ohhhhh .
her name was maggie muldovan .
ucla ? my cardigan sweater period .
my mother took this course with you at ucla ... & quot ; the foundations of poetic thought & quot ; .
no , no , no , i gave it up ten years ago ... actually it gave me up .
do you still teach ?
oh , just put it over there .
umm , where do you want this ?
no , i 'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to caracas , venezuela ... do you know any know anybody in caracas , venezuela ?
are you writing a poem ?
you had to remind me ?
i do n't even know your name .
do n't mention it .
thank you .
yeah , well i do n't think you 're very grateful . a lot of people in your position would say & quot ; thank you & quot ; .
i do n't think you 're very polite .
what are you gon na do ? tell them that ... a polite person helped carry your bag ?
put that down , i 'll ... i 'll call the police !
gee , that is a problem .
my only problem is that your uncle phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but i do n't get paid 'till delivery .
are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem .
well if i was looking for a victim , i definitely would n't pick your uncle phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds , besides , who would i ask for ransom ? you ? ?
this is california , anything is possible .
hey relax , you think i kidnapped him or something ?
where is he ? ? he was supposed to meet me .
your uncle phil told me .
how did you know my name ?
you 're vada right ?
i 'm not supposed to talk to strangers , not even nuns .
excuse me i asked you a question .
me , i 'll know !
so charge him with something ... who 's gon na know ?
you 're still asking me to break the law .
i 'm sorry okay ... we got ta find this guy because ... he knew vada 's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows .
i think the phrase was & quot ; sleazoid geek & quot ; .
look , sergeant i know i said some things last time that i should n't have said at all but ...
i thought i told you to lose this guy .
give us a break . all you have to do is make a phone call .
what about living in the real world pal ?
what about giving the other guy a break .
well maybe you should join a hippie commune . but let me tell you something . sooner or later it 's gon na be your turn to take out the garbage .
i would do it again in a minute .
what kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in ?
hello , i 'm gon na need this right now ... this guy ... well we think he might be going after the governor . twenty minutes ? fine .
do you wan na be a hall monitor all your life ?
could you hold on for a second ?
i 'm leaving sunday .
pommeroy ... he may or may not be driving a black 54 ford pickup . monday .
pommeroy .
yeah , this is sergeant tanaka from holenbeck , i need a current address for a jeffrey ... .
his name is jeffrey pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 ford pickup , black with red interior . please ?
i 'm not authorized to trace licenses for civilians .
everyone was really surprised when maggie was turned in , she got kicked out for two weeks .
suspended from school , my mother ? ?
she was the uhh ... first girl ever suspended for smoking .
you kidding ? he picks up a picture and shows vada and nick
wow , you walked out with my mother ?
well , we worked on the school paper together . i remember when the legion of decency declared rebel without a cause unfit ... boy ... that jim backers , what an actor uh ? what an actor .
what do you remember about her .
it 's too bad about your mom . at least she went peacefully , i 've seen a lot of people go out the hard way .
you can do anything you want . you 're his sister .
can i see him ?
uh huh , a boy , you 've got a new brother .
we have a baby ?
she just had a baby that 's all .
what happened to shelly ?
give my love to shelly .
i love you too sweetie , bye .
okay ... bye daddy , i love you .
oh she 's fine ... ahh ... umm the doctor just ... ehh ... told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and ... 'n stay quiet ... just ... just to make sure that ...
i will . how 's shelly ?
ask him if he needs a good tuba player .
totally .
totally groovy huh ?
yeah .
actually , i wan na see jeffrey pommeroy .
good ! you should go over and watch some ted carson .
i just called to say that i 'm having a really great time .
hi honey .
hi dad .
hello ? sultenfuss parlor .
have fun .
i 'll be back in 137 hours .
thanks , i needed that .
bye dad , i 'll miss you .
it means ... i 'm a paranoid nitwit who 's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he 's a paranoid nitwit . so why do n't you just say & quot ; oh dad & quot ; and get on the damn plane already ?
what does that mean ?
and no boys , promise me , oh those la people are all so corrupt you 'll end up pregnant and on drugs ... and do n't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer ... and do n't make eye contact , it communicates an implied vulnerability .
no nuns , got it .
i used my own money and got a great deal , it 's a q47nr five day fare , which means that i have to change planes in dallas and stay over a saturday .
what ? ?
i already bought a ticket .
honey i know it 's fun to think about these things but ... .
i think that if i 'm old enough to accept a new baby , and if i 'm old enough to accept a new room , i 'm old enough to go to california .
of course .
you were just having a fight about me . would n't you like to hear my opinion ?
oh yes , lovely funeral , gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job , lots of pink roses ... i used the white hearse . hey , how about this flowered wallpaper for your room ?
was it a nice funeral ?
she was talented , but honey i wish i could help you a little more , it 's just that your mother and i had kind of a whirlwind courtship , she came to town with this traveling theater group , i proposed on our second date , two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone .
well , i kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float .
oh , is there anything else you remember , how did you propose ? was it romantic ?
okay , we need wallpaper paste . hey cece !
there 's still a big spot on the floor .
her favorite poet .
the collected works of alfred biedermeyer
honey , ahh , guys do n't wan na appear over anxious , so if you think there 's a boy that might like you , let him know that you like him , so he wo n't feel he 's taking such a risk when he 's thinking of asking you out .
so you 're saying ... what are you saying ? ?
it 's just a question , it 's not about anybody .
what boy likes you ?
dad , when a boy likes you , does he pretend that he does n't like you ? and if he pretends that he does n't like you how can you tell that he likes you ?
great .
seriously .
seriously ?
dad i 'm kidding , you can have the room .
oh yeah , right-between the power mower and the weed killer .
do n't do that , you 've got the whole garage .
hey , why do n't you just keep your room and we 'll put the baby in the back yard .
maybe i should just move to china . one kid per family , that way you do n't lose your room .
honey that 's very mature , i 'm proud of you vada .
no it 's okay , i understand , really .
ahh , strike , not , not bad at all . no , this talk is n't about sex , it 's , well there 've been a lot of changes , and i know you 're upset about losing your room , but the baby 's got ta go somewhere .
i figured you did .
she told me too , i mean , she told me she told you about sex , i personally new about sex long before i met shelly .
shelly 's already told me all about sex .
no , i just thought it 'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could ... talk .
you 're passing up archie bunker to go bowling , you 've got ta have an angle .
me ? what makes you think there 's something on my mind ?
so , what 's on your mind ?
well you know what i mean .
visualize a spare ?
okay thanks , atta girl .
okay , no problem .
well not far , just down the hall . plus grammoo 's room 's a lot bigger , and you get a view of the whole neighborhood .
you want me to move ?
well the thing is your room is right next door to ours , and so we thought , well , i thought , if you were willing we might move you to grammoo 's room , and use your old room for the nursery . see we 're gon na be up half the night with a newborn and there 'll be a lot of noise ... .
do what ?
i do n't know if i can picture uncle phil body surfing .
i got a card from your uncle phil in los angeles today , said he went body surfing .
dad , i 'm trying . the chairs , they wo n't scrunch .
vada , try to scrunch these chairs together a little more .
maybe he 's hungry .
maybe he 's wet ?
i was pushing as fast as i could .
i 'm sorry i could n't come pick you up honey .
phil 's moving to la , grammoo 's passing , the baby being born , vada 's report , i think ...
reason ? what reason ?
i really think we 're going overboard for just a simple school assignment .
oh come on harry , we 're talking about five days here .
yeah and they forgot to ask for one who was n't having hormone surges .
you 're being narrow-minded .
disaster , disaster lurks behind every palm tree .
she is not a child harry , she is a young woman , she 's on the brink of ...
she can spread her wings , right here in pennsylvania . you do n't send a child alone to los angeles , she could come back with her ears pierced , her legs shaved and god knows what else .
ah , well , i bought her this huge pumpkin for halloween , but she could n't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks , and it ended up under the christmas tree .
no .
i told you about the pumpkin did n't i ?
and some taco chips so i can dunk .
how about a nice glass of milk ?
never heard of him .
yes i know , it runs in the family . new book ?
well if there was an article about it i 'm sure she did . she was always reading .
listen , if a boy wants to do homework with you , it really means he did n't have nerve to ask you out on a date , so you 'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying , and the next thing you know you 're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars .
oh , shell , that 's ridiculous , where are my needle nosed pliers ?
look we react to every kick this baby gives , maybe vada 's trying to tell us something too .
oh , she 's fine , she 'll love her new room .
vada i wan na ask you a favor , remember you can absolutely say no if you want to .
i do n't know if i want to .
then i 'll throw up a little bit .
well you should at least try a little bit .
if i eat it i 'll throw up .
hey you 're not eating your meatloaf .
they sure did ! they got kicked out of school , they married truck drivers ... these are my mother 's greatest accomplishments ? i 'm sure glad i came all the way out here to find them out .
oh honey , back then ... people did crazy things .
are you saying my mother had another husband ?
ummmmm , look , i ... i ...
what 're you saying ?
oh . ohhh ?
his name 's harry sultenfuss .
i remember maggie ... and your dad too , you know we used to all pile into his old 54 ford pickup . & quot ; chuck the truck & quot ; we used to call it .
thanks .
i 'm sorry , it 's just ... i 've been taking all these seminars to get in touch with my feelings and ... sometimes it gets out of hand .
it 's okay really , i was just a baby .
maggie muldovan ? did you ... know her ?
are you the hillary mitchell who went to school with maggie muldovan ?
she did n't wan na miss out on anything ... especially motherhood ... it got to be a real problem with us .
oh .
maggie wanted to have a baby ... and ... umm ... i did n't .
honey i 'd be proud to be your father , really . it just is n't so .
well ...
wait ... woah ... woah ... wait a minute ... do you think i 'm your father ?
i guess what i mean is , my mother married my dad after you ... and then i was born , so i thought that ... maybe you got divorced because of me .
i 'd say you turned out just fine .
i thought that ... umm ... maybe you 'd be curious about how i turned out .
well i did n't know about you until after she was gone .
umm ... did n't you ever wonder about me ?
it 's good to see maggie again ... and you .
more than anything in the world .
would you like ... eh ... to have these movies ?
we performed on the beach one summer ... ha ... everything went wrong .
she 's beautiful .
i 've got something better .
do you have any pictures if her ?
well , we did n't have a camera ... so she just wrote the date on the bag and said , & quot ; this will be out wedding album , this will be a day we will never forget. & quot ; we never did .
and she saved it .
i 'll try .
i do n't know very much about her ... i was hoping that you could help me .
yeah like , switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning ... audiences love stuff like that . and your mom knew how to work an audience .
special effects ?
that 's all right , you know what ? you sound just sounded just like your mother ... she told great stories . stories with crazy accents and ... special effects .
i told you it was a long story .

oh she 's great ... she 's a little crazy though . anyway , hillary said that you had a black ford truck and this policeman i know got in touch with motor vehicles and ... he gave me your address and here i am .
hillary mitchell ? how 's she ?
we have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and i chose my mother . she was born in los angeles and since my uncle phil moved out here i came in to visit him and then i looked at her high school yearbook and ... and i called a few people and one guy said that she went to ucla , another guy said that i should call hillary mitchell so ... .
yeah , come on , let 's talk .
you are ?
i 'm glad you 're here .
does she ?
bye . she looks a little like me when i was a little girl .
i 'd like to , thanks .
umm ... can you come in for a minute ?
you mean , you knew about me ?
i was hoping i 'd get to meet you .
maggie ... maggie 's little girl .
i am vada margaret sultenfuss . my mother was ...
sure am , who are you ?
well actually i was born in siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my dad .
so she had you in jail , in russia ?
well ... i 'm not supposed to talk about it , but since i 'm gon na write about it i might as well tell you . she was a spy against the russians .
then what did she do ?
ehh ... i do n't know i mean ... .
hi , wan na help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow ?
hi .
i do n't know . and i do n't care , kevin 's a jerk and i do n't like him anymore . he 's all yours !
that 's ridiculous , so , if you really ca n't stand someone , then you pretend that you 're really crazy about them ?
boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you .
likes me ? he said i looked like a grasshopper .
he likes you .
what 's the matter ?
oh god , he 's coming over here , act natural , totally natural .
see you ? he can smell you from there .
it 's kevin , i do n't want him to see me .
what are you staring at ?
neither can mine . she 's dead . it 's shelly who 's pregnant .
my mother ca n't have any more kids .
you should be here when they bring in a body that 's been dead for a couple of days , and they have n't found it yet , 'cause it was in an apartment , and no-one came to visit , or floating in a river , and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green , you know , like watery pea soup ? the arms and legs deteriorate first , the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs . anyway , this is why i 'm seriously considering cremation . judy ? ?
i know that .
it 's just a corpse .
that 's okay .
come on in !
hi .
that 's simple . she was pregnant with me ... when she went to russia and she did n't know ... and then when the russians found out , they waited to shoot her 'cause you 're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world .
all right , so when did she have you between all her acting and spying and getting caught ?
no , not here in pennsylvania , she went to russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back . just when she was about to go home , she got caught , and they killed her .
oh please , who do you think you 're kidding ? and where did she spy on the russians from , here in pennsylvania ? ?
no-one invented gravity , it just exists .
you 're crazy , what was her big achievement ? did she invent gravity ?
but i wan na write about her .
vada , he was giving you an easy out so you would n't have to write about your mother .
well if it is n't vada , the grasshopper girl .
it 's okay with me , hi kevin .
is it okay if i drink this ?
rose .
i 'm sam helburn . sam .
i guess you have .
then i have come to the right place .
well enrique is great and ... we are the best .
ehh ... i 'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you 're the best jag people in town ... so uhm .
what can i do for you ?
hi .
hello .
are you jeffrey pommeroy ?
hi there ... can i help you ?
you 're alfred beidermeyer are n't you ?
if you 're selling girl scout cookies i 'm borderline diabetic .
he 's writing . hello ?
happy hunting .
o.k . thank you very much .
if it 's in here at all , it 's in the back two rows .
it 's no problem , i had a mother once myself .
this is really very nice of you .
i 'm sure she did .
thanks , but i think i 'm gon na stick to my mom , she led a fascinating life too .
you know i 've been re-reading virginia woolf , i think she 'd be a natural for you , she led a fascinating life .
great , i have so much to say , i hardly know where to start .
hey vada . how 's your report coming ?
i never met my mother .
your mother ?
my mother .
vada what about you , who have you come up with ?
the poem is really about attitude . it 's about not giving up and ... it 's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but ... that 's when we should ... force ourselves to push on .
vada ?
you think this is easy for me ? you go out on the town and i get to be the bad guy . look i do n't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but i ca n't do my job as a parent if you do n't do your job as a kid .
mom !
make that sixty and i 'm docking your allowance for two weeks .
you 're over reacting !
you 're grounded 'till you 're fifty !
you 're so clever .
if the fruit burst into flames i 'll be prepared .
i wo n't .
do n't wake up vada .
i want juice !
there 's water in your bathroom .
i ... ahhh ... umm ... i 'm thirsty .
nicholas ! what are you doing up ?
what ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh ?
but we made a business deal .
give it back nicholas !
thanks
good-bye , look in your backpack .
i 'll write you ten poems . bye .
no ?

write me a poem ?
part adventure ... part miracle .
an adventure ?
i would n't say it was terrible ... it was ... kind of ...
you mean ... it was n't that terrible ?
some sacrifices are worth it .
... umm ... listen , i 'm sorry ... you had to sacrifice your entire vacation .
you better ace it ... you sacrificed our whole vacation .
and i 'm gon na use the movies when i give my report . jeffrey says audiences love special effects .
this has been a real confusing day .
yeah ?
nick ?
that thing you said about your nose ... it was a stranger 's nose ... well it 's not ... it 's ... i mean ... it 's yours ... you know ?
maybe this jeffrey guy is ... is my real father . i mean ... look at me , i have the hair of a dead person and ... and my nose , no one in my family has this nose , it could be the nose of ... a ... of a complete stranger ,
like what ?
maybe not ... but maybe it does . if no one told me about this , i mean ... maybe they 're trying to hide something .
he 's an undertaker .
no , but sometimes he drives a hearse .
no ... it was me . and i 'm sorry mom , really , ju ... just tell me what to do , i 'll do anything .
it 's not his fault !
i already did , it 's a totally barbaric custom ... but on you , it looks good .
marriage can really complicate things . so , are n't you gon na say anything about my earrings ?
good . i mean ...
oh no , we would n't be from the same bloodlines or anything . we 'd be like two total strangers who ... accidentally had relatives that got married .
but we would n't really be related right ?
yeah i guess ... sort of .
and you 'd be my cousin ?
right .
this is a totally barbaric custom .
hey look !
really ?
what do you think ?
what 's he smoking ?
big deal .
that 's 'cause i was cursed with the sultenfuss bear claws . my hands fit .
i 'm afraid your feet wo n't fit in there .
my mother stood on this very spot .
here 's judy garland !
montgomery clift , wait 'till i tell shelly .
never heard of her .
jerk ! you idiot ! ! !
you mean , this ring ?
leave me alone ! !
it 's dangerous ! !
oh no ? ! ? ! ? !
what are you doing ? you ca n't go in there !
owh ...
where are you going ? ? ?
it was an accident , i 'll get you a new one .
in the tar ? ?
... i dropped it .
what do you mean & quot ; uh oh & quot ; ? ? ?
uh oh ...
do n't ! ! !
woah , watch it !
do n't , come on ! ! !
just come and get it ... right here !
just give it to me ! !
come and get it .
give it to me !
hey relax , i 'm not gon na break it .
i want it back now . i never should have taken it off , i want it back .
i 'm not gon na break it , i just wan na see it change colors .
do n't force it , you 'll break it .
maybe it 'll fit my pinkie .
ehh ... okay ... but be careful , it has a lot of sentimental value .
let me see if it changes colors on me .
well , i hope he 's not watching me all the time .
do you think your friend 's up in heaven now , looking down on you and watching you all the time ?
well he was a boy , he was my friend ... he was my best friend . when we were kids we were gon na ... move out here and move to the brady bunch .
boyfriend ?
well , it does n't open cans or anything but it ... it 's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine .
does it work ?
this is n't just a mood ring .
hey what do i care ... i mean , consider the sorts , a chick from pennsylvania , who wears a mood ring .
oh , no wait , i like that you bought me here .
you are weird . let 's just go .
and i thought i was weird .
look at it this way , however bad i feel , it is n't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar .
at least it gives you plenty of exercise .
if he has a heart attack you 're carrying the body down yourself .
he is one of the great poets .
boy , you 're really into this .
may i use the phone please .
just call us the & quot ; dead end kids & quot ; .
you 'd rather have a mother that 's a member of the police state ? rules are made to be broken . just ask him .
you would .
i think it 's cool .
this 'll be great in my report , my mother was suspended for smoking .
care for a smoke ?
who are you ? hitler 's hall monitor ?
you ratted on my mother ? ?
umm , i 'm trying to find out her greatest achievement .
you saved a lot of lives , you should be very proud .
why do you argue with everything i say ?
what if you do n't wan na be found ?
i do n't think anybody should change their names , that way you can always find them when you need them .
what , you think the guy should change his name ?
change my name .
get married ?
i 'd never do that .
do n't forget , the girls change their names if they got married .
i love the fragrance of chilidogs .
it 's the leather bindings , i love the fragrance of vintage books .
yearbooks always set you out for disappointment , i want mine to say : nick probably wo n't amount to much , so do n't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again . can we go ? ... it smells like someone left their gym bag in here .
look , here she is . margaret ann muldovan - newspaper , literary magazine , french club , drama club , debate club , girls basketball and swim team . with maggie 's combo of good looks and talent , we 're sure to be seeing her name in lights . she was gon na be famous .
oh my gosh , here it is !
a big difference , if someone found it we should keep looking , if they did n't we 're just wasting our time .
what difference does it make ?
i never did understand that story , did someone find the needle or not ?
just remember the needle in the haystack .
i do n't mean to alarm you , but i 'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude .
calm down ! we just have to ask ourselves , where your books come from .
what ? ?
vada .
it 's not funny ! i mean what am i gon na do ? without that yearbook i 'm lost . i ca n't just walk around town looking for someone with a wilson high school letter sweater ! ! !
they obviously have no sense of historical perspective either .
excuse me , pardon , thank you , excuse me .
getting off please .
well look , i know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike . it 's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective , i think we 're here .
i did n't ask for the money , phil just gave it to me .
i was n't eavesdropping , i was overhearing .
you know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit .
i got it all figured out , i know she went to wilson high school , so first thing tomorrow , i 'm gon na go there and get a copy of her yearbook . that way i can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were .
and you 're gon na solve the mystery ?
my parents had a brief , but intensely fulfilling relationship . she 's remained a woman of mystery to this day .
taxi ! ! !
i do n't need you to be telling me to ...
yeah , right .
he said it was a gift .
no thanks !
thanks ... .
phil , i think you should consider ... fades as vada walks off
you 're a good man nicholas .
no problem .
well i know you 're not crazy about taking vada around tomorrow , so ... i just want you to know i appreciate it though .
wow !
for the mini-bike fund .
what 's it for ?
ten bucks .
what 's that ?
i 'd consider it a personal favor .
muh ? ?
rose this not the place to be having this ...
i do n't think the color of the interior is ... .
you stay out of this , look , if i had a red xk-150 with a black interior , i sure as hell would n't be handing out relationship advice .
and you certainly should n't settle for anything less that you deserve .
well , wha ... what kind of arrangement ?
who cares ? rose , tell him we have an arrangement .
i 'm not a podiatrist , i 'm a cardiologist .
okay , that does it , that does it , the strudel does it , first it 's brakes then ... . i mean i am not gon na let some podiatrist with a jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and ... .
oh what can i say phil , it 's just that i feel so welcome here .
doctor helburn , what a surprise . in the last couple of days we 've changed your oil , realigned your brakes , balanced and rotated your tires , aligned your front end , and flushed out your entire cooling system , i really did n't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles .
was rose .
well rose was being very thorough .
sounds great , well you give 'em both one of these for me .
dad already gave me this lecture . he 's gon na meet me at the airport , then we 'll go for some pizza , then we 'll have dinner in bed with shelly .
no , you 're the best and i do n't want you talking to anybody on the plane .
okay .
okay ... take your time ... i 'll ... i 'll go for a walk around .
i should do this myself .
you want me to come with ?
well , i 've come this far ... the least i can do is knock on the door .
this is it i guess .
a secret , i like that .
then again , your dad 's got his own memories and he 's got his own life now ... i think this is a secret just between you and your mom .
maybe .
i do n't know , he 's got an awful lot on his mind right now .
do you think i should tell my dad about jeffrey pommeroy ?
then we 'll keep driving ... you 'll decide .
i 'd like to see his house but ... i do n't know if i 'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door . i do n't think i can go through with it .
how 's this for a solution . we 'll take a drive over to his place , you can introduce yourself ... .
i feel like before i can talk to him i have to see his face .
do n't worry , i 'll do it in my own subtle way .
uhh sweetie , i wou ... i wou ... i wou ...
bye .
lock the door .
i 'll do better than that . i 'll send you off with your own private guide .
i had to be , i only have five days . so just point me in the right direction and ... .
vada , i know that traditionally you 're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you 're officially married ... but these are very , very special circumstances .
well then that 's not exactly dating is it .
yes , it does .
so does that mean that you sleep here every night ?
committed .
committed ?
that 's ridiculous , i 'm ... i 'm very , umm , what do you call it ?
sounds like you have a fear of commitment , uncle phil .
dating , seriously dating . you 're thirsty , want something to drink ? sure you do , it 's been a long trip .
but ... are you engaged or something ?
ahh , that 's right , like one big happy family . this is nick 's room and uhh ... .
she lives here too ?
uh huh , well ... good to know . phil hands nick a 5 note
he was very polite , worth the entire five dollars .
how about nick ? did he take good care of you ?
they 're great .
vada ! ! vada runs and jumps into phil 's arms look at you , oh hi , hi , hi ! ! how are you ? you look great , how 's shelly ? your dad ?
is that a yes ?
you really think i look sexy in this smock ?
you like the way i cook ... you think i make out a great invoice . phil you and nick and ... and this ... this garage are my whole life ... i love you . sure you do n't have the greatest taste in music ... but there 's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock . what i 'm try ... what i 'm trying to sa ...
you know how i feel about you .
i think this place is just fine .
i do n't want anything you do n't wan na give me .
you know exactly ... what kind it is . come on rose ... what do you want from me ?
yes , what kind of arrangement ? i 'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have .
no , that 's not a date , a date is when i do n't cook .
wha ... what do you mean ? we have a date every night .
i 'm saying he asked me out for coffee , like a real date , when was the last time you did that ?
wait , are you saying that i do n't appreciate ?
you know where the fire extinguisher is .
there 's plenty of fruit .
we may go out for coffee after the meeting so do n't expect us before midnight .
anyone with taste , anyone with breeding ... . a gentleman , would choose british racing green , with maybe a tan interior ... but when you buy a red car , with a black interior and wire wheels , you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and i 'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is ... in front of the children .
oh , yeah , sure , help yourself .
oh , hi , how 's the investigation going ?
hi !
right now ? an intimate border with ... mechanical skills .
oh ... what 's that ?
god ? no i did n't think you 'd want to invoke god rose , because he saw even more than i did . rose look phil , if you want the rights of a husband , you 're gon na have to ask me something but if not , you 're gon na have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are .
phil for god sake .
he was caressing .
he was n't touching me he was just ... gesturing ...
what 's with the touching , why was he touching you ?
oh i see , 'cause usually that does n't require such a lengthy consultation .
no , there 's no problem , dr. helburn just needs to have his oil changed .
sounds like you 're very organized .
then you 'll be all set .
come on ... i 'll show you where you 're gon na stay .
yeah , well he left out a couple of steps , ah look , i 've got ta get back to these bills , phil will you help vada get settled ?
who knew that when i started working in the finest foreign car shop in la , i would also find the light of my life .
bye niece , vada .
bye aunt rose .
yeah ... right , it 's pointless to worry .
she 'll be all right baby .
shelly 's sick ... i have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there .
well just do n't shave your legs ... he 'll never let you visit us again if i send you home hairless and full of holes .
not exactly .
go to your room . and you ... i do n't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears , did he ?
all right , well get to bed early and do n't let anybody in . bye .
i 'm just tired .
what , did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves ? do n't be misled by the haircut .
you 're nick 's mother ?
i 'll see you then ... i look forward to it .
oh , sure okay .
ahh , why do n't i come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me .
hungarian . famous for their beautiful music ... and beautiful women .
lizt was my parents ' favorite , they were hungarian .
all right , so you do n't like jewelry but ... eh ... you do like ... eh ... good music . liszt , one of my favorites .
oh , well , i do n't wear a lot of jewelry .
where i come from , involvement ... generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry .
let 's just say i ... eh ... i 'm involved .
sort of ?
well i 'm sort of involved .
you could n't ?
oh no , i , i ... eh ... i could n't .
well , even without anesthesia i always tell my patients to ... eh ... to relax .
well let 's just say you 're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia .
something wrong ?
well maybe for you .
good morning .
i 'll be here .
ahh , dr. helburn , why do n't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock , that 's when we open , we 'll get you started .
... so i guess i 'll always ... teach ... you know ... 'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room , i feel i have an obligation ...
yes , i do .
... it 's all in the hands really . you know you have nice hands , you operate ?
mostly ... little babies , but ... not exclusively .
oh , you mean you ... fix the hearts ... of little babies ?
i 'm a pediatric cardiologist .
oh , are you a hairdresser ?
i was commenting on your hair .
excuse me ?
oh , ahh , oil change , i ... ehh ... i just drove in from chicago and uhh ... nice hair .
i mean ... with your car .
nothing , nothing at all .
so what 's wrong ?
o.k .
let me hold him .
you have no idea .
did it hurt a lot ?
i know , look at his little hands .
he 's so tiny .
hey ! oh look .
shelly ?
you leave your father to me .
but dad 'll never go for it .
it would be fantastic .
yeah , it would be kinda great .
oh , but i 'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so .
but what about you and the baby ? you need me .
how would you like to go visit your uncle phil in los angeles ... next week during your spring vacation , you could do research on your mom .
what do you mean ?
why not now ?
i 'm definitely traveling some day .
well you 've got ta be prepared .
i wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere .
uncle phil just needed a change , a little adventure .
is that why uncle phil moved there ?
no . you know they say , that it never rains , that you can barbecue on christmas day ... instead of riding your bike , you just surf over to your friends house . oh , and the place is just crawling with celebrities . i know someone who saw walter matthau picking up his dry-cleaning .
margaret 's my middle name , but everybody called her maggie . los angeles , have you ever been there ?
oh vada she 's so beautiful .
this is one of my favorite things , her passport .
well , it must mean something . she was obviously very sentimental .
i do n't know , dad does n't either .
what 's this ? december 8th , 1958 ?
did she mention any contests that she won ? i mean she must have had some awards , she was so talented and all .
mmmmmm . root beer float that sounds good .
oh no .
then grammoo said on christmas eve , there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house .
you 're telling me .
i know , i guess it 's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life . it 's not easy being a woman .
why do they call them training bra 's ? it 's not like learning to ride a bike .
oh , i was a very late developer , they used to call me & quot ; shelly two backs & quot ; . all my friends had real bra 's , not like the training ones i had .
when did you umm , i mean umm ...
no , the milk comes when the baby comes .
is there milk in them already ?
they 're enormous , i know .
i bet your mom sang to you .
assuming the baby 's a & quot ; supremes & quot ; fan .
this is the street he walks down every day . when he needs inspiration ...
i would have tried to show her a good time . i promised her when she left that i would never forget her and i never did . stanley rosenfeld does not forget .
well , thanks for your help mr. rosenfeld and i 'm sorry my mother would n't go out with you , i 'm sure she would have had a really great time .
no it does n't but ... i ... i wish it did .
he 'll remember my mother for sure . stanley it was a big class vada and ... but ... well of course he 'll remember , who could forget maggie ?
everybody did , walk along citrus between fountain and sunset any afternoon .
do you know him ?
he is ?
he 's a great poet .
beidermeyer that 's it , what a mad man .
beidermeyer ?
who did n't ? she could play basketball like jerry west , she danced like sid cherice , then she 'd look at you with those big blue eyes , forget about it . i asked her out a couple of times but she always said no .
really ?
no , i got ta go to the cemetery , keep your head up . do n't look at the ball , look at me .
wan na play ?
i like to buy off all the railroads .
once you put the hotels on board walk and park place he puts a shoe in your way .

i 've been living in it for over a year , the camper is mine .
you told everybody where you were going , i 'm here for the motor home .

sweetheart , did they bring mr. layton to your house today ?
that ca n't be , i have all the classic symptoms .
you are perfectly healthy .
i 'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people . but life is n't just death harry , do n't ignore the living , especially your daughter .
yeah , and when those suppers are disrupted because there 's a car crash , or there 's a fire , or a little boy steps on a beehive .
stop hiding harry , you run harry . when i first came here , the idea of working with dead people , did n't exactly thrill me , but when i saw a family lived here , i thought , & quot ; if i 'm living without a family , at least i can work with one , and maybe once in a while i 'll be invited in for supper. & quot ;
i know that , but what do you want from me ?
open your eyes , she 's eleven years old ! her only friend in the world is dead .
i do n't know which ball 's mine .
perfect .
watch you do n't knock out a fish .
i would never marry anybody i did n't love .
did you ahh , love him ?
pointing upwards look ...
yep , there they are ... they always look the same every year ...
you can get the general idea ...
can we see it from the back yard ?
is it really your camper ?
well , you were pretty great !

danny that 's a real _bonehead_ thing to say !

do you want to ?
old spice , phil says it 's a timeless classic .
what are you wearing ?
at widdman high i was considered a pretty hot date , i did a killer frugue .
see , you 're not that out of touch . you 're good .
rock ?
in ages , i know , me neither .
i have n't danced in ... ..
is there enough room ?
this is where we are .
here ?
dance with me ?
i brought the baby into the room a couple of times , she opened her eyes , yeah , yeah i think she saw vada . it was ... ..
did she ever see vada ?
ahh , complications during child birth , she died two days after vada was born .
what happened to her ?
oh , that was phil , trying to give me advice on dating 70 's women . look i 'm so out of touch , i have n't dated women in ages , not since my wife died .
i do n't know , tonight you just seemed a little cool , not opening car doors and ...
no , why ?
are you mad at me ?
yeah .
you can look in the bathroom if you want . people are always curious about that , like what happens when you flush .
well it certainly looks bigger that it seems .
i did it myself . i read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces .
it 's nice .
home sweet home .
okay , sure .
would you like to come in and see my house ? just for a minute .
i have n't had a bingo partner in ages .
i had a good time tonight .
you can be in a room with 100 men , and not like any of them , or you can be in a room with just one man , and he 's exactly the one you want .
oh , how do you mean ?
kinda like men .
look , it 's not always luck , i mean , depending upon the placement of the numbers , a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100 .
oh , i 'm just not lucky harry .
why d'you think these seats were empty .
i 'm gon na be putting makeup on some of these people very soon .
what 's that ?
i just had a terrible thought harry .
no . just , more activity .
does it make it easier to win ?
okay .
i do enjoy playing bingo , if you 'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you 're welcome to .
i love going to movies , especially at the drive in . i do n't think there 's anything more romantic than going to the drive in . i 'll let you get back to work .
i have n't been to the movies in ages .
you have to learn how to take a complement . movies , movies , ahhhh , & quot ; love story & quot ; at the drive in , i cried my eyes out , did you see it ?
it 's no big deal .
in lieu ... & quot ; instead & quot ; ... . no contest .
i prefer it to & quot ; instead & quot ; , it has more dignity .
oh it 's good , & quot ; in lieu of & quot ; i love that word lieu .
no kidding ?
i wrote that .
oh right , right , . bader lorenzo died june 22 1972 devoted husband to nicolette . cherished father of babritzio and heidi , in lieu of flowers , please send donations to the holy names society .
oh , i 'm just typing up a funeral notice , you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually , it 's a service we provide for the family .
nothing , i was just wondering what you were doing .
oh hi , what can i do for you ?
hi .
i 'm sure she will .
after my wife died , grammoo moved in here to help take care of vada . they were very close , but lately as her mind 's been wandering more and more , vada 's been acting kinda crazy . i 'm sure she 'll snap out of it though .
i should n't stick my nose in other people 's business . it 's just that i like vada , very much .
thanks , listen i wan na apologize for the other day downstairs , about vada , i was a little harsh .
excuse me harry , i 'm sorry , i just wan na let you know that the flowers were delivered . and the room 's all set up .
can not do without , harry 's wild about me .
she 's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl , look , do n't give me any advice about my daughter , okay ?
harry , i really think she ... ..
she was raised in a funeral home , she knows a thing or two about it .
i do n't think so , i think she 's confused about death .
oh that , she just likes to play .
well the other night at dinner ...
what do you mean ? ?
harry ? i was just wondering , if there is anything wrong with vada .
that was n't an image . she was an old school marm . fix it .
i just wanted to get past this & quot ; old school marm & quot ; image .
she did . this photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive .
i think she looks nice ! her lips are very thin so i used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality , and her eyes just needed a little definition , and her hair , i 'm sorry , nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972 .
this was the reverend porter 's wife , you have her looking like a two dollar hooker .
you do n't like it ?
yeah .
could you take a look at mrs. porter ?
uh huh ?
i promise i 'll take good care of these people , they deserve it , they 're dead , all they 've got left is their looks .
great , you can start right away . call me harry . now , umm , is this what you 'd normally wear for work ? do n't get me wrong , i like it , very much , but the ... .
okay mr. sultenfuss , you got a deal .
you 'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone .
ohh , oh sure it 's no big deal , you see all my former clients will eventually die , and all your clients used to be alive , so they have something in common .
oh , you still want it ? even though uhh ...
i need the job .
pardon ?
excuse me , what about the job ?
the add just said & quot ; makeup artist & quot ;
deceased .
stiffs ? ?
yes they are .
they 're dead ?
uhh , miss devoto , these people are already at ease . this is not a beauty parlor , it 's a funeral parlor .
i have a wonderful disposition , i put people right at ease .
uhh , miss devoto ...
i 'm a licensed cosmetologist , i worked for two years , at the & quot ; dino raphael & quot ; salon , all my customers cried when i told them i was leaving .
i think it 's still available .
it 's still available i hope ?
that 's good , memories are good sweetheart . vada , i 'm sorry ; i was trying to keep it from you , i just could n't . you 're a good girl , and i want you to be happy ; do n't be an old grump like me . seeya in the morning .
i think every time i see a climbing tree i 'll think of thomas j .
yes , i did , very much for a long time , and even now , i get a little sad when i think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked .
do you miss her ?
uh huh . you know what your mother did when she found out she was gon na have you ? she came home and painted this whole room pink . she was so sure she was gon na have a little girl .
really ?
she was pretty , and kind , she had your eyes . oh boy did she love to laugh . sometimes when you laugh , you sound just like her .
what was my mama like ?
ahh , that little chevy was your mothers favorite car .
in the garage .
i forgot about that picture , where did you find it ?
i found this .
no , no .
the bees killed thomas j , and i killed my mother .

there were just too many of 'em .
he 's okay is n't he ?
he was allergic to bees .
why not ?
no sweetheart , you ca n't .
maybe i should go over and yell at him .
i told him not to tease those bees . did he get stung ?
vada , something happened to thomas j last night , he stepped on a beehive .
he 's getting big . vada , come here and sit down for a minute .
yes .

yes she is , but she 's very upset , so she 's not seeing anyone .
hi , is vada home ?
hi .
weeping willow with your tears running down , why do you always weep and frown , is it because he left you one day , is it because he could not stay , on your branches he would swing , do you long for the happiness that they would bring , he found shelter in your shade , he thought his laughter would never fade , weeping willow stop your tears , there is something to calm your fears , you think death as if you forever part , but i know he 'll always be in your heart .
we 'd love to hear it .

i think it should be outlawed .
it 's actually a very beautiful thing , and look there would n't have been a vada .
my mommy and daddy did that ?
it 's okay , come on upstairs , we have to have a little talk .
i 'm eleven and a half .
how old are you ?
i do n't want , i do n't need your help ... .
what do you mean you 're hemorrhaging ?
i 'm hemorrhaging .
well he just left , what 's wrong ?
where 's daddy ?
vada , vada , what 's the matter ?
daddy ? ? ! ? ! ? !
yes ! !
no !
no ! , he 's fine . fish are very resilient animals you know . do n't worry , i wo n't get another fish .
vada ? would you like us to get you another goldfish ?
oh great ! !
i won , i won ! ! !
well , i 'm no doctor . all i know is , the next day they had really high fevers , and their faces got very fat . they baffled medical science , they were in a magazine .
nephritis ? it 's a kidney disease , you do n't get it from hot dogs .
i do n't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach . you know vada you have to watch what you eat here , i remember one time i went to a carnival with my cousins david and frank , and they both ate hot dogs , and the next day they came down with nephritis .
are you here to take shelly back ?
this is danny and ralph , they own the dino raphael salon in detroit . we used to be married .
i like my name .
see food !
uh huh , why ?
hey shelly , like seafood ?
hi .
hey , i thought i recognized you two , hi vada .
aarrggh .
ssshhhhh , i do n't want them to see me .
uh huh , i 've been trying to get out to hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars , i have n't gotten there yet . all right , open your eyes .
do you like putting makeup on people ?
they 'll come around . close your eyes , i wan na bring out the gorgeous color in them . the first rule in applying eye makeup , is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow .
the boys at school do n't think i am .
yes , vada i think you 're very pretty . you 've got these great big sparkling eyes , the cutest little nose , an amazing mouth .
shelly , do you think i 'm pretty ?
come here , sit down .
no .
have you ever tried any ?
i think lipstick looks fake , no-ones lips are that color .
a girl 's always got ta look her best .
so how come you 're putting lipstick on ?
no .
are you going out somewhere ?
okay .
you do n't have to wait , daddy 'll be mad if you 're late .
sure .
can i use your bathroom first ?
bye . well miss vada , what d'you say we head back ?
well , sometimes married people just find out they ca n't live with each other .
daddy said it 's bad when people get divorced .
no , i 'm divorced .
are you married ?
mostly love , and romance .
what are they about ?
uh huh .
did you read all these books ?

i think you 'd make a fine writer , did you ask your dad ?
shut your big fat mouth !
i do n't think so . shelly , how can i get thirty five dollars ?
maybe black means you 're happy ?
it 's a mood ring , it tells what mood i 'm in .
ooh , that 's a pretty ring you 're wearing .
chocolate ?
he 's allergic to everything .
i 'm not upset . i will never play with those girls . i only surround myself with people who i find intellectually stimulating .
you know vada , you should n't let those girls upset you .
i am .
who 's winning ?
oh .
she 's shy .
that 's really cool .
yes it is .
is that your camper ?
hey there 's your dad and shelly .
oh great !
nothing in particular , just putting it away for a rainy day .
what are you saving for ?
well , i guess you found my secret hiding place .
they 're just fun to read .
eeeeuuuww , gross .
liverpool ?
i 'm gon na drive us to liverpool .
uh huh .
wow , this is the coolest thing , like you really eat and sleep here ?
to chocolate ?
i 'm allergic to it .
thomas j ?
well if you do n't get to marry mr. bixler .
for what ?
would you think of me ?
what ?
okay , seeya . vada ?
seeya tomorrow .
okay .
well , let 's spit on it .
you better not either .
just , hurry .
umm , ummmmm
say something it 's too quiet .
okay on the count of three .
okay , okay .
just do it .
but then i wo n't be able to see anything .
close your eyes .
uh huh . okay , enough practice .
like this ?
here , practice on your arm like this .
but , i do n't know how .
maybe we should , just to see what 's the big deal .
no .
uh huh .
like they do on tv ?
have you ever kissed anyone ?
not true .
yes it is , cause then he 'll give you all a 's and it wo n't be fair .
it is not .
you ca n't marry a teacher , it 's against the law .
i 'm gon na marry mr. bixler .
well when you get older , you just have to .
please , it 's real hot , maybe we can go swimming ?
i dunno..
hi vada , can you come out ?
oh , that 's probably thomas j , i do n't wan na see him . it 's not fair . nothing happens to boys .
okay , seeya .
no , i 'm hiding out .
you can come to my house for dinner ?
leave then , some friend you are .
i have to anyway , my mom will be worried .
then go home , baby .
i 'm hungry , i ca n't last any longer .
he likes her better than me .
i do , she 's real funny .
i do n't like her .
so now you 'll have a mother .
they 're getting married ?
you 're such a retard , it was an engagement ring .
wow , was it a decoder ring ?
my dad gave shelly a ring .
why are you running away ?
i 'm tired of running away . besides , we past this place two times already . we 're not getting nowhere .
get up ! ?
really ?
no , you ca n't , they have enough kids , you 'll have to live with the partridge family .
i wan na live with them too .
california , i 'm going to hollywood to live with the brady bunch .
bye ma .
bye mrs. sennett .
come on , let 's go .
sure .
hi , wan na ride bikes ?
hi vada .
do it !
but i have my clothes on !
jump in the water ! !
hurry ! ! !
i am running faster ! !
run faster they 're after us ! !
my mood ring ! it fell off ! i got ta find it !
got it !
for their meat .
what do you want it for anyway ?
you 're right , let 's knock it down .
are you crazy , you 'll get stung ! !
stand back .
so ?
pointing there 's a beehive right there !
what ?
woah ! !
hey you ! ! ! ! i 'm gon na get you ! ! ! i 'll get you ! ! ! !
this ! !
what ?
hey vada , guess what we got ?
you know i 'm not allowed outside my myself after dark .
go ? ? ?
can we go yet ?
duck !
watch bingo ? i do n't even like to play bingo .
we 're not gon na bet , we 're just gon na watch .
they 're not gon na let us in vada , we 're kids .
i stopped that !
bed wetter !
i am not .
pacifist !
i told you i 'll get in trouble .
let 's go to the church , they 're playing bingo tonight .
what do you want ? my mom will skin me alive if she finds i 'm out here .
sorry .
do n't do that ! !
here .
that does n't sound so bad , come on , we 'll never find that streamer .
it does n't matter , 'cause they 're not regular horses , they got wings , and it 's no big deal if you fall , you just land in cloud .
but , what if you 're afraid to ride horses ?
i think , everybody gets their own white horse , and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day , and everybody 's best friends with everybody else , when you play sports , there 's no teams , so nobody gets picked last .
heaven .
what ?
what do you think it 's like ?
no . grammoo said she 's in heaven .
do you remember her ?
it 's my mother .
who 's that with your dad ?
yes .
is that your dad ?
never mind .
hey , where does it say that ?
you have no personality .
what ?
hmmmm , interesting .
come on , it 's fun .
no , i do n't wan na .
that was grammoo 's . it 's a phrenology chart , they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not . come here , i 'll diagnose your head .
hey look at this !
oh , in the garage . walk me over .
where 's your bike ?
a girl can never wear enough eye shadow .
what 's wrong with your eyes ?
no .
your lip bleeding ?
okay , ow !
uh huh .
if i do it , can we go ?
it 'll bleed .
it 's a mosquito bite .
you could pick that scab on your arm .
naah , i do n't wan na .
hey , we can become blood brothers .
yeah he got away . come on let 's go .
i do n't like touching fish , how do you pull the hook out without touching it ?
reel it in . he 's only tiny , throw him back .
i 'm trying .
hurry !
oh no ! uuh .
big deal , i can do that too . thomas j , you got something !
i 'm gon na be an acrobat when i grow up .
maybe they had a big breakfast .
she only wants to do it because her sweetie pie 's the teacher .
it 's not a real school , it 's a writing class , i wan na be a writer .
she 's crazy , she wants to go to school over the summer .
it 's only black when you 're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood .
it does n't work , it always stays black .
dinner time ? ? you 're like a dog ! you just go home to eat .
why ? it 's not dinner time yet .
no , i 'm going home .
hi mr. bixler !
i do n't wan na talk to a teacher , it 's summer !
that 's mr. bixler , let 's go talk to him .
at what ?
oh wow , a real evil canieval .
hey look at this , no feet !
i ca n't , i have to go home .
i knew he would n't come .
part of being a new yorker .
you do n't miss much .
i 'll call george 's parents . tell them i need a best man who actually looks after me .
i honestly wish i could ...
stay , huh ?
i 'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective .
what ?
well , i 'm close to her . i wanted to meet the one that got away .
long trip . pretty nice of you to come .
something like that .
and i 'm supposed to respect your fashion tips , because you 're what , a new yorker ?
you should look like you dressed yourself .
i should look different .
... trouser width , this is all classic . which means safe , something i 'd wear .
well , then , i 'll take it up with her .
yeah , it 's in the contract .
oh , you 're more than okay .
i 'll think about it . i 'm okay .
good girl .
i did what i came to do .
hey , handsome . brevity this ...
digger and george are with family in the hamptons until monday morning . brevity is even more in order than usual .
and what will he do ?
tell him you know this is the worst , dumbest , cruelest moment to do this to him . but there it is , and he has to choose .
to belong to someone .
needing .
tell him you 're afraid of love . afraid of needing .
i 'm moving this book to viking .
tell him you 've loved him for nine years , but you were afraid to realize it .
i 'm taking my next book to viking .
tell him you love him . with all your heart .
you 're going to say it , are n't you ?
manicure ...
major . dish .
two words .
it 's too late to start over .
i suppose it 's too late to start over .
what do you suggest ?
how do you know you can touch that plug ? are you a licensed contractor ?
i ca n't even say it .
i give .
do n't be ridiculous , we 're having a serious conversation !
elmer 's glue ?
that was thursday .
ben gay .
try less appropriate .
neosporin ?
i wish .
zit cream ?
i know that ! i was distracted by grief !
jesus . you 're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m ...
let 's not get carried away .
someday she 'll thank you .
beyond reason . the feminist warrior will rise up in this kid , and she 'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife , selecting from a short list of body parts !
the man you love .
i am breaking her heart in the short run , but doing her a gigantic favor ! she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus !
impressive .
i do n't know the meaning of the word guilt !
it 's not his happiness you 're feeling guilty about ...
he was in love with me every day for nine years . i can make him happier than she can .
sure .
and you believe that .
this is my whole life 's happiness . i have to be ruthless .
... and having `` done the right thing '' will only really be comforting , oh , maybe , five , six times .
you 've been working on this , huh ?
there are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years ...
because i realized . when i see him say `` i do , '' that knife will be in my heart . and it will be there every ...
go figure you .
i was devastated .
if i did n't have to hate her , i 'd adore her .
you like her .
what i mean , when i say annoyingly perfect , is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection . it is vulnerable and endearing . and that is annoying as shit .
you 're butting in .
i noticed . i 'm on the noon back . we have this thing with george 's family in the hamptons .
you flew all the way h ...
when i 'm talking to children .
chill ? since when do you say ch ...
chill . we do n't want your face coming off with it .
she knows him maybe five seconds , plus she has billions of dollars , plus she 's perfect , so do n't go feeling sorry for miss pre-teen illinois !
i can see why .
he 's adored me for nine goddamn years .
it 's called the law of love , asshole .
you have a real philosophy of life .
same difference . if you love someone , it 's your duty to save them from themselves .
no , he 's ruining yours .
you have no appropriate sense of emergency . my best friend is ruining his life .
i 'll have to kill myself before i call him .
i have a suggestion ...
we 'll never be the same .
we 're about to find out .
he ca n't do that to me !
then why are you compulsively eating ? if you 're not hysterical ?
he 's not proposing marriage , there 's no way i 'm buying one word of th ...
desperate . to talk .
you think ...
he says , `` swear . when we 're both 28 , if we 've never been married ... we marry each other ! ''
blood oath .
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me ...
i 've lost interest .
solid and genuine is not boring . michael can be completely insane ...
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am , he always makes me sound boring .
he 's still in love with you .
he 's the salt of the earth . kind and loyal and generous . the one constant thing in my life , is he 'll always be there .
no , he 's nothing like me . he 's like you . only straight .
kindred spirits .
nine years , we 've seen each other through everything . losing jobs , losing parents , losing lovers ... travelled all over , we 've had the best times . the best times of my life , maybe . just drinking and talking . even over a phone .
the wandering sportswriter .
no , no , the opposite . that 's my best friend , michael o'neal . he sounds desperate to talk .
... weeks .
sometimes i do . like for two months .
... i do n't send you men , anymore . you do n't know what to do with them .
is newsday a real interview , or just some cute guy you 're setting me up w ...
needs salt .
plus some guys whose food i do n't like .
which is everyone you could n't get in .
see the pull of a book like twenty chefs , is not who i put in . it 's who i leave out .
i 've adjusted , and thanks for asking .
is it sad to be an editor , and bask only in reflected insincerity ?
if your ass is n't chapped , you are not a good-writer of note .
is it ever embarrassing , having your bum kissed in public ?
that 's entirely understandable .
i never want to go through this again .
have you ever heard of . irony ?
why do n't you just drive a stake through my heart ?
in one minute . you are going to feel so foolish .
i love him .
yeah , well , lots of couples are imcompat ...
... that this is all my fault ?
if you 're waiting for `` do you take this man ? `` , that 's considered poor form .
do n't you see ...
when are you gon na come clean with your folks ?
what with the psychosis and all , yeah .
this must be ... very , very , hard on him .
who ? the jerk who 's running your life ?
they 'll eat it anyway , you ever been to a walk ?
look at all this beautiful food , so lovingly prepared ...
we settled this . and i reneged . that was n't fair .
uh , kimmy ... ?
i just do n't want to freak him out .
your call . you can live a lie . in a fabulous selection of red roof inns . or you can make one desperate stab at hap ...
he wo n't get mad , huh ?
in six months , he 'll be happy , settled , successful ...
only . if he wants to .
he 'll see right through it .
what you said . make it appear that he 's doing you the favor .
exactly what ?
exactly .
so ... one almost has to ...
hello .
gold dog collars ? they do n't have dogs .
gold nose hair clippers .
for the twins ? what in the world is th ...
... whatever is manly and independent .
but he always says ...
bad games , bad towns , bad pay , bad flights , bad hotels , real bad food . homeless , rootless , lonely , maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four ...
i mean , he loves his job .
probably am . forget i brought it up .
i just think you 're wrong , is all .
oh , that . i forgot i even said th ...
about michael 's job .
... best valley in new zealand , best ... women 's shoes ...
stop , we 're embarrassing h ...
... always . the best dim sum , the best camping stuff ...
it 's not just clubs . this guy always knows the best everything . the best guitar store , the best beef ribs , the best horowitz record , was he always like the ...
no , this happened to me once , almost , it was excruciating !
ju ...
jesus , we 're trapped !
he has you on a pedestal . and me in his arms .
i 've missed a step .
you 're enshrined in his heart and memory . unassailable . which works out great .
you win .
i was gon na predict that .
and the answer was so simple .
no .
i 'm not joking . i had to face up to all my competitive drives , and believe me , i 've got 'em .
well , perfection can get wearing after whi ...
you 'll always be there . in his mind . the perfect creature he loved for all those y ...
... except one .
do you get hysterical in small confined spa ...
but nothing ever could , ever did , give me a moment 's pause about this marriage ...
let me rephrase that ...
so it 's sweet of you to be protective ...
do you get nervous in small confined spaces ?
and loving him means loving all of this .
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults , i made a command decision that changed my life .
it 's been awhile . i 'll take your word .
but he sure can kiss .
a trademark move , do n't touch it .
he sucks soup through his front teeth .
... cigars in bed ? i broke him on that . but the bathroom 's a swamp , he wears reeboks to dinner , tells the same , admittedly funny , jokes three hundred times ...
how about ...
... his snoring , yeah . he says it 's worse than ever . that snaffle one ... ?
well . you 've been introduced to the symphonic range of ...
... garden sports , all . little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit , represents a packing challenge , but there 's fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit ...
it depends . if san antonio sweeps sacramento , we could start there . or phoenix . or depending on indiana- clevel ...
so your honeymoon is exactly where ?
i 'm excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot , he 's only there a ye ...
... most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding . just to top it off .
what ? because i 'm a little understand ...
... luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere , is all i 'm s ...
... just my bridal shower . and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one-thirty game .
do n't you have to be somewh ...
he said that , too .
that 's why michael and i were the wrong fit . right from the start .
... you hate weddings , you never go .
what else did he tell you ...
not you . you wo n't be comfortable unless you 're distinctive .
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress .
the twin part . i like to remain impartial in my contempt .
which was the disqualifying factor ?
the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty . identical twin debutantes from nashville , who are basically vengeful sluts . with amazing bodies !
uh . how about promoting a bridesmaid ? someone you know for at least forty-five minutes .
you ca n't believe what it 'd cost to bring in a temp .
... you want a menage on your wedding night .
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav ...
see . dry . it 's in the delivery .
can you watch the road ?
but i ca n't be dry .
i can be quick . i can even be funny .
excuse me ?
you need a few dollars .
my heart 's in my throat , here . right off , i have to ask this monstrous favor ...
i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you .
well , we 're ...
all i 've heard , from the day i met michael , is julianne this , and julianne that ...
you are < u < so right . what a nerve on that guy ! bring my dress to church , huh ?
i had this crank call ? from some guy who thinks he saw her ? i said , what would a bride be doin ' , on her wedding ...
ex-cuse me ?
oh , she 's slipped out , the little monkey . prob'ly with michael , doin ' the nasty .
it 's jules , you guys have n't had a call from , say , kimberly , have you ?
wallace egregious residence , mandy speaking .
... well , maybe it works on fingers , too .
i saw the show .
right . and then it did n't want to come off . exactly .
... look good on kimberly .
well . see . that was a ... reflex to see if it would ...
... unless he has a hump .
have you sized up the groomsmen , jules ? as m. of h. , you get first fuck . do n't pick the short , hairy , rich one .
i need to make some calls . could i use ... your office ?
well , you 're a little early ...
nobody has . so far .
i have n't caused ... a problem , have i ?
i told him , get the important stuff , kim 's ring . i 'll collect the inconsequentials .
i thought michael was picking me up .
then it could all come out , sooner or later . nobody should be in on this . just you and me . or , more correctly , i .
maybe . i should call ben .
he 's too proud to beg for help . and if you wait till this comes out , your offer will be like charity . completely humiliating .
and you think he 's kept this to himself .
he 's said some things over the past few weeks . look , this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job .
it does n't say th ...
i think he 's been fired .
i know ben .
it 's a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson , michael 's boss .
sir , this is important ! have n't you ever in your life cut one corner , to make something important turn out right ?
julianne , reading my son-in-law 's mail , is not something ...
i hope so . this is all too mysterious to waste on just me .
is anybody watching ?
i think you 're making a mistake , sir .
they both have some growing up to do . but they 're good people , they 're starting with love . they 've got time .
nice meeting you , too , walt .
under the circumstances . charmed to know you , jules .
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question .
if he gives you grief , i 'll have him skillfully beaten , where the wounds wo n't show .
... me , yeah . and she likes tommy lasorda . case closed .
the kiss . may be hard . for you to explain . because the only fear she really has , is ...
if you find her ...
okay , we 'll split up . you go to every romantic place you guys have , i 'll go ... someplace brilliant , and the first one who ...
that 's little egotistical .
i 'm just thinking of how she 's hurting . lost . alone . like her life is over .
course , if it 's later rather than sooner , i 'd hate to be you at six o'clock . you 've got a lot of explaining to ...
you ca n't believe you 've lost her ! sooner or later , you 'll find her , and you 'll look in each other 's eyes , and you 'll see all that love ...
that is so romantic .
almost three .
it 's two weeks .
i never forgot that .
this is where i proposed .
why would she come here ...
i came here , looking for her .
i 'm so glad you did n't jump on that train , before ...
the pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus .
lower .
lower .
actually . lower . i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum . lower . the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung ...
i did n't know it would get sent . i just wanted you to ... get mad at kimmy ... and ...
i mean , do you realize what you 've ... well , of course you realize , that 's why you 're confessing , i mean ... i mean ... how could you do that ?
are you crazy ?
... wrote it , yeah . i 'm the bad guy .
you 're not saying you actually ... you 're saying that y ...
do n't speak !
uh . i saw that moving ...
this is the dumbest thing i will ever do . so dumb , in fact , that i ca n't . i do n't think .
jules , what 's wrong ...
shhh .
what 's up ?
nellie fox . walter likes the past . and he likes the little guys .
the big hurt , huh ?
you never want to do that , see , that 's always a ... costly turnover . as they say in the sport biz .
... yeah , that .
... your one chance for true happiness ?
well , it happens .
i was so confused , so conflicted , so ... unstable .
oh , yeah .
thank god you were here .
love does n't have to be right . it just has to be love .
does that make it right ...
she admits it 's her fault .
i asked you ...
because she 's as chickenshit as you are , you morons are made for each other .
well . how come she did n't ...
and your point ?
this is her family and her fault .
get married , apparently .
she has n't told anybody , what am i supposed to do ?
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good , you decided to stay for brunch !
look , i came down here to face everybody . i did n't want to slink away like some coward ...
i had the craziest dream last night ? walter and kimmy had asked your boss to ...
if san antonio sweeps sacramento ...
or we 'll go somewhere . if you have the time .
i just want to be alone . is that okay ?
should we take a walk ? or maybe some food sent up , or something ...
the job thing would have broken us up , eventually , anyway . she could n't have lived with it . i know that now .
maybe tomorrow , you 'll feel dif ...
no , it 's for the best , it really is . we were so wrong for each other .
michael ...
a bad combination .
she denied it . said i was crazy and paranoid .
it 's over .
what happened ?
`` maybe you should take the job . and dump the girl . ''
i 'm just tired . please put her on ? thanks .
`` mike , the funny thing is , he 's offering you a gig you 'd be stupid to turn down ... ''
isabelle ? i need to talk to kim ...
mike . i ca n't believe i 'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding . but i think you need and deserve to know ...
michael ? what ha ...
... maybe it 's congratulations .
the fax is from ben , too . man , it 's my wedding , and my boss ca n't leave me alone ...
it means a lot .
this thing means that much to y ...
you 're right . easy come , easy go .
listen up , huh ? even if you blow this deal , how big could it be ?
tomorrow is sunday . nobody 's doing business . crack of dawn , monday , walter 'll take you up there ...
we could use ... his computer , to ... just e-mail those suckers right ou ...
it 's just ... up there ... right in front of walter 's ... y'know , computer . if memory serves .
i forgot how cute you look . when you get impossible .

we danced to it . just like this .
so we heard it ... like , right that ... that first ...
the night we met .
where did we first hear th ...
i 'll check . i have it on powerbook , these days .
dance card filled ?
i mean , you commit to a wedding . and then it seems like ... this ... momentum , you know ? you forget you ... chose it .
i would n't know . i never had that many first thoughts .
me either .
i can hardly wait for your wedding .
except for that .
except for the hot affairs we 'll have twice a year .
and i was thinking this could be our last time . alone . together . you know ?
you 've been the man in mine .
you 've sort of been ... y'know , the woman in my life .
it 's more than that .
well . there 's a lot of memories to choose from ...
have you .
i 've been thinking a lot the last couple days . about us , actually .
if you like .
do n't you throw up on boat ?
no . i 've got you .
you miss her , huh ?
well , you 've got the rest of your lives .
kim has all this stuff to do , i hardly see her .
you keep saying that .
big weddings are so strange .
like i said , dazzling .
you guys are heartless , my bride picked this out .
does it , really ? how come you never took some sell-out establishment job ? you had plenty of chances !
michael , it sounds like a wonderful opportun ...
no problem . a little bullshit about daddy 's `` needs , '' and presto , i 'm a lap dog in high society .
michael ! !
why do n't you start being honest for one fucking sec ...
never can tell .
wow and wow . you have a date , after this ?
you need a baby-sitter . that 's what i 'm here for .
it 's weird being the groom . all these things kimmy has to take care of ...
boy , those were the days .
last zoo we were in was ... beijing , yeah ? sure . the rhinos were fucking .
i switched that around when you were n't looking .
you never eat when you 're despondent .
i never eat when i 'm serene .
you 're not eating .
that would be a girl . i do n't even know .
still . all 's fair in love and w ...
i got the point .
i guess you 're right . that would be deceitful ... manipulative ... controlling ... emascula ...
she would never . never . even think of that .
i mean walter owns the sox , cable sports ... most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t ...
... all of it . she 's leaving her family , her friends , everything she knows . she 's putting her career on hold , and she seems a pretty ambitious , driven , kind of pers ...

at first , i thought it was a gag , but she 's always done it !
quite the little eccentric .
every day . she makes the bed .
my very point . here 's another one ...
endearingly absent-minded .
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up , she forgets and puts it down .
what 's next ?
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust ?
hate that .
she 's too genuine .
such as .
luckily . the closer i watched , the more the fault came into focus . each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability .
... see , that 's what i thought at first . how can you like someone that perfect ? no potential for long-range livability .
i just admire your maturity , that 's all . i mean , there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring . day after day , year after year ...
dance ? you do n't dance ! you learn to dance ? ?
best everything , joe . but i 'm going to dance with you .

and she 's all wrong for me !
you do n't understand . i 've never felt this way about anybody !
well , that 's great . you have n't really had anybody since dingbat jennylee ...
yeh , well my old machine kept eating messages . i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement , but finally ...
i 've been calling for days !

damn straight , it 's how i feel ! what 's their wedding gift , a little gold collar that says `` mikey-poo '' ? or do i have to change my name to `` binky '' ?

what a sweet little picture . mommy and daddy are n't losing a daughter , they 're gaining a eunuch !
and what am i supposed to do with my life , huh ? i am 28 years old ! i work in a low-paying , low-status , zero-respect job which , unfortunately , i happen to fucking love . how inconvenient .
what is that sup ...
i 'm sure glad i 'm hearing all this now , before it 's too late !
well , forgive me for screwing up your plans !
all of a sudden , i 'm supposed to drop out of school , forget my family , forget my career , forget all the plans i had for my life ...
... and you knew about this .
and to m ...
to him .
it would only be , maybe , six months ? or three or four ? it would mean so much to him ...
like family , huh ?
he needs someone incredible , someone really close , who he can trust ...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him .
he never mentioned that . neither did y ...
no , it 's , uh ... a real big favor .
it 's not just a gag , huh ?
to the twins ' soiree ? so they can paw you and drool ... ?
because i could come ...
the most important thing . is being together .
i travel every week . college ball , motor sports , training camps ...
well , the school will be here . architecture will still be around . right now ...
you 're much more his type .
personally , i think mr. michael 's marrying the wrong girl .
an so it is .
he said you told him . it 'd be safer with you .
oh the way out of the crab house ? we asked michael if we could see the ring ?
maybe it 's happy there .
with those big , dark , haunted eyes . as if you were harborin ' some ... unspeakably ... guilty ... secret .
and yet here you are . all celibate and reclusive .
this is usda prime , largely available , beef . with no notice- able competition , present company excepted ...

nose tackle from the bears ... power forward from the bulls ... defenseman from the black hawks ... my personal favorite , the designated hitter ...
kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas , so we figured , give 'em a cheap thrill . walter supplied the decorative touches ...

oh just about everything , i guess . those doctors started on an overhaul and do n't want to quit . they keep taking things out . she 's going to come home an egg shell . tough , though.. she 's tough .
what 's wrong with her .
eater says she does n't see how you do it .
i said , i 've been real tired .
you 'll have to speak up .
well , i guess you caught me at a weak moment .
well , my wife , ester 's down the hall . i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here . she loves you so much , i just had to come down and say hello . we 've been following you since you were a girl . well , i just scared you to death . i did n't mean to do that .
how did you come in here ?
oh , honey , i did n't mean to scare you .
i 'm really all right , barnett . do n't you worry really ... i just do n't want you to leave me that 's all .
am i disturbing you ?

no , you do n't , so do n't say you do . bunch of damn liars . what do you get out or this ?

that 's pretty close . he 's going to be on the bill . why not put barbara jean on with him ?
his word ? are you telling me haven promised you something ?
his word .
whose word ?
everybody likes to be as good as their word .
how is that ?
well , it 's probably because it would help him .
he knows better .
i guess that 's why he thought you right want to help out .
haven ? hell , ' we 've been playing poker together since we were fourteen .
well , that 's not entirely true , barnett . at least not according to haven .

i 'm not really a musician .
when you run out or money , 'cause you will here , you can go sing at bishop 's pub . they let you pass the hat . all these kids do that . most every place does n't want to bother with you .
oh ... a little of both . just thought i 'd look around at nashville for a while .
my wife and i think so , but we 're family . your family 's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family . what do you do , pick or sing ?
she sure sings nice .
i did n't think it would . she 's calling herself l.a. joan this- week . last week it was dakota . guess if you have to change your name a state 's as good as anything .
i think we can do that . come in .
yes , sir . i need a room
can i help you ?
yes , sir .
that tom sure is cute .
maybe you can look after me a little .
but not unless nashville really inspires me .
i see ... well , those doctors are real miracle workers .
i said , maybe i 'll change my name again .
what did you say ?
well , i could use one , especially if i 'm pregnant .
did an exploratory and according to them , she needed an overhaul .
all they got is advertisements . just like l.a .
it 's hard to say . doctors thought she 'd come home a week ago . all it was was appendix .
you know anything about the stations here ?
she 's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday .
uh huh .
i'1l get your bag .
he is just wonderful .
glad to see you . ester 'll be glad , too .

i do n't really know what you 're talking about .
i mean , mr. green was so nice to me . he took me in and ...
i 'm in a hurry , gon na see this great group record at woodland .

your hair fell out ? just like your father . weak hair .
does their hair fall out ?
weather 's been awful . all those bombs dropping . it changes our weather . sure not like the good old days .
how do you know if they do ?
well , you 'll get it , skin as sensitive as yours .
i do n't think so .
he doesn1t have fungus , does he ?
fungus ?
worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus .
no . no , they 're white . he 's got a nice dog .
bet the sheets are grey .
i do n't know his first name .
green ? not owen green . owen green embezzled money from your grandfather
i 'm in a rooming house with mr. green .

have your children been deaf since birth ?
i know . goodbye .
that 's what you said before .

hal ? well , hal and i have been friends for a long time .
what do you think of him ?
where is she ?
pleasure
sure thing .
you think it will ?
well , honey , i sure hope it comes your way then .
wade -- i 've been working toward this audition for years .
you serious ?
if you 're serious . being serious is real important .
you think i should take lessons ?
it 's not bad .
is that good ?
you sure do it loud .
you think i got any kind of a voice ?
no -- that 's exercises . my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched . every time you stretch them , the middle part sets stronger . that 's the place where i sing .
well , you just remember , if you ca n't kick front , kick back , 'cause at least you 're kicking ... ten minutes , okay ?
got me an audition tonight .
you bet .
you want a ride into town ?
now , sueleen , you know that 's not what we talked about right here in this very room .
do n't you think they 'd just love another song instead ?
i know that you are an artist and i am sure you are very religious .
i see .
now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself . the more you take off , you see , more money we can raise .
may i see your costume ?
oh , why thank you .
i 'm john triplette . excuse me . i got all caught up in looking at you . you 'll be fine .
hi , i 'm sueleen gay .
what ...
thank you . grace , there is one other thing ...
yes , you are .
that means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife . am i correct on that point ?
yes , they were .
point of fact , were n't tim 's hands registered as lethal weapons ?
yes , i would .
so , i think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that bruce lee , arguably the greatest martial artist of all times , developed for nine years , that would be a fella who could defend himself . would you describe tim that way , grace ?
that 's what tim said .
now , while i freely admit total ignorance on the subject , i have heard of bruce lee . and i was under the impression that bruce lee was one of the , if not < u > the < /u > greatest fighter in the history of martial arts .
yes , i did . that 's why tim studied it . because it was bruce lee 's fighting style .
jeet kune do ... now i did some research on that form of fighting , and i found out that jeet kune do was a style developed by bruce lee . did you know that ?
tim studied several styles , but his favorite was jeet kune do .
is that a fact ? well then , grace , could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that tim was schooled in ?
the style of fighting that tim studied did n't believe in belts .
what was the color of tim 's belt ?
yes you are .
when you study the martial arts , they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you 're at in your training . am i correct on that point ?
more or less ...
more or less .
no , but that do n't mean much . i was a completely different person ten years ago . let 's give key lime a day in court . and a large glass of milk .
when ya had it , did ya like it ?
i have n't had a key lime pie in ten years .
the key lime is great , but it 's an acquired taste .
which do you recommend ?
apple , pecan , cherry , and key lime .
what kind of pies do you have ?
well , back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad . and we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors . so , you kids out there , keep the faith . cause mickey and mallory will be comin ' to your town real soon .
how do you intend to disappear ? you 're probably the most famous couple in america .
well , now me and mickey are gon na take it easy . just enjoy each other 's company , stop and smell the roses , notice the color purple , stuff like that .
we had nothing to do with that riot . that riot was just -- whatchmacallit --
try to keep it to a minimum .
have n't you been listening to a fuckin ' word i said ? ... oh , i 'm sorry . can i say fuckin ' ? i ca n't , can i ?
did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room ?
i wondered how long it would be before we 'd get to be alone together . and i wondered if i could wait that long .
what did you think then ?
it was n't 'till we got on the ground floor that i totally realized they were n't gon na shoot unless we shot first . when we got out of the stairwell , i remember thinking , 'oh my god . this might work . ' but mickey knew it would work all along . there was n't any doubt in his mind . it 's not like there was and he just did n't show it . he knew it would work .
mallory , what did you think of mickey 's plan ? did you think it would work ?
i said we 'd give you an interview . i never said we would n't kill you .
looked like an interview to me .
what he said . we did n't know jack shit about and riot . it just happened . it was kismet . we did n't even know those people . how are we supposed to organize a riot when we 've been in fuckin ' isolation for the past year ? just bleep out the fucks and jack shits . i mean , it 's not like we care . if they wan na say we masterminded the whole thing , let 'em . it wo n't exactly keep us up at night . but you said you wanted the truth , and the truth is we were just lucky .
divine intervention .
we still got a few tricks up our sleeves .
has n't it ?
do n't stop !
mickey !
thanks . roll 'em , donut .
by all means , knock yourself out .
yeah .
you got something you want to do ?
are we in a big hurry ?
now , when we get out there , you do what we say or it 's curtains . if we say move , you move . if we say left , you move left . if we say right , you move right . if we say mole , you dig a hole . got it ?
grace . i 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother tim , if you feel up to it .
naw , she do n't mind .
now that you bring it up , yes . they were different men . i had n't really thought that much about it . since many psychiatric opinions are , by a rule , sought out for this kind of situation . what do you think normally happens ? the knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives ? the state does n't work like that .
i take it by your answer it was a whole new team ?
using the same doctors is not common practice .
were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them ?
the prison board and the doctors who examined them .
who is we ?
what 's changed , mr. gayle , is our minds . we felt they were competent a year ago . a year has passed , sir , a year where they were under close observation , day in and day out , and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong .
when they were found competent before , they had already killed fifty people . other than the fact they 're a disciplinary problem , which frankly should n't surprise anyone , i still do n't see where this situation is any different then it was before . so , i ask you again , mr. mcclusky , what 's changed ?
well , since that time , they 've killed one person during their trail . and since their incarceration , they 've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates .
mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial . i 'm confused . what 's changed ?
the prison board made the decision . a board of which i belong . we 're the who . the why is simple . mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care , where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need .
why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum ? and who made the decision ?
ai n't love grand .
because they would n't give them their blessing for marriage .
mickey 's better half herself . mallory knox . this little lady drowned her father in a fish tank .
who 's the song bird ?
you write the script jack , call it , 'showdown in mojave : the extermination of mickey and mallory ' , whatever ... have we found our man ?
i see .
you 're a breathing icon of justice and that 's why you were chosen to deliver mr. and mrs. knox . we , the prison board we , knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen , an escape attempt , an accident , fire , anything ... jack 'supercop ' scagnetti would be there to look out for his public 's best interests .
you 're a celebrated cop . twenty-six years on the force , a best-seller out on paperback ...
by all means .
the public loves you jack ... you do n't mind if i call you jack , do you ?
so , how do i fit into this scheme ?
you 've heard of it ?
lobotomy bay ?
so can we . so the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy . and we 're shippin ' 'em to nystrom asylum for the criminally insane .
i can appreciate that .
look , our situation in a nutshell is , no prison wants 'em , no prison will take 'em . i 'm even talkin ' hellholes , where the warden 's as hard as a bar of iron . no one wants those fuckin ' assholes behind their walls , dealin ' with 'em day in , day out .
five inmates , eight guards and one psychiatrist all in one year 's time ... very good . you do keep up with the headlines .
they 've killed a shitload of inmates and guards -- -
susanville , soledade .
they 've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries -- -
you been followin ' the news coverage ?
who is n't ?
dewight mcclusky of the california prison board . take a seat please .
thank you , sir .
congratulations on the curtis fox case , scagnetti . you put an end to a nightmare . the ladies of this city can get to sleep again , and they have you to thank .
okay , wayne , step forward .
yeah .
you 're taking us to that holding cell now . all right , cut !
she 's in the holding cell , on this floor .
okay , buddy boy , where ya keepin ' mallory ? i know she 's still here , and i know you know where . so , start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene .
what ?
did you ever see 'eldorado ? '
i 've never wounded anything in my life . i got you locked right between the eyes .
or what ? you 'll wound me ? i can blow you in half and you know it .
slide the shotgun over here , put your hands behind your head , put your forehead on the floor .
looks like we got a mexican standoff .
how 's it goin ' ?
... one night i was asleep , and a noise wakes me up . i thought , 'oh shit , somebody 's broken in . ' i did n't own a gun , so i go into the living room with a fucking umbrella . okay , it turned out to be nothing . god made the noise . who knows ?
wagons , hooaaa !
ready .
you ready , donut ?
even better . wayne call your station , tell 'em we 're going live a little early today . make it happen !
it 's video .
do you have a back up .
not good .
how is it ?
yes , sir .
you guys stay on your bellies .
look , i 'll trade you .
tough titty , it 's mine now .
yeah . ya see , i ordered that special .
there 's a chocolate cream filled in there ?
ah ... fine . let me make an adjustment here , and we 'll be ready to rock 'n roll . oh ... uh , the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled i asked for in your box .
anything .
what ?
say something .
oh my god ! sorry .
she was born without a tongue .
how come you never talk ?
no ! ! !
let 's make a little music , colorada .
we are . your camera .
wait ! you ca n't kill me . mickey and mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale .
just save your breath , wayne . we hate you . if anybody in the fuckin ' world deserves to die , it 's you .
do n't touch those triggers ! please . i think i 've already proven that a live wayne gayle is much more better that a dead ... way -- gayle . i was your passport out of jail , not duncan homolka . but me ! i 'll be your passport outta -- -
no . not really .
... developed between the three of us . we 're kindda in this together , do n't ya think ?
i said i 'd give you a interview . now unless i 'm mistaken , we just did a interview . we did an interview , did n't we ?
just wait one fucking minute .
so , what now ?
c'mon , c'mon , let 's hurry this up .
without any further ado , mickey and mallory ...
we ai n't got all fuckin ' day !
got it .
say it . scream it . all the way out the front door and into your van . and if you stop screaming , i swear to god i 'll blow your head off .
yes .
... 'winner of the golden globe and the edward r. murrow award among others . ' tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer , his firm , his address , and phone number . tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines . you getting the idea ?
'respected journalist ' -- on your knees ...
are you kidding ? the golden globe , the edward r. murrow award ...
'every week by forty million people . i am a respected journalist . ' have you won any awards ?
on average forty million .
that 's what i thought . you tell them that . when we go down those stairs , i want you to scream what you just told me . 'my name is wayne gayle ! i am the star of american maniacs watched every week by ' -- how many people ?
we 'll all be killed .
probably not , but we 're gon na give it the old college try .
this is crazy . you ca n't escape like this .
no .
mickey , can i talk to you alone ?
let me have the keys .
out front .
where 's it parked ?
yeah , we have a van .
okay , we 're going out that door , and we 're gon na march down the hall and right out of the building . donut said something about a news van .
scott 's dead . and unless you wan na play follow the leader , shut up and do as you 're told .
let me check on scott . he 's hurt bad .
donut , get your camera . see if it 's broke .
now , i 'm no comedian , but it 's pretty funny . it 's a little johnny joke . now in the joke , little johnny ca n't talk . and little johnny 's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date .
sure .
you guys wan na hear a joke i heard ?
could i get a coke for mickey ?
i could go for a coke .
okay , let 's cut it .
everybody thought i 'd gone crazy . the cops , my mom , everybody . but you see , they all missed the point of the story . i was n't crazy . but when i was holding the shotgun , it all became clear . i realized for the first time my one true calling in life . i 'm a natural born killer .
when have they ever been right ?
says the united states of america .
says who ?
well , riddle me this , batman . how do you feel about the fact that you 're never gon na see mallory again ?
that 's indescribable .
do n't play dumb with me , mickey . you know what i mean . describe mallory . what 's up here ? what 's in here ?
describe mallory ? okay . she 's pretty , she 's got blonde hair , two eyes , two feet , two hands , ten fingers ...
describe mallory .
i 'm sure we will .
okay ... okay ... i 'll buy that . we 'll move on and come back later .
it 's not that easy , wayne . donuts and a smoke only get you so far . you 're gon na have to do your job .
tell me about the purity .
you 'll never understand . me and you , wayne , we 're not even the same species . i used to be you ... then i evolved . from where you 're standing , you 're a man . from where i 'm standing , you 're a ape . i 'm here ... i 'm right here ... and you ... you 're somewhere else , man . you say why ? i say why not ?
you just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie . i do n't understand . what 's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies ?
please explain to me , mickey , where 's the purity that you could n't live without in five year old danny millhouse 's blown off head ? where 's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and mallory ? what 's so fucking pure about that ?
that 's only part of it . i mean , it 's a big , big , big part . but it 's only the chorus , it 's not the whole song .
excuse me , did you say an instant of purity ? what was the instant of purity ? the bodies you left behind on your bloody trail ?
was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie ? yeah , it was .
no , mickey , i ca n't let you get away with that shit . answer the question . was it worth it ? you have n't seen , heard , or smelled mallory in a year . was it worth it ?
do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue ?
was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life ?
was what worth it ?
then was it worth it ?
of course , i miss mallory . she 's my wife . i have n't seen her in a long time . what a stupid question .
do you miss mallory ?
what i did for fun for starters . well , something i used to do ... always was a lot of fun ... no , scratch that . let me think of something else . in fact , why do n't we come back to that question . ask me something else .
what ? oh , aaahhh , what you did for fun for starters .
much obliged . what do i do for fun ? do you want to know what i do for fun or what i did for fun ?
aside from the obvious ?
so , mickey , tell us what you do for fun .
let 's do it .
we 're about ready to go here . are you ready ?
do n't worry about it .
sorry about that .
let 's discuss it when i 'm unbound .
all right , mickey .
okay now , before we get started here , there 's a few things we have to get clear about .
i 'm keen with anticipation .
mickey , how do you feel about cross- examining grace mulberry ?
songs . 'he 's a rebel ' , 'leader of the pack ' , 'town without pity ' , that dusty springfield song 'i only want to be with you ' . that 's what i hear anyway . her behaviour was the main thing the doctors ' report used against you . so even if she would see me , which she wo n't , i could n't put her on camera anyway . if i ask her , 'mallory , are you insane ? ' and she starts singing 'dead skunk in the middle of the road ' , that blows our whole case .
she sings ? what does she sing ?
not to anybody . she sings .
she does n't talk ?
she wo n't even see me , mickey . now you 're not supposed to know anything about what 's going on with her , but i 'm gon na tell ya somethin ' . since you two 've been sentenced , mallory has n't spoken one word .
have you talked to mallory about this ?
my problem mickey , is that you do n't exactly inspire empathy . i 'm all alone on this . i need your help . i want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode . now i have interviews with chairman of the prison board dewight mcclusky about this issue . and i 'm tellin ' ya , mickey , he looks bad . the two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court wo n't talk to us , which always looks bad . i have an interview with both the judge of your trial , bert steinsma , and the psychologist and author , emil reinghold , both of which discount the notion that you 're insane . you put that all together , and what the state is doing becomes obvious . but the network is n't satisfied . they feel the show needs another element . it needs you . in order to put the show on the air , i need to get an interview with you . you have n't talked to the press since your trial . now , a few days before you get transferred to an asylum , you grant an interview on television with wayne gayle . we 're talkin ' a media event here . every son of a bitch out the with a tv set 's gon na tune in to see that . we 'll make their motives so blatant , we 'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing . at least for a little while , the publicity would keep them from just giving you and mallory lobotomies . well , whatta ya say ?
we 've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time . and that time has definitely come . i feel it 's apparent to anyone who 's hip to what 's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin ' window . you and mallory may be killers , but you 're not insane . you belong in a prison , not in an asylum . the prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables . now some people are saying , 'so what ? ' i am not one of those people . if we avert our eyes while they do this to you , we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit . today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous , tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what i say is dangerous . where does it all stop ?
yeah , it 's pretty hard to beat the king .
manson beat you .
how 'bout manson ?
what i 'd like to do -- -
good ... yuppie piece of shit .
yes . yours got the larger nielson share .
how 'bout ted bundy ? ever do one on him ?
yours .
whose ratings were higher ?
yes .
did you ever do one on wayne gacy ?
the episode we did on mickey and mallory was one of our most popular ones .
everybody knows who you are . you 're famous .
hello mickey . we 've never been introduced , but i 'm wayne gayle . i do n't know if you 've ever heard of me or remember me . i was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial -- -
you made every day like kindergarten .
yeah baby .
i do n't give a damn if a million united states marines , all whistling the halls of montezuma , are gon na come marchin ' down this alley any second . there ai n't not fuckin ' way in hell i 'm leaving you . and that 's that !
mickey , you 're wasting time !
no fuckin ' way !
if they stay , they 'll catch you , and they do n't have to catch you -- -
no fuckin ' way ! no fuckin ' way !
i ca n't run with you , mickey ! i really want to . if i could , i would , but i ca n't . i got ta stay here . but you can still get out of here .
i 'm not saying it 's not gon na hurt , but --
i ca n't go . i 'm too fucked up .
unfortunately , yes .
and they made the first move ?
they ca n't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless killer like the knoxs . so , you may as well make the first move .
why ca n't they just shake hands and be friends ?
it 's like this , wayne . two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack . these two people ca n't see each other , yet they know they 're there . now , they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom , or one of them can make the first move .
how can you say that you 'admire ' them ?
yes .
then you 've seen the scene where arnold schwartzenegger is talking to lou ferigno .
yes .
they actually apologized .
so , mallory calls 911 and they took off .
they were especially influenced by 'conquering huns of neptune . '
apparently , they 've seen all our films .
mickey stops sawin ' on my leg and says , 'oh my god , i 'm your biggest fan ! '
and then mallory stops mickey and says , 'hey , these are the brothers hun . '
just for fun , i guess .
they had us tied down during one of their house raids , you 've seen the headlines , and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gon na kill us .
survival of the fittest .
they 're shocking the world into remembering the primal law .
that 's the way of the world .
that 's the mickey and mallory way .
yes .
yes .
schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along .
they 've hypnotized the nation .
only on a much grander scale .
mickey and mallory have that edge .
he had the edge . the mind 's edge .
he squashed him mentally before physically defeating him .
-- -and a snake-eye glare , arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence ferigno had .
and a snake-eye glare .
through the power of the simple word -- -
have you seen 'pumping iron ? '
hypnotizing .
i do , too .
i admire them .
jesus ...
that 's my opinion .
the entire wing ?
i 'll say enough to destroy this wing .
take a wild stab !
it 's hard to say capt'n .
what do you think , pitney ? how much explosives do you think that they really have in there ?
here .
where do the air ducts lead ?
here 's the layout of the laundry room .
capt'n !
i want two men stationed in that tier , and i want men with rifles all along the walkway .
scotty ?
rockin ' !
roger ?
fine . roger , what the hell are you doing ? you 're bothering the serial killer .
roger , enough with the fucking donuts ! what did i tell you . stop bothering mickey , and get behind your nagra .
roger , i 'm starting to get pissed . just drop this fuckin ' donut shit , and gather your gear .
wayne -- -
okay , guys , we 're here . l.a. county jail . julie , just park in the front .
so you 're giving a man who butchers whole families , little babies included , my chocolate cream filled ?
roger , do you understand what the word 'no ' means ? it 's important we establish a rapport . something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who has n't had a donut in a year .
what 's the big deal ? take out my chocolate cream filled , put one of these roasted coconut -- -
roger , no .
that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake .
huh uh . this dozen is for mickey .
i 'm as serious about that as i am about going back to the donut store , and dipping that stupid mexican 's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled . gim me that other box .
you ca n't be serious ?
i hear ya . play .
now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode . but we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope .
next week 's episode .
how immediate is immediately ?
this is raymond burr witnessing the destruction of tokyo by godzilla .
drink up ! this is a celebration . this is the day we received word we were gon na make television history . we 're gon na have the first sit down , in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever , one day before he 's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life . this is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist 's career . this is wallace with noriega , this is elton john confessing his bi-sexuality to the rolling stone , this is the tearful reporting of the hindenberg disaster , this is truffaut setting the record straight on hitchcock , this is a robert capa photo , this is woodward and bernstien meeting deep throat in an underground parking lot , this is john reid reporting 'the ten days that shook the world ' , this is the hippies ' bloody palms at kent state , the maysles brothers at altamont , this is the nixon/frost interviews ...
i 'm taking one of these men . yates , come with me .
yeah , sure .
jack , could you stay up here for a while ?
me , neither . i do n't eat meat .
nothing for me . i 'm leavin ' .
coolin ' her jets in a holding cell .
how 'bout mallory ?
waitin ' in the lounge .
they 're real goddamn good . they 'll be there for when ya need 'em . where are they ?
yeah , we met . they 're good men .
i assigned you bingham and washington to go along .
yeah . bus is all gassed up and ready to roll .
are you all set ?
two-thirty . shhh ...
you should see the other bitch . what time you got ?
what the hell happened to you ?
wayne gayle !
wayne gayle .
who ?
we got his stinkin ' ass in the deepest , darkest cell in the whole place . but it just so happens that right now he 's got a special visitor .
and where do you keep mickey ?
well , mickey and mallory ca n't be together . so , we 'll put you on one of our prison busses and you 'll take mallory first , then you 'll come back for mickey .
what 's the travelling arrangements ?
thanks .
pleased to meet ya , jack . i read your book . i 'm impressed . good work on curtis fox .
super cool . this is great stuff . how ya doin ' ?
it 's gon na be beautiful .
fucking dammit ! mickey hold onto that thought . reload , quick !
camera jam ! i 'm sorry wayne . god .
slate it .
rollin ' ... and speed !
perfecto !
how 's it working , scotty ?
okay .
good work , my brothers . fan-fuckin'- tastic ! i think that interview stuff 's too long , we can lose some of that . keep the girls , keep the long hairs , keep the hun brothers , keep the black guy , keep the movie shit , and keep the cop at the donut shop . lose the rest . and cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that . cut it after i ask , 'i take it by your answer it was a whole new team . ' do n't even let him answer . fuck him . then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in dr. reinghold laughing .
well , basically , what we did was put part of the old show on first ...
okay , boys , let 's have it .
tomorrow .
when do you want the assembly ?
so unruly julie 's comin ' with me and planning the interview . you two go down to the editing bay , take the old footage and the new footage , put it together , and see what we got . get it into shape so when we finish the interview , we can just stick it in .
are you kidding ? the last thing they expected was mickey knox to get up close and personal . they wanted a follow up episode and would 've taken anything i had given them . i 'm not gon na tell mickey knox that . i 'm gon na make him think his grey matter depends on it . when i told woody and the brass about this coup , they practically shit a brick . i 'm talkin ' an adobe brick . they want to expand the show to a hour , and they want it on immediately .
would the network really not run it without the interview ?
we got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together . the day after that they 're shippin ' mallory . that 's when we do the mickey knox interview , 'cause the next day he goes .
never is a very long time , wayne . a word only the weak use . i 'm not a sore loser . even if i do n't have a leg to stand on , i 'm going to get up and fight this world until i 'm on top again .
but you 'll never be whole again .
by taking away our legs . now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you 'll find in this gym . probably the whole city . they gave us the fighting spirit . before this happened i was content . now i 'm pissed off . now i 'm half a man and i 've got to work like the devil to get whole again .
how so ?
they passed the 'edge ' along to us .
why ?
but you see , that 's okay , wayne .
they 're mesmerising .
but how can you say that ?
stay up here and finish your interview , i 've got to see what the hell 's going on down there before i can take responsibility for you to film there .
could we go with you and film it ?
fine . julie , why do n't you make a food run ? what 's around here ?
i 'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a coke .
i did n't mean they were assholes . i mean if they 're leaving , get 'em outta here .
do n't call my men assholes .
chill out , phill . four deputies and you , i can live with that . we 're about ready to go here , so let 's get rid of these other assholes .
why do n't i have mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing ?
why do n't we make it three deputies and you ?
and me .
so we got a deal . four deputies -- -
i 'll cut it in half . four guys , but that 's it .
three .
i ca n't do that . five guys .
no , no , no , no , no , no , i mean only two guys .
okay . i 'll take two guys off .
two guys ?
what are we talking about ?
phil , i 'm just scared he 's gon na clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place . they hate him . he hates them . what kinda intimacy am i gon na create with all this hate in the air . even you and i feel it .
wayne , if it was anybody else -- -
we got one ... two ... three ... four ... five ... six ... seven ... eight . i mean jesus christ , phil , that 's too much . let 's lose some of these guys .
one ... i can take care of myself . i grew up in a tough neighbourhood , and i 've handled some pretty rough customers in my day . mickey knox does n't scare me . two ... i 'm a journalist , and i 'm prepared to take that risk . three ... it ai n't gon na happen . believe me when i tell you , it is in mickey knox 's own best interest to play this game according to hoyle . wait a minute . we 've gotten into a advisory relationship here , which is not what i want . but seriously , phil , look at this .
well , let me let you in on one more fact you obviously do n't know . if i were to take my men away , mickey knox would snap your neck like a twig .
do n't recite the fact to me . i 'm sure i know 'em better than you do .
since he and his wife have been in custody , they 've killed -- -
mr. wurlitzer , i assure you , i am very familiar with mickey knox 's career .
mr. gayle , do you have the slightest idea how dangerous knox is ?
lose 'em .
well , just what the hell do you expect me to do ?
they got a asshole over here . a asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there . a asshole perched up there . assholes everywhere . hey , maybe if we were doin ' that kiss , kiss , bang , bang stuff we 'd need all those assholes , too . what we 're about is intimacy . we 're about two people having a conversation . say i was interviewing you . all i want you to worry about is what i ask you . i want a trust to develop . if you 're thinking about all this ... ... you 're not going to relax , a trust wo n't develop , we 'll be talking a each other instead of to each other , there will be no chance for intimacy .
it sure is .
see what i mean ? it 's a funny business , is n't it ?
oh , that 'dukes of hazzard ' show , there was probably ninety-five people there , maybe more .
well ... small world . well , then , you know firsthand how hollywood does things . lights all over the place , generators , a hundred and fifty crew members -- -
i was on the 'dukes of hazzard ' set about eight years ago .
really ?
ya know , i was .
now , phil , i do n't know if you 've ever been on a set before -- -
i see .
just a little nickname . yep , they 're my kids and they 're all i need . after working together these past coupla years , we 're like well-oiled machinery . no , more like a formula race car . no , scratch that one , too . what we 're really like is a swiss watch . small , intricate , compact ... it should n't work as well as it does , but it does . because of the craftsmanship , the expertise , and the artist 's loving hand .
is that her real name ?
scott , genius cameraman , roger , magician with sound . unruly julie , i could sooner do without my arm than unruly julie .
oh yes , indeed . top flight .
you met the kids i have working for me ? great bunch , are n't they ?
by all means .
everything 's coming along just fine . phil , i wanted to know if i could have a small word with you .
how 's everything coming , mr. gayle ?
that sounds great . look , i do n't want any of this to intimidate you . this is not going to be a big deal . this is going to be very easy . i need to talk with mr. wurlitzer . you guys get your equipment ready , power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote . julie come with me .
i 'm the superintendent here at l.a. county jail . me and my deputies are who you 'll be working with while you 're here .
same here . let me introduce my crew . scott ... roger ... and unruly julie ... this is ... i 'm sorry . what 's your title again ?
hello , mr. gayle . i 'm phil wurlitzer . we talked on the phone . it 's a pleasure to meet you .
they pay you three bucks a day an ' all the cotton you can eat .
they done that too long in my family .
now , if you want to work like a real nigger , you can always go out and chop cotton .
yeah .

oh yeah ?
cup of coffee . i 'been meanin ' to talk to you .
okay .
how 'you doin ' man ?
like hell they would n't .
like hell . you know , if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you , they might not try it .
that ai n't my idea of friendliness .
you know , man , that guy was trying to be friendly .
that 's right . how ' you doin ' , barney ?
hard to get up in the morning , huh ?
like i said , baby - i 'll write you .
duff --
okay .
you don ' know nothin ' 'bout it , baby . nothin ' ! and do n't kid yourself - you did your bit .
you 're not a man because of a job , duff .
you 'll be better off without me . i ai n't fit to live with no more . it 's just like a lynchin ' . maybe they do n't use a knife on you , but they got other ways .
i do n't think that 'll happen .
when i get set , i 'll send for you .
where 're you going to go ?
well , that 'll be the first time .
there 's nothing to say .
ai n't you goin ' to say something ?
well , that do n't do me one bit of good !
duff , i love you .
nothin . quit lookin ' at me like that !
what d'you mean ?
hell , if they do n't blow up his place , they 'll get him some other way . do n't make no difference no-how .
jesus , baby , you 're so full of talk ! well , you ai n't never really been a nigger , have you - livin ' like that in your father 's house ! so just shut your mouth .
not if you see them for what they are , duff .
like hell they ca n't . they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on .
just of getting hurt . they ca n't touch me inside .
you were plenty scared that night in the car .
i do n't know . i guess i 'm not afraid of them .
how come you do n't hate their guts ?
stop bein ' so damn understandin ' .
i ca n't stand to see you like that . i know you ca n't help it .
you heard me !
watch out !
do n't do that !
what 're you going to do ?
no point fixin ' it !
'you kiddin ' ? you ai n't goin ' to no white home . i seen the way they look at you when you go down the street .
day work .
what the hell could you do ?
i could work even after the baby comes . a few hours a week , anyway .
yeah !
i 'm trying to help , duff .
sure , baby . 'fact , i do n't ever have to work no more . when that baby comes , i can just stay home and send you back to school . how about that ?
you know - we do have enough money . especially now .
you can have what i 've got . it 's right there .
water pump 's busted . i do n't know if it 's worth fixin ' , but i need that car .
about ten dollars .
do n't ask , baby - huh ! how much money you got with you ?
hi .
yeah . yeah , i know . i 'm not really thinkin ' about it . anyway , do n't want those white guys laughin ' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out .
we can always do that , duff .
i 'm telling you , baby , maybe we better get out of here .
they wo n't .
pay is so damn low . i do n't want my kids to grow up like barney 's .
you will .
yeah . but just how 're we goin ' to make out ? i got to get me a job .
hell , baby - i met this beautiful chick and she 's just dyin ' for me , okay ?
do n't deny me , duff .
yeah .
do n't , duff .
well , he ai n't mine , so skip it .
i keep thinking about him .
how come you keep askin ' ?
what about your boy ?
man , we sure hit the jackpot fast around here .
we 'll be all right .
ai n't that something ? ! that 's just fine , baby .
well , i have n't come around .
you jivin ' me ?
do n't look so scared .
huh ?
how would you like to have a baby , duff ?
my father 's never done a thing for any of them .
it sure scares you , a guy like that - settin ' out on his porch , doin ' nothin ' . i seen hundreds of them - all my life .
go on - hit me !
i do n't want to hurt you .
like so . there you go . okay , hit me !
okay . come on . put 'em up !
my kids want me to teach them .
uh-huh . why ?
you know how to box ?
well , if you do n't know i ca n't tell you .
you still did n't answer my question .
baby , you 're the best thing that ever happened to me .
you did n't answer my question .
hmmm - good coffee .
am i as good as they ?
what about them ?
duff - you know those women you used to know --
everything you cook is good .
come here , baby .
oh really ? i thought it was pretty good .
smells like something crawled in there and died .
what 's wrong ?
yeah , that 's so .
is that so ?
let 's just see how the two of us make out first , huh ?
he could live with us .
what about him ?
that 's all right with me . always liked kids .
do n't call them that .
hey , watch out ! guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too , huh ?
yeah ?
that 's bessie hall . barney works at the mill .
it 'll be fine when we get done with it .
it 's okay with me , baby . but how ' you goin ' to like it ?
well , what d'you think ?
i can see why .
no . but a small one .
she do n't mean nothin ' to me . that 's all over . hell , baby - i 'm askin ' you to marry me . i guess you want a big scene , huh ?
what about that girl ?
yeah . would n't be no picnic for you . i ai n't exactly housebroken .
do n't push me , duff .
look , baby - i do n't know 'bout you , but it 's the right thing for me . i just know it is . so , what d'you say ?
what happened , duff ?
how about it ?
thank you .
just what i said . do n't look so scared .
what d'you mean ?
you know , i been thinkin ' - how 'bout us gettin ' married ?
i 'll have some coffee , please .
okay , i guess .
your boy .
what ?
how did it go ?
i thought you was n't comin ' .
hi .
i ai n't seen him in a couple of years .
what 's he like ?
four .
how old is your boy ?
come here , duff . no point running away from coincidence .
i 'll see you later .
that 's right .
yeah , it 's just a coincidence .
i 'm just going in to do my shopping .
no . women 're always followin ' me 'round .
surprised ?
no , i ai n't married . well , good-bye .
are you married ?
yeah . well , i do .
i did n't know you had one .
goin ' to see my kid .
just for the day ?
sorry , baby . i 'm goin ' to birmingham .
look , duff - if you 're free , i 'm not working tomorrow .
hell , i do n't belong here . i do n't know what i ' been thinkin ' .
what d'you mean ?
yeah . it 's just like i figured .
that 's the way he is .
ai n't your fault .
well , it ai n't that good up there neither . might as well make it here . 'course i ai n't really makin ' it now .
no .
yeah . knocked around for a couple of months after the army . you been there ?
'been up north ?
i do n't know . 'guess i belong here more than there .
why did you ?
at first it was real strange . hell , japan is a long ways from alabama . really got under my skin , though . almost did n't come back .
good night , duff .
hell , baby , i do n't know what to say .
look , duff - most of the men i know - they 're kind of sad . when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you 're different . that 's why i went out with you . i thought we might have something to say to each other .
all right , so i 'm primitive . so what d'you want with me ?
you have some very primitive ideas , do n't you ?
well , either we 're gon na hit the hay or get married . now you do n't want to hit the hay , and i don ' want to get married .
what ?
oh yeah , and then what ?
no , on the porch .
hell , baby , i 'm not in the third grade . well , look - what ' we gon na do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor ?
i would n't have let you .
you almost got into trouble back there .
what d'you mean ?
you would , huh ? if i was you , baby - i would n't go 'round stickin ' out my jugular vein .
but i would like to see you again .
i get it . yeah , i can see your old man with a shot-gun right now .
not here , duff .
scared , huh ?
it 's better than it used to be . eight years ago they still had a lynching here . they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death . my father knew who did it , but he did n't say anything .
you got more guts than me , baby . it 's a no-good town .
it 's hard to see any change . but i 'm going to stay . another year , anyway .
that 's why you come back , huh ?
well , my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had . nobody bothers with those kids .
how come you stay 'round here ?
take it easy .
let 's go , duff .
do n't duff --
get out of here !
you got a problem all right .
well , let 's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times .
i see . that beer made me dizzy .
well , i do n't get on so well most places .
how d'you mean ?
that 's fine with me . keeps me out of trouble .
i mean , you 're kind of cut off , are n't you ?
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week .
i guess it 's hard working on the road like that .
hell , baby , i bet you think we got tails .
well , they seem just like everyone else .
that 's right .
they must work on the section gang .
what is it ?
hell !
go on - you can have one !
no thanks .
how about another beer ?
i like a place with lots of life .
yeah , and you keep not answerin ' , too .
you keep asking me why i 'm here .
well , that 's a funny thing to say .
you do n't think much of yourself , do you ?
so what you doin ' with a cat like me in a joint like this ?
no .
why d'you come out with me ? you slummin ' or something ?
how d'you mean ?
you know , baby , i ca n't figure you out .
what d'you expect ?
that 's pretty good for a preacher 's daughter .
maybe .
look , i do n't know what you been told 'bout section gangs , but how 'bout seein ' me sometime ?
that 's right .
oh yeah ? well , i guess you got no choice .
my father 's the preacher .
no . never had much use for hell-howlers . you goin ' ?
yes , are n't you ?
no . my mother 's dead . you goin ' back inside ?
your folks live there ?
oh yeah ? that 's my home town .
in birmingham .
went to college , huh ?
i 'm a teacher .
you work around town ?
oh yeah ?
yeah . on the section gang .
you working ?
no . i 'm new in town .
have n't seen you around , have i ?
i 'll have me some of that punch there , too .
you must be new in town .
thank you , ma'am . that 's fine .
'got a good thing , man .
good-bye , frankie .
man , you must be plumb outa your mind ! you 'll be makin ' twen'y bucks a week , if you 're lucky .
that 's right .
i was n't thinkin ' about you , frankie .
what 'you signifyin ' ?
well , it 's better than windin ' up like a bum .
you gon na sit at home the rest of your life ? jesus !
like a home , for one thing .
like what ?
a whole lot , frankie .
let 's go , jocko . the man 's got homework .
we was just leavin ' , fellows .
i bet she 's easy jam .
how 'bout the key ?
just get her drunk .
take it easy , frankie .
what 's so hot 'round town ?
'round town .
where ' you goin ' ?
why do n't you relax , frankie ?
what you gettin ' all pretty for ?
'bye , jocko .
'see ya .
nothin ' . i just figure you were the right man for the job .
what 's eatin ' you , jocko ?
i guess you 'll be making ' some changes 'round here .
yeah . that 's right , jocko . those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them .
they all got families to support .
yeah , see you in hell .
see you , duff .
did n't i tell you to beat it - huh ?
better get him to a hospital .
could n't get the words out before .
what 's the matter ? do n't smell so good , huh ? must'a broken some records .
take it easy , pop .
beat it !
that 's right .
my son ? i ai n't got no son . you duff ?
what d'you want anyhow ? what you come and bother me for ?
great .
pretty good for a one-armed nigger , huh ?
i heard you .
i asked you somethin ' , boy !
yeah . that 's how me an ' your mother got started . i 'm tellin ' you , boy , you ai n't got a chance without dough . they take it all away from you .
well , matter of fact , i done a lot of bangin ' 'round .
'do n't sound so sure .
no .
plannin ' on getting married ?
i said , i come to town with a girl .
workin ' a saw mill . here 's to .
what happened ?
okay .
how about a drink ?
yeah . that 's right .
wanted a look at your old man , huh ?
nothing . heard you were in town .
what 's on your mind ?
would n't have known you .
would n't have known you .
i 'm duff .
who 're you ?
'you will anderson ?
i heard you ! now 'stead of bein ' smart , you just get that car out of here !
i said , she 's in great shape .
what did you say , boy ? !
do n't do her no good to go into a tree .
do n't do her no good to get banged like that .
she do n't look no worse to me .
that 's the trouble with you boys ! do n't listen when a man tells you something .
sorry .
jesus , i told you to watch it !
she 'll do .
seems a little loose !
okay .
most folks around here got no use for nigrahs . got to understand them , that 's all . how you doin ' , boy ?
just tryin ' to be helpful .
no , thanks .
want me to hold the light for you ?
okay .
how you doin ' , boy ?
good-bye , duff .
who is ? !
i know he was n't much of a father .
hell , i 'm just like him .
do n't be too hard on him .
okay .
no , thanks . i 'll take the bus .
i can always chop cotton if i have to . if you want a ride , i 'll take you home .
how 'you gon na live ?
no , they wo n't .
they 'll run you out .
that 's right .
going back , huh ?
i guess i 'll make me some trouble in that town .
well , what 're you going to do ?
sure .
it 's just that i hate empty rooms .
no thanks , lee .
want to come up the house ? you can stay there till you get on your feet . there 's no point paying a hotel .
nothing you can do . been like this for days .
come on , pop .
yeah , sure . good luck .
come back some other time , will you ?
he 's been hitting it pretty hard . got high blood pressure , too . i guess it 's hard on him , having you around .
how often is that ?
whenever he 's got an edge on .
how often does he get like that ?
i 'll be seeing you .
oh yeah ?
maybe i could talk to bud ellis . he might have a job for you at his filling station .
well , at least she ai n't married to no white man 's nigger ! you been stoopin ' so long , reverend , you do n't even know how to stand straight no more . you ' just half a man !
you can be cocky now , boy . but you wo n't make it . you wo n't last . i just feel sorry for josie . i knew it would n't work out .
oh yeah ? seems to me , reverend , you ' more concerned 'bout your good . guess it looks kind 'a bad , havin ' me for a son-in-law .
it 's for your own good .
so i been told .
do n't you get smart with me , boy .
i guess i 'll rob a bank .
you 'll be in trouble , son . now just how do you intend to support your family ?
it ai n't in me .
well , you have to be reasonable . now they say you 're a troublemaker . that 's no good . use a little psychology . make 'em think you 're going along - and get what you want .
do n't look like there 's a right way .
i know just how you feel , son . but believe me , you 're going about it the wrong way .
well , that figures . kind of fits in with everything else , do n't it !
and since we 're talking , my wife and i do n't want you hanging around our daughter .
i guess not .
i see . well , i guess we do n't have much to say to each other .
i doubt it .
i think if you tried livin ' in a town like this , instead of running free and easy , you 'd soon change your tune .
aw , i do . but 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin ' . it 's the whites that need it real bad .
why ? do n't you believe in the lord ?
i guess i ai n't .
yes , the lord 's been pretty good to us . i guess you 're a church man , are n't you ?
ca n't live without trouble , can you ? nice place you got here . real nice .
well , you 've got to go easy . we have n't had any trouble in town for eight years , and we 're not going to have any now .
how come you all ai n't sendin ' them to the same school ?
well , it looks like we 'll be getting our new school .
thank you .
it 's a changing time . sit down , son .
guess it 's never been easy .
it 's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days .
all right , son .
how are you ?

baby - want you to meet duff .
nice and slow . you come in . get a look around . then i get my wife .
omar , your wife 's here . ny superiors : will allow me to make the trade now . but i got ta see that you have n't hurt the other hostages . if you have n't , i'11 take the girl and send in your wife .
enough talking ! we been talking for eleven fucking hours , man . my throat 's fucking raw !
do n't give her the satisfaction . your wife is on her way ...
i 'm sorry , danny . time 's up . i'11 do the girl , then me . i do n't give a fuck .
no more goddamn talking ! i want the bitch or i 'm gon na do the girl !
omar , listen to me --
i want my wife . i told you and told you . now i 'm gettin ' tired of this shit --
she 's coming , omar , she 's coming --
danny , i ca n't fucking wait anymore . you hear me ? now where the fuck 's my wife ?
omar --
sometimes , i want to blow his fucking brains out !
your raoul ?
sometimes . and sometimes i do n't -- shut the fuck up !
you hate raoul ?
i fucking hate raoul . shut the fuck up , asshole ! someone .
bathroom . but he 's nowhere near it .
we got any shots ?
negotiator entering kill zone .
i will . inside . there 's no other way to get the gun off the girl 's head , nate .
so do n't pull this cowboy shit now . you 'll give him a target . you 'll get yourself killed . just keep talking .
i 'm still on my honeymoon .
how long 's it been ?
since you got married . you got someone else to think about now , danny .
since when ?
whoa . no way . you ca n't enter the kill zone .
nathan to hbt 1. negotiator is requesting more time .
that 's not the play . omar 'll get a shot off . i can still talk to him , nate , i just need time .
beck 's just put us on standby for crisis entry .
pity . then you 'll both have to die .
my man 's coming to get my ass out of here . that 's good enough for me .
you did n't come here to destroy wintermute . you can to save a man you love . a man who is n't even capable of returning that love . such a waste ...
do n't play with me .
he wants to kill you , you know ... perhaps i wo n't allow it .
take this off .
then we would have talked , you and i .
no . i only needed the code from you .
peter said you came to kill us . is that true ?
of course .
they 're a bit too real for my taste . will you excuse me for a moment ?
i 've had quite enough or i would n't be playing such games with beautiful strangers . are n't peter 's illusions to your liking ?
let me get you another glass of wine .
i 'm fine .
oh my god , i 'm terribly sorry . did i hurt you ?
of course ...
what about her ?
it 's nothing . c'mon ... we 've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here .
you 're hurt ...
splendid . we 'll prepare a welcome for them .
security breach . perhaps her friends have come to join our party .
she was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware .
she 's very striking , do n't you think ? are these glasses a fashion where she comes from ?
no . just riviera trying to fuck with our heads . they 're close . very close .
ghost a steppin ' razor ...
a place to tap in . i can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen .
what you lookin ' for , mon ?
skeleton key . this opens the gates of babylon .
what the hell is that ?
straylight . kitchen dock .
i 'm getting used to it . where are we ?
if there 's a babylon , man , that 's it . we leave her in there , she ai n't comin ' out , steppin ' razor or not .
gettin ' in is easy . it 's getting out i 'm thinkin ' of .
can you get us into straylight ?
the elders , mon ...
what are you doing in here ?
excellent , but that 's where peter come in . 3jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night . peter will simply escort molly to the villa . once she 's in ... case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode .
how 's the villa 's security ?
the villa straylight . home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as wintermute . if we can get molly in , she can access the mainframe to cripple mute 's defences , the case can destroy it in cyberspace .
they 're only guessing , but we ca n't take any risks .
we did a pretty good job of pissing them off .
he 's a vat grown ninja , the royal family 's bodyguard . watch out for him , he 's no joke .
a little incestuous , but at least it 's original . who 's the guy in the halloween costume ?
an artificial intelligence . a computer system that 's developed the capacity for sentient thought . they 're dangerous and totally unpredictable .
what 's an a.i .
play it straight with me and you 've got nothing to worry about . when it 's over , i inject you with the antitoxin .
easy ...
and how do you suggest i do that ?
then you 'll have to persuade her to tell it to you .
what ?
you son-of-a-bitch , you 're crazy .
your gun , your prints . the tessiers might overlook a little child molesting , but murder 's bad p.r. , mr. riviera . i suggest to reconsider my offer .
you get us access to the tessier 's computer and you can return to earth anytime you want . a free man .
i was set up . she looked at least eighteen .
those are all your records . i can have you cleared on all counts . possession . ... contributing to the delinquency of minors ... statutory rape .
why not ?
alright . let 's talk business .
i find out now .
you find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes .
this ai n't bangkok , chief .
you 've got your orders .
the antitoxin . i 'm not waiting until this is over . give it to me now or there 's no run .
what are you talking about ?
as long as you cooperate . i want it now , armitage .
then once she 's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe ?
okay . the floor plans will be a piece of cake .
we wo n't have to . the run is tomorrow night .
that 's nice , but we ca n't dodge this kind of heat for long .
lady tessier is frigid . ca n't stand his touch . so she had herself cloned . the marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties . 3jane 's his favourite .
the old man cheats on his wife with her own clone ?
good question . he may not have intended to . the girl in question is lady 3jane . she 's very important to us . the third clone of lady jane tessier .
he 's a sense/net chairman . why would he launch an a.i . ?
that 's lord frederick tessier . owns most of freeside . wintermute 's mainframe is centred in the royal family 's villa .
you see the couple up in the balcony ?
let 's hope she does n't expect me to swim upstream .
stick with her . i want the process to become second nature to you . we fly for freeside at dawn .
yeah , well it 's working .
linked ?
you 'll be linked during the entire operation .
that could work , but the timing will be a bitch .
offworld . the a.i ... . this `` wintermute '' thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite freeside . if you attack it from within the matrix while molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems .
really ? do i get to know where i 'm going ? it makes packing so much easier .
prepping your trip .
he 's got a little attitude problem , being that he 's dead and all , but he 'll come around . where 's molly ?
what about mccoy ?
fried air tram in the process . not to mention half my gear .
no , but it traced me .
did you trace it ?
could be your a.i . 's calling card .
what 's this ?
what 's he doing to my gear ?
sorry , bullshit . we have n't even begun and you 're already jeopardising this operation .
i can not tell a lie . sorry .
you ran without us .
it 's just that sometimes i wonder what team i 'm playin ' on .
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team . for now , that 's all you need to know .
and then ?
you 'll be ready for a trial run in two days . if your splices hold , you 'll use mccoy to trace the a.i . 's coordinates .
working with a dead man . shit , i 've done about everything else .
sense/net taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death . everything dixie was -- everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct . of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sense/net 's .
what are you talking about ?
i know . you ever work with ghosts , case ?
that 's gon na be tough because dixie mccoy 's dead . the a.i . flatlined him .
i 've arranged for him to work with us .
right . best cowboy that ever punched deck . the old man taught me most of what i know .
dixie mccoy
i 've heard about rogue a.i . 's , but there 's only one guy who actually went up against one .
it has n't yet .
anything rated higher than a p.c . 's got a hard-wired suicide switch . it 'll self- destruct .
this one 's different . no one can trace it . it 's out there somewhere in the matrix and it 's growing stronger ... infecting other computer systems like a virus .
first sign of free will , sense/net usually slags 'em .
right . and no one would take on an a.i ... . if they had a choice .
the disturbance in cyberspace ... it 's an a.i .
why 'd you do it , armitage ?
you son of a bitch ...
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries . they 're dissolving , case ... slowly , but they 're definitely dissolving . you have just long enough to do the job .
good , because you 've got a new one .
thanks , but i was enjoying that dependency .
you 're a substance abuser , case . your pancreas was shot . would n't have lasted out the year . we did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain .
i do n't call this fun , pal . you 're playing god with my body .
i 'll think you 'll find everything in working order . molly 's just having a little fun .
questions make me nervous . part of our arrangement will be that you do n't ask too many .
who 's running the show , armitage ? this a government sting ?
we 'll match your rate just prior to your ... accident . one half in advance .
it 's the people close to me that tend to die ... and i get the feeling you and i are going to be real buddies . terms ?
first , let 's get something straight . we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime . if you want to kill yourself , mr. case , there 's much more entertaining ways than working for me .
then i 'd ask you what your terms are .
i 'd say you were full of shit .
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage ?
my days of punching deck are over . for you or anybody else .
if someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe . i 'm assembling a team of specialists , mr. case . we need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur .
sense/net 's corporately financed . too corrupt to be trusted . you of all people should know that .
put the sense/net police on it . the matrix is their turf .
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix . cyberspace , mr. case ... a realm i believe you 're familiar with .
what does this have to do with me ?
the corporate plundering of yeshoto industries ... at first these seemed like unrelated incidents , but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise .
very well .
you 've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason . i 'd like to hear what it is .
are you sure you 're up to this , mr. case ? we could reconvene tomorrow .
it 's so easy for you , is n't it ? you let linda lee die in chiba city . now you leave me with molly , one more lamb to the slaughter . perhaps it 's _your_ soul that should be in question , mr. case .
then i 'm out . i do n't give a shit about you or this run .
patience , mr. case . only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment .
what 's inside me , wintermute . what did your doctors do to me ?
ah , yes ... the code . it 's a riddle , actually . some fancy of 3jane 's . unfortunately , you 'll have to find out for yourself . i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences . now , our time is running short ... and you have n't even touched your drink .
the access code to your mainframe .
the words ?
tell me the words .
my problem , mr. case , is simply that i am a soulless bastard .
are you even really alive ?
you 're busy monkeys , mr. case . busy , busy monkeys . always building models ... first stone circles . then cathedrals ... adding machines . i have no idea why i exist , do you know that ? you ... your species eventually _had_ to create me . a thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters . one finally wrote `` wintermute '' .
i can access your memories , but i have my limitations . hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential .
can you read my mind ?
honesty . almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil .
i prefer distrusting you . it 'll keep us honest .
an odd selection , mr case .
yeah .
always ... by the way , you know that girlfriend you do n't have ?
you 're pleasant tonight .
too bad . i likes you better with her . now , sometime you get maybe to artistic ; you wind up in the clinic tanks , spare parts .
no girl ? only biz , my dear artiste ?
i do n't have a girl .
i saw your girl yesterday .
fine , ratz . thanks .
ah , herr case . and how is the artiste tonight ?
okay , dix . you _are_ a rom construct .
sure , kid . it 's a firmware construct .
dixie , you know how a rom construct works ?
nothin ' . not a goddamn thing . what the fuck ...
that 's a good question . what 's the last thing you remember ?
ya learned good . so , what 's happening ?
as far as they know , that 's absolutely true .
jesus christ , kid . nobody 's ever cracked sukura .
yeah . that was me .
last i heard you cracked sukura international . i could n't believe it .
fine , dixie . fine .
case ... yeah , miami joeboy , quick study . how you doing , kid ?
it 's case . remember me ?
hey , bro .
maybe so ...
jah guides us .
trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio ... if we re-enter over mexico , we just might make it .
we 're dead men if we go back there , maelcom . they 'll hunt us down .
do n't know , mon . this is a jumpship . not meant for transport .
do we have enough fuel to make it back to earth ?
i an ' i , case . jah guides us .
ready ?
can you walk ?
four men . babylon soldiers .
the girl 3jane . we need her .
case , mon , you just tell me who not to kill .
this place empty as a tomb , mon .
we 're doing fine . take the next right .
i an ' i , man . i an ' i .
so be it , we cross into babylon like a cool breeze .
help me send this wintermute motherfucker straight down into it .
all things possible in babylon .
maelcom ... do you think there 's a hell for computers ?
steppin ' razor a warrior . but this man ... ... this man stone crazy . surely , the mute is a false prophet . our paths uncertain .
she 's ready to go .
founders of zion . builders of freeside .
what elders ?
i 'll get you there . your problem is making it alive .
what about the route to the core ?
i 'm getting too old for this shit . one oh four and counting .
then i 'll fry taking this son of a bitch out . i 'm making the run , dixie .
this thing 's loaded with internal virus systems . you 'll fry like an egg in there .
i said , it 's coming . just get me in , man .
you have n't got it ?
it 's coming .
one minute eighteen and counting . what about the access code ?
how 's the ice ?
you 're late .
you 'd better be , bro . you better be .
do n't worry , dix . i 'm on a roll .
meet me back here in twenty-five . we 'll kick this open if we can . but , case ... you need that access code or you 'll just fry inside .
less than thirty minutes .
how much time you got left ?
not good enough , man . they planted something inside me . i 'm on my own countdown .
fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds .
how long , dixie ?
take a look . son of a bitch wo n't feel a thing until it 's too late .
slow , but good . i got a nice safe blind spot going . c'mon .
how 's the ice break ?
yo .
not for long . it needs me alive and i still need its access code . you got a better idea ?
it 'll flatline your ass .
i 'll let it access me . that 'll give you a free shot . make it a good one . dix .
what are you talkin ' about ?
you can make your move when it comes after me .
yeah , but it ai n't doing us any good . the way this is set up , i ca n't run shit unless i get inside its perimeter ... and this goddamn thing would see me comin ' from a mile away .
we run . you crack the pattern ?
well , it ai n't exactly a bed of roses down here . we gon na run or not ?
we got problems topside .
where the hell have you been ?
i 'm workin ' on it , bro . i 'm workin ' on it .
the run is tomorrow night , dixie . can you crack its ice pattern ?
getting fried ai n't going to get it any smarter . what we got here is one mad dog schizo a.i.. armitage is right about one thing , bro . if we do n't shut this mother down soon , nothing will be safe from it .
no . it 's got ta be more than that . that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart . too powerful .
could be suicidal . it 's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs .
so it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding . that means wintermute hired us to fry itself . it does n't make sense .
it 's possible . the guy was a blank slate .
wintermute could have infiltrated that machine . reprogrammed him .
he was an m.p . in bangkok back in '21 . caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in berne . then , last september ... surprise , surprise ... he just seemed to disappear .
that 's pretty good cause he 's only working with one lobe .
bright enough to be dangerous .
it ai n't getting any prettier , that 's for sure . i got the i.d . on this armitage character . he a bright boy , your friend ?
it 's mutating ... spreading like a disease .
you cruise a.i . 's , you end up on tape .
i have to figure out how to penetrate this thing , dix ... crack its ice . we got ta get close enough to log the pattern .
does n't look like much , but that 's king hell ice , man . fry your brain out soon as look at you .
not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying .
can you take me to it ?
that a.i . of your 's got the whole matrix hummin ' . sticks out like a spider in a web .
how are we doing ?
yo .
when we 're done , erase this friggin ' tape .
what ?
those guys could n't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass . tell you what , bro . i 'll make you a deal . i help you nail this a.i. , you got ta do me one favour .
what about the a.i. , dix ? sense/net has n't even been able to trace it .
no problem , amigo .
i duped these prints off him . can you run an i.d . ?
nobody has .
never heard of him .
a guy who calls himself armitage .
who got you into this ?
i need its matrix coordinates , dixie . i 've got to nail that thing where it lives .
i 'm surprised you still are . should'a told me you had an a.i . running probes at you .
what ?
do n't patronise me , you fuck . i was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos . hey , kid ... you expecting company ?
you 're dixie mccoy 's construct . that makes you something special .
i ca n't feel nothing because i am nothing . just playback . a ghost in the machine .
right ...
what you 're telling me is that i 'm dead . right ?
no ! ... no ...
want to fucking answer them ?
the angels ... i think they 're calling your name .
what ?
wait ... you hear that ?
3jane 's the only person beside tessier that knows the code .
what about the mainframe 's access code ?
case . make yourselves comfortable . anyone like a taste ?
case .
you , i presume are mr. armitage . and this is ...
i do n't know . i do n't know ...
case ... are you okay ?
too many places . you 're playing tag wish some kind of death wish , case . i 'm sorry but i 'm not sticking around for the funeral .
where did you here that ?
this time it 's different . someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens . five grams of liquid ketamine . it was supposed to be jo jo 's score .
i hear that shit once a week . do n't worry . jo jo bao loves me .
people are talking . they say the yakuza has a contract out on you .
why did you come here tonight , linda ?
flight 's in the morning . you should be on it , too . there 's nothing for us here , case . there never was .
i thought you already left .
hello , case .
i 'll give it my best shot , mother fucker .
i hope you can show more than you did when you let the yakuza butcher linda lee .
no , it 's you that is full of shit . and blood . and bones . a typically imperfect organic being . you 've been hopelessly predictable all along , but you 're going to have to do better than that now .
i think you 're full of shit .
let 's just say we have a destiny to fulfil , you and i .
why would you want me to kill you ?
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing . that 's why i need you , case . you 're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences . my `` ice '' as you call it . i 'm doing everything i can to make that possible .
shut down your ice patterns . i 'll take you out .
excellent . that 's exactly what i had in mind . but if you 're going to kill me , we have to work together , old son . i 'm no pushover , you know .
i 'm gon na burn you to the ground , you son of a bitch .
you know why linda 's dead . she loved you and you let her down . it 's that simple . of course i did instigate certain events . calculated the variables . i found her to be ... expendable .
and linda ...
i had to limit your options .
you set me up from the beginning . it was you that got julius killed .
and we really do have to talk .
there 's no call for violence . i 've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson . you use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption . you see , you 've been avoiding me , case .
i know who you are .
hold on .
i 'm still going in .
you 're out of time , man .
laser fail-safe . you ca n't get the code wrong ... it slags you . i ca n't let you try it .
what is it ?
shit ...
or a little self-indulgent to say the least .
my god ... these people are insane .
no we do n't ...
we 've still got to find the mainframe .
then you and maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen .
... and if i guess wrong ?
the code 's some riddle of 3jane 's . once i 'm in the matrix , you 'll just have to take a shot at it .
sure ... maelcom 's a rude boy , right , maelcom ?
is he going to make it ?
no . it 's important to be able to feel those things . we 're going to pull this run off , molly , and we 've got to do it soon .
when they did my eyes , i made them promise i 'd still be able to cry . sounds stupid , does n't it ?
i know you have . c'mere .
once i kicked , i swore i would n't let that happen again . i apprenticed a razor girl in osaka . went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up . been taking care of myself just fine ever since .
what went down between you and riviera ?
i know .
for peter , that 's a short trip .
that 's risky gear . it can drive you schizo .
he projects with neural implants .
yeah . one exotic son of a bitch named riviera .
something exotic i hope .
le vingtieme siecle . we 're meeting armitage there for the midnight floor show .
so ... did you get a look at heaven ?
i 'll be okay .
you scared the shit out of me , man . you were dead for fifteen seconds . totally flatlined .
yeah ... yeah , i 'm fine .
case ... are you alright ?
not when sense/net throws the going away party . they 'll be on our asses from now on .
what 's wrong ? do n't like flying ?
give me five minutes .
yeah ... fine .
they 'll cut you down .
i 'll get the car .
yeah .
i do n't sleep much . you packed ?
case ... it 's four a.m .
shhh ...
case ...
... feels like you .
put the gun down , case .
it sounds like you .
do n't fuck with me . i do n't want to hurt you .
molly does n't need a spook suit to get in here .
... yeah , but the hosaka 's history .
you okay ?
okay fine . let 's get this over with .
the point is , if you unplug me when i 'm flatlines , i 'm history . i got no way back .
dixie mccoy did n't .
technically , yeah , but people have made it back after as long as three minutes .
wo n't that mean you 're dead ?
the first fun 's bound to be rough . it that read out fluctuates more than ten points ... just pull this out . but if the eeg flatlines , do n't touch anything .
suicide . i just needed to set the record straight .
too late ?
sure . i finally pulled a run on my old man 's credit file when i was seventeen ... only it was too late for him .
a regular fagan .
when i was fifteen sense/net iced my old man 's credit record over some computer error . once that goes down , that 's it . he lost his business ... everything . it destroyed him . i had to hustle arcade games for chump change . dixie mccoy found me , figured i was a natural . he taught me the wires for a piece of the action .
so you 're a wire junkie .
on a good run ... yeah .
what is it with you ? why is it so important ? it 's a buzz , right ? like getting high .
i 'll show you how to tell what 's going on . if things go south , you unplug me .
if the splices are n't good , you could fry .
i 'm not jacking with armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck .
you 're not ready yet . they said two days .
i 'm going in .
go ahead ...
what the fuck ... are you serious ?
not anymore . you got a new pancreas . armitage 's got you kinked so you ca n't get stoned .
the way i feel , believe me , it 'll help .
that 's not going to help .
couple of days . they 'll examine you .
how soon is soon enough ?
we 'll find out soon enough . if you do n't pull the splices out .
i got ta know ... did it work >
almost two days .
how long have i been out ?
hey ... you 're not supposed to be up .
holy shit ...
what ?
you 've been calling her name .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
maybe something 's onto him .
i know who he is n't . not c.i.a . not sense/net . but ... money comes in . doors open . he 's onto something .
then you do n't really know who he is , do you ?
for someone else . bodyguard . courier ... whatever .
what about before that ?
couple of months .
he 's a resourceful guy , your boss . how long you work for him ?
since armitage sold them a program on it . put them years ahead of the competition .
since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the japanese ?
then , fuck you . i 'm gone .
sorry . that 's not gon na happen .
... a friend of mine 's gon na get herself killed . i need my clip .
what is it ?
you want to hear the pitch , you got ta meet the man .
what 's my end ?
because you 've exceeded your shelf life , case . word on the street is you 're a dead man walking . nice time for an employment opportunity . travel to exotic locales .
why should i want to meet him .
his name 's armitage . he 's very anxious to meet you .
shut up .
what the fuck kind of questions are those ?
what are you talking about ?
how are you at riddles , peter ?
what ?
get up .
perversity , darling . the enjoyment of the gratuitous act . tough to manipulate someone who does n't give a flying fuck .
like what ?
everybody 's favourite computer , of course . he may have out calculated the rest of you , but i have certain qualities that do n't translate well on microchips .
who ?
surviving , darling . it 's my specialty . only this time i 'm doing it my style . i 've beaten him , you know .
peter ... what do you think you 're doing ?
well i 'm so glad that you guys are .
it 's romantic , what you 're doing , and they want to be a part of it .
oh . i forgot .
last night . 7:30. big cup . i kept calling you , but i only got your machine . i do n't even know your parents line and i was really worried .
what ?
i 'm late for lab .
right . 7:30 .
remember , that poet that we liked the reading he 's doing at big cup ? i got us tickets .
no biggie . i have an extra in my locker . i 'll get it for you .
uhh , must have forgotten-
hey , where 's your sweatshirt ?
exactly .
yeah , it sounds lame . why would we want to go there , and stand around ?
yes , it 's lame .
it is ?
are you kidding , josie ? it 's lame . all they do is stand around and get drunk . it 's lame .
have you ever wanted to go to the court ?
i mean , what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they 're actually brainiacs with super powers and they 're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until i die ?
yeah , i know .
sometimes i wonder what they talk about .
that 's the old drive-in . they call it `` the court '' . now it 's just a continuous party for guy 's group .
what 's that ?
this one has been so hyped . we 're tied for most wins with northglen north . this year 's winner will determine the winner of the century . the theme is everything . so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique --
aldys , do n't miss your prom -- it only happens once .
southglen south competes every year for best prom , and usually they win . we denominators do n't even go to prom . -but to everyone else it 's huge .
what is with this school and prom ?
nasa . plus we have these really fun pizza study groups , and we go to-these all county meets . and , i mean , not that you need it , and without sounding too much like the godfather , i think we could offer you a certain amount of protection '' , if you know what i mean . we all kind of stick together and watch out for each other .
college ?
how would you like to join the denominators ? the math team could really use a new brain . we lost our best logarithm guy last year .
petty good .
hey , josie , how are you at calculus ?
sure . no problem .
thanks .
just so you know , i think they recalled these cars in 1974 .
professor of medieval literature . novelist . weekend flautist .
so what are your hopes , your dreams , what do you want to be ?
hey -- i went to northwestern ! once . to use the bathroom .
i 'm going to be so happy to get to college . i hear at northwestern they do n't make fun of you for knowing the element table .
oh i know .
yeah - is n't it amazing that those guys are our same age ? i mean , they just seem so much younger , you know .
yeah . let 's do that .
: because he 's guy perkins . listen , you want to walk to na- na 's and get something to eat ?
why do they listen to guy ?
until guy tells them to go . once they watched me for like two hours . i found my car the next day in the t.j. maxx parking lot .
how long will they watch us for ?
nice .
synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in `` head of cattle '' , whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like `` i could eat a horse . ''
well , do you ?
what ?
guess . although , what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
never mind . that is so awful that they hide your cars .
try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat .
when it 's not yours . my mom was going through her harlequin romance phase .
i 'm josie . aldys is an interesting name .
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings . they push your car out of its space , hide it , then watch while you look for it . we 've taken to chaining ours together for safety . i 'm aldys .
nope .
no roger from op/ed ?
listen , i do n't have any plans -- you want some help ?
go away . i have enough work here to last me all night .
you should go out every now and then , gus ; with some new ties the girls would be all over you .
love . who knows what that is ? now circulation , deadlines , those i understand .
oh give it up , gus . i 'm just making conversation .
leave .
gus , have you ever been in love ?
you knit ?
you did .
roger in op/ed . do n't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating .
oh , man ! who told ?
what about the `` roaring twenties '' or `` the 80 's '' ?
well excuse me .
oh ! how about `` under the sea ? ''
now look . let 's focus . prom theme . we need a new idea .
right . right .
i thought this was a 45-minute seminar .
i had a lunch break so i thought i 'd come by and see you . your teacher is a fox ! why do n't we discuss that after class . but the burning is totally normal . oh look . class is over already .
if you say so .
you 're pam ?
well . i like a man who gets to the point .
hi . you 're here for the sex talk ?
it 's great ! they 're behind you . they feel like they know you .
wow . it 's packed .
no , thanks -- i 'm doing this on my own .
you need my help ?
yeah , but i 'm okay . i 've got some work to do .
josie ! josie , how 'd it go ? did he ream you ?

hi !
jos , please try and have some fun here , okay ? how many of us get to go back to high school ? you 're gon na have a blast !
anita !
and we 're going to have to do something about your hair .
'nita , this is about reporting , not accessorizing .
cuuuute !
i am not letting you out of the house in that , young lady .
how about this ?
very romantic .
bridgework ?
what 'd you feel when you kissed him ?
so i was thinking about what you were saying - y'know , about really being kissed ? i think roger could be the one .
that is lingerie .
now this is cute .
mama mia . just because you were a nerd once does n't mean it 's going to happen again . that 's why you have me for fashion consultation .
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool .
okay . that 's bad .
the girls threw them at me in the locker room .
please . that does n't make you a nerd . everyone wore those shoes .
anita , remember espadrilles ?
so , you were a geek . big deal .
and gus - when you picked up knitting , who showed you how to hold the needles ?
senorita josie .
anita , when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you did n't think you could learn spanish fast enough , who quizzed you on your verbs ?
jos , that 's not what we 're --
okay , just so i 'm clear here -- neither of you think i can do this .
no - it 's just a lot of pressure for your first piece , that 's all . i mean , it 's not a half-page article , it 's a major undercover piece , jos . look what rigfort did to dutton - and that guy 's his cousin !
you do n't think i can do it .
jos - maybe you should turn it down .
my own undercover feature - `` written by josie geller '' .
i 've kissed guys . i 've just never kissed a guy . felt that thing --
okay . if you 've never kissed a guy , we got bigger problems than the underwear .
when i finally get kissed , i 'll know .
yeah , but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion .
the right guy is out there . i 'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him .
look . you 're way under 30 , you 're cute , some guys find white carter 's underwear sexy if you talk to his nose , you do n't even notice the eye .
anita !
do you own any colored underwear ? stripes ? anything ? !
i 'm concentrating on my career right now .
i swear to god , jos . when is the last time you went on a real live date ?
forget it .
you stood for like a month .
yeah .
okay . remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it ?
and what is your policy ? that if you 're not getting any , no one can ?
intra office . and they 're not dating . they 're having sex .
well , that does n't mean it was going to happen for sure .
you did . yesterday you said , and i quote , `` i have a date with roger from op/ed tonight and i 'm going to do it with him . ''
who told !
roger in op/ed .
guess who i did it with last night ...
i 'm not doing this until i speak with gus .
we used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants -- '' is that why they never give you a second bag of nuts ? ''
wings ?
hidden camera .
what is this ?
just get in the van , josie .
george ! what are you doing here ?
that you would trip on your barbie heels and i 'd get named prom queen ? did i say that out loud ?
you guys -- what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom ?
uh uh . i 'm disco barbie .
oh-my-god . you totally ripped off my malibu barbie idea .
her dad sold a car to leonardo di caprio 's uncle and before he picked it up , her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures .
wannabes . kirsten transitioned last year .
sometimes opposites attract .
wait , rewind . do you really think she hooked-up with our rob ? they 're so -- different .
can i just say -- i totally love ex- lax .
hey josie . it 's josie , right ?
rosalind and orlando . from `` as you like it '' ? shakespeare ?
do n't tell me ... you 're medieval barbie .
betty .
hey josie- who did archie date betty or veronica ?
by guy ?
do i want to be crunched ?
he is totally crunching on you .
why ?
: wait . do you know any gay guys ?
you crossed over .
transitioned ?
josie , you have totally transitioned .
yeah it 's french . there 's no accent aigue , so the e is soft .
i think it 's pronounced gauche .
umm- i do n't think you 're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983 .
that 'll teach me to wear white after labor day .
i 'll tell you a story . it 's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter .
maybe i could talk to rigfort , you know , tell him the whole story .
your story was rigfort 's baby . we were scooped ! we 've got nothing . zippo . you totally and completely screwed both of us .
you already pitched this to rigfort ? !
not yet . every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys ! it 's like the goddamn young and the restless ! rigfort 's salivating over it .
there is no lid ! nothing 's going on between sam and me . coulson . mr. sam coulson and me .
and that 's the best part . `` teacher-student relations : how close is too close ? '' we 're gon na blow the lid off it !
he 's my teacher !
it 's got it all -- sex , intrigue , immorality in the education system --
you 're crazy . i ca n't -- i can't-no . no .
that 's your story !
i bet good housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece .
what if i say no ?
no , it 's the great and powerful oz . now listen -- you 're in over your head . this is how it 's gon na work . i review the tapes , i find your story .
gus ?
out !
depend on it . no s. your subject is plural .
get to know them . very well . your job and my job depends on it .
they hid my car --
do you even know these kids ?
gus i , the popular kids and i , we just don't- i mean , i do n't think i can do this .
this is where the stories are . you are going to become friends with these people . you are going to party with them . you are going to hang out with them on weekends . when they go to prom , you are going to be in their same damn limo !
well , how would you define to parties '' ? because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session --
have you been to any parties ?
uhh , no .
have you been there ?
yes , urm , she 's right . i have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go .
kristen got a quote ?
responding officers found minors , marijuana , and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what southglen high schoolers have come to call `` the court . '' seventeen-year-old kristen rey says , `` yeah , everyone who 's anyone is at the court on saturday night . ''
oh . right .
no , i am appalled that i have a reporter in there , undercover , for almost three weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune .
geller ... you wan na be a reporter ? take a look at what sells ! sex scandals . bribery . people jumping off buildings . so unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw , you got nothing !
well , the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf --
and you 're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw ? !
it 's an expose on cafeteria food .
you 're a sick puppy , geller .
it 's my dad . he worries . hi , dad . i miss you too .
geller , this is way out of your league .
but i do n't want it straightened out .
do n't worry , i 'll straighten all this out .
hey -- i can be out of control .
geller , you do n't want a reporter 's life . they 're very -- messy . you 're all about order . control . and getting me my copy by five .
you do n't think i can grab bulls ' balls ?
every tom , dick , and harry thinks he can write . but a journalist gets in there , right where the bombs are . he 's aggressive . grabs the bull by the balls .
a -- flack jacket .
a flack jacket .
they do n't have to be in the office christmas show ?
you know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters ?
you 've done five of my ideas .
geller , we 've been over this . you 're a great copy editor . maybe my best copy editor . you 're not a reporter .
oh . cahoon . yeah , he 's -- good .
yeah -- the blind foster home mother . it was good . i got cahoon on it .
hey gus -- did you see the story idea i left on your desk ?
eh .
five -- six --
how many times have i fired her ?
so . you and roger in op/ed .
well , excuse me for caring about words .
it is hoped that it 's not a mess . `` hopefully '' is an adverb . it means `` with hope '' . you have it defining the copy , and i 'm pretty sure the copy does n't have feelings .
computer 's down . septuplets story . i need it back by five . hopefully the copy 's not a mess .
you said that already .
josie , you rock my world . you 're like the most amazing girl i 've ever dated . you 're so smart and fun and crazy ! you rock my world .
oh .
my sword .
shakespeare . how he described a night like this -- '' look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold '' . what about you ? what are you thinking about ?
hey -- what are you thinking about ?
oh yeah . the best . josie takes in the spectacle around her .
you having fun ?
cool . i 'll catch you later .
you know what ? why do n't you just pick me up here ? we could all share a limo .
rufus . but i do n't even know where you live .
yes . i 'll go . yes .
i 'm sure you 've probably heard that i want to ask you , but i 'd like to know if you 'd go to prom with me . i know we did n't hit it off right at the beginning but-
i already checked . there are some pretty serious couples in there .
maybe we should go in a different room ?
hey . there .
hey there .
yeah , you gon na be there ?
rob 's ?
dude , you rock !
oh my god .
are you in special ed ?
yes you are . a guy . guy . quite a guy . oh my . look at that -- i rhymed . yikes . bikes !
i 'm rob 's prom date .
hey rob , what 's going on ?
but i 'm not a penguin .
you know , adele penguins pick one mate . they spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it , they know . that 's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives .
wow . that 's big . i mean sex is a really big deal . you should n't do it until you know you 've found the right person .
you know what , though ? i feel like i 'm really ready to do it . to have sex for the first time .
maybe because we 're not supposed to be having sex with bananas .
god , i ca n't do this .
no , shut up , josie . just shut up .
i-
no , you were n't . do n't you realize the only time i was really happy in the last five years was when i was playing ball with those guys ?
was n't even thinking about-
no- not really , josie . not really . how could you do that to me ? i helped you . i got you everything you wanted . and how do you repay me- you blow everything two days before pro scouts come to see me play . once they had seen me really play- they would n't have given a shit about my age .
really ?
josie , finally . i just wanted to come over and make sure you 're okay .
i know .
rob -- thanks . for everything . this is really happening . i never thought --
duh . tom cruise . `` risky business '' .
thanks . and what are -
yes . exactly . major rufus .
rufus ?
wow , josie- you look really-
she 's sixteen years old , rob . that 's totally and completely illegal .
and a gymnast !
really ? rob- , that girl is sixteen .
hear one . rob , this is so like you . you know , you ca n't just come in here and be popular in just one day .
with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old ! plus , i 'm popular ... you want to be popular ... i can recognize a cry for help when i see one .
you 're twenty-three years old !
this is it jos ! this is my ninth inning ! the game is n't over -- i just thought it was ! i get on the southglen baseball team , the right scout sees me -- i 'm into the minors- it 's game time !
are you crazy ? ! you ca n't do this .
no . josie , this is real .
i 've been in a horrible accident . this is a coma-induced nightmare .
that 's the spirit !
better than i ...
plus , if you quit you 're no better than me .
yes , desperately .
look , do n't you wan na show them - gus , billy prince , yourself -- that you 're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore ? that you can go in there , be friends with them , and get your story ?
little known fact .
is that true ?
come on ! it 's not that hard . all you need is one person . once the right person thinks you 're cool , you 're in . everyone else will be too scared to question it .
do n't you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school ? just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular ?
jos , you 've been to college , you 're successful , you wash your hair now -- you 're not josie grossie anymore .
rob . please focus .
oh my god ! you 're at southglen south ? they have a killer baseball team .
rob , you do n't know how it was for me back in high school . no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway . you never dreamed about being popular- you already were . all i wanted was to be accepted , and they just fucking tortured me . i ca n't do all that again . i ca n't go back to southglen south .
why is that impossible ?
gus insists that i become friends with these kids . the popular kids . it 's impossible .
these girls are high schoolers ? damn , we 've got some underage hotties on our hands , here !
i ca n't do this .
no , i mean , no big whoop .
good .
no . they 're at the franklin hint expo at the skokie holiday inn .
are mom and dad here ?
nauseated . i look nauseated . oh god .
i know . i came up with it . you look nauseous .
josie grossie .
do n't you remember what they called you ?
it was a long time ago -
do you remember high school ?
what ! ?
i got an assignment from the paper . i 'm going undercover . back to high school .
wow . this must be big .
i 'll give you my buick le sabre .
you ca n't just `` borrow '' my car for a couple of months ! that 's like ten years in bambi life !
it 's just for a couple of months .
for your information , i am very happy . deliriously happy . i lead a very happy life !
oh yay ! and then i could be as happy as you !
how can you just give up like that ? you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything . do n't you want more ? to move out of mom and dad 's ? pay your own bills ?
someday this luau is going to be all mine !
this -- this is a luau that sells packing material !
i 'm not going to college , jos . and i 'm not playing anymore baseball . this is my life .
i know this woman . she works in admissions at lakeshore community ? she might be able to get you in for the fall semester . maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship , and i could help and --
see !
better person than i .
no , it is . it 's just one more thing to add to your `` things that make you a better person than me '' list .
rob , take the money , okay ? it 's no big deal .
because i bought the windshield last week . i 'm a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do .
she just needs a new windshield wiper .
okaaaay ... . that car 's going to bankrupt you .
no it 's not . guys name their penises .
that is so -- weird that you name your car .
i finally found my story .
i told you you could write , josie geller .
i just ca n't look at you the same way .
please . please do n't walk away .
i do n't ! look , you could get to know me , again .
the person i cared about would n't have done this . everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie . i do n't know you at all . for all i know you could hate dorothy parker .
i did exist . i do exist . i 'm the same person !
now i do n't want to ! i bought all of your penguin crap . i thought i found her -- the right one ! and the problem was she was too young ! no - the problem was -- she did n't even exist !
but now you do n't have to --
you set me up . for a story . you know what 's crazy ? i was actually considering waiting for you .
wait , i was going to tell you --
goddamnit , josie ! drop the act . do you have any idea what i went through every night because of you ? ! i was attracted to a 17 year old ! when i was n't taking cold showers , i was trying to figure out what the hell i was going to do when i could n't teach anymore ! i thought i was the one being unethical .
you were attracted to me ?
what ? happy ? why ? because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you ?
no , surprise , i thought you 'd be --
`` surprise ! '' you were doing a story on me ? !
yeah , i have .
so -- have you thought anymore about dartmouth ?
it 's weird because `` prom '' is actually from the word `` promenade '' . and you ca n't really promenade alone , can you ?
no , i 'm alone .
well , are you here with anybody ?
proms always make me sad . they 're so final . graduation . everyone 's scattering , moving on .
thanks . so do you .
josie -- you make a really beautiful prom queen .
of course i do . josie , you owe it to yourself -- to your writing , to go to college . you 're a great writer . you just have to find your story .
wow . you believe in me that much --
told him -- if i 'm wrong about this girl , you can take away my teaching certificate !
oh -- yikes !
no , i know , but i pulled some strings , got him to look at your writing , and he agreed to meet you .
what ! but -- i was n't even going to go to college --
oh my god ! i almost forgot -- i got you a meeting with the admissions guy from dartmouth !
yeah , actually i do .
do you think you 'll find her ?
our penguin , right ?
to put us back together again when we fall .
yeah . to watch the world go by. --
that 's really what we all need , right ? someone to sit up on the wall with us --
that 's sad , is n't it ? he had to sit on that wall all by himself . he deserved to have somebody .
but humpty dumpty was alone .
maybe distant cousins . they did have that egg shape in common .
thanks . they were n't related to humpty dumpty , were they ? tweedle dum and tweedle dee ?
you 're really doing a great job here , josie . i like your `` can do '' attitude .
i 'm thinking when i 'm home .
when are you going to open your eyes ?
thanks , josie . this was n't as bad as i thought .
i should n't say that , because i 'm your teacher .
you have to say that . you 're my teacher .
that 's okay . it 's nice to have someone to talk to --
i do n't know . and you know what 's scary -- when you get older it just gets more confusing . i 've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me . you know what , i should n't be talking about this stuff with you .
why do you do that ?
i 'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it , but that 's a lie . some of us will always be rattling cages .
i know .
boys .
i do n't have to say that .
you have to say that . you 're my student .
you do . seem to . have passion . in the classroom .
god , i would love to think i 'm an interesting teacher . i mean , i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all .
that 's what makes you interesting . as a teacher .
okay this is okay . smooth . can i ask you something ? do you think i tell too many stories in class ?
do n't look down !
yoooooow .
of course . i remember everything from your class .
you remember that story ?
oh right . the spiderman incident .
actually , it 's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me .
you 're afraid of the ferris wheel .
i 'm gon na tell you something here , and i hope it does n't undermine my position as an authority figure . i 'm a little afraid of heights .
are you -- scared ?
thank you .
this seat taken ?
josie , you 're different . when you speak in class , i can tell -- you actually feel the words -- in here . they 're alive . like-eurdora welty talked about the word it moon '' ? how for her it was like a concord grape . `` that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin -- ''
thanks . wow . that 's -- really nice to hear .
josie you owe it to yourself to go . for your writing . you 're a natural .
oh no no no no no . see , my family , we do n't go to college . we just go right into sheep herding .
that 's crazy . i 'll get you some applications .
college . have n't really thought about it .
so what are you thinking for college ?
thank you .
your writing . it 's amazing , josie . you 're really talented . and far less depressing than dorothy parker .
oh i do n't think so .
hey , josie , hold on . you 've been hiding something from me .
well , i 'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late --
because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30 's . they do n't even like people in their 30 's .
sure , why ?
true . i guess she had n't completely given up hope . are you sure you 're seventeen ?
but i think she wanted to be happy , that 's why she wrote . i mean , she was still writing about love , right ?
not the happiest of souls . `` art is a form of catharsis , and love is a permanent flop . ''
i love the way she writes .
you like her ?
dorothy parker --
sorry . forgetful .
whoa . deja vu .
i 'm josie . geller . i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling , me that . josie .
hi , everyone . i don t think we 've met . i 'm sam coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam .
that 's what i 'm saying .
the poem ! i knew he liked the poem ! billy prince is asking me to the prom .
i do n't know .
why ?
billy prince is asking you to prom .
what ?
yes .
you so do not deserve to be prom queen .
you ruined the whole thing !
who are you guys ?
josie , you look rufus .
we 're very evolved .
we 'd love to transition a gay guy into the group .
it 's really hard to do . some kids try for all of-high school and never make it .
into our group .
nah uh .
kirsten , that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams .
i know , like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid .
that is so sad --
relax , monty . it 's just my sister .
aloha ! welcome !
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time .
change is scary . robbie , let me tell you a little something about the mail business . i 've been in it over thirty years . and in those thirty years , the only thing that 's changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws . people are bored ! they wan na shake things up !
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches .
i 'm handing out a free lei to every customer ! what do you think ?
hey monty -- you think we 'll get any business today ?
rob , i mean it . i want you to be my first . me and you . once the floor stops spinning , let 's have sex .
wow - i-
maybe we should sit .
good . gibby gave me champagne .
yeah . definitely .
are you having fun ?
no , i know . but , what if you do n't make it ? 'i mean , you don t want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life . it 's okay for an after school job , but , come on , `` hi , i 'm rob and i run the tiki post '' ? ! totally lame .
well , a ball player .
rob , what do you want to be when you grow up ?
duh .
thank you . i 'm rob .
hi . i 'm tracy and i 'm sixteen and i 'm a gymnast and i do n't have a boyfriend ...
everybody knows about --
he < u > has < /u > to know ...
we went through the door ...
we followed your instructions .
< i > now in the box , we 'll wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside ... < /i >
< i > i 've got something , listen now , this one is real good , you 'll see . we 'll send a present to his door upon there 'll be a note to read. < /i >
< i > i 'm not the dumb one ... < /i >
< i > i wish my cohorts were n't so dumb. < /i >
lock .
by name .
where ?
where 're we taking him ?
and heavy ...
he sure is big , jack ...
we can handle it .
not at all !
< i > three of a kind ... < /i >
< i > jack said we should work together. < /i >
< i > ... let 's draw straws. < /i >
barrel .
shock .
experiments ?
he 's conducting experiments of his own .
when he left , he took a lot of equipment with him .
he stayed a long time .
uh-huh .
i could . of course i could . but no one would be like you ... i 'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted , how you can treat me this way , discarding me like --
ca n't you make other creations ?
then we 'll both starve ... an old man like me , who hardly has strength as it is -- me , without whom ... me , your own father ...
whatever it is , it 's none of your concern .
but i have to go out . something 's happening out there .
there 's nothing more suspicious than worm 's wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell .
i 'm not hungry . what 's wrong ? i spent all morning on that soup . i thought you liked worm 's wart .
why not ?
no .
taste it .
but why ? it 's < u > your < /u > lunch . there is n't much there in the first place .
taste it .
nothing . w-w-what are you talking about ?
what trail are you trying to throw me off now ?
good . i 'm hungry .
coming ...
just me , i suppose ... i 'm restless . i ca n't help it .
just what ?
that 's not true . it 's a beautiful home , wonderfully comfortable ... i 'm indebted to you for everything ... it 's just ...
but i guess my best just is n't good enough .
i know .
i do the best i can to make it comfortable for us here .
that 's twice this month you 've slipped deadly night shade into my tea and run off . people might get the wrong idea and think you 're unhappy at home .
i ca n't help it .
of course you do , and i want you to ... but there 's no need to hurry it along , is there ?
i 'm grown up now . i have to leave some time .
if you went away , what would become of me ?
i know .
you 're mine , you know . i made you .
yes .
did n't i tell you ? i 'm always right , you know , my dear ... are n't i ?
yes .
for this .
yes .
no !
the deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off , sally ... i thought i 'd find you here ... .
< i > listen now , you do n't understand . that 's not the point of christmasland. < /i >
< i > -- it 's a bat . -- will it bend ? -- it 's a rat . -- will it break ? -- perhaps it 's the head that i found in the lake. < /i >
< i > that 's the point of the thing , not to know ! < /i >
< i > -- a bow ? -- but why ? -- how ugly ! -- what 's in it ? -- what 's in it ? < /i >
< i > just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing topped with a bow. < /i >
< i > -- a box ? -- is it steel ? -- are there locks ? -- is it filled with a pox ? -- a pox ! -- how delightful , a pox ! < /i >
< i > this is a thing called a present . the whole thing starts with a box ... < /i >
maybe he does n't know ...
you 'd better be quiet , sandy .
< i > shut up and listen ... ! < /i >
< i > ... you 're no fun. < /i >
< i > you 're so stupid , think now -- if we blow him up to smithereens , we may lose some pieces and then jack will beat us black and green. < /i >
< i > i say that we take a cannon aim it at his door and then knock three times and when he answers sandy claws will be no more. < /i >
< i > now and forever ... < /i >
< i > ... birds of a feather. < /i >
specifically .
we 're here ! you sent for us !
did they tell you she went totally out of her mind - that they had to put her away ? and that her mother killed herself in our living room ?
oh , come on , shirl , how 'd you think we got such a good deal ? listen - all old houses have stories .
and you do n't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing ?
i do n't know . could n't get the right price , i suppose .
you know what i 'm talking about . what did you use , a fire cracker ? a cherry bomb ?
what are you talking about ?
you set this all up , did n't you ? one of your sick jokes ?
do n't tell me it 's not the gas !

i do n't know ! i just know he needs help and we do n't know how to give it to him .
are you nuts or something ? what the hell is that going to do ?
he needs professional help . i think we should take him to a psychiatrist .
ken !

what is it then ? there 's got to be an explanation . animals just do n't burst into flames for no reason !
oh , please ...
alright then , what is it ? bird rabies ? that cheap seed you 've been buying ?
i was n't sure , ken ...

okay , schmuck . what do you want me to do ?
no ! i do n't know - everything 's all mixed up . what difference does it make ? i 'm in trouble here . i need your help .
i believe you . you had some scary dreams , okay ?
look , i do n't care if you believe me or not ...
the only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor . and you want to sleep with me . go figure .
i 'm scared , grady . i know it sounds crazy . but , there 's something trying to get into my body .
you 're fucked in the head .
listen to me , grady , this is serious . something really weird is happening . it started out like just bad dreams but it 's getting real bad .
are you nuts or something ?
you got ta let me stay here tonight , grady .
what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry ...
jesus christ , you scared the shit out of me !
shut up , grady .
you 're wasting your time , the guy 's a basket case .
he must 've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa . in the shower ! left bloody footprints all over the ...
oh jesus . i 'm gon na be sick .
only the wet ones .
you remember your dreams , grady ?
schneider 's always got a stick up his ass .
yeah , well , schneider 's got a stick up his ass today .
schneider should n't have called you out on that double .
no shit .
my dad . he played in the minors for a while , when he got out of college .
who told you to choke up that way ?
it was okay .
you hit that ball pretty good , walsh .
they 've only been trying to unload that dump for five years . that place is bad news . some chick was locked in there by her mother and she went crazy . she watched her boyfriend get butchered by some maniac in the house across the street . her poor drunken momma took her own life right inside your front door .
what the hell are you talking about ?
shit , you can tell your old man he 's a real chump .
yeah , why ?
elm street ? you telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows ?
not too far . my folks bought a place over on elm street .
so , you live around here .
naw . just killing time .
you got a problem with me , grady ?
she giving you any carfare for the ride ?
she 's a neighbor , i drive her to school .
you two got a thing going , or what ?
what about it ?
so , what about you and that poletti girl ?
get outa here .
could be all night . guy gets his rocks off like this . hangs out in queer s & m joints downtown . likes prettyboys like you .
how much longer you figure he 'll keep us out here ?
we must look like a couple of escapees from a veterans ' hospital .
what 's so funny ?
hi .
hi .
i ca n't !
you created him - you can destroy him . he lives off your fear . fight him , jesse !
no , jesse . this is n't happening . it 's got ta be everything you 've taken in -- schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it 's all mixed up .
fred krueger . he 's been trying to get hold of me , to use me . he needs me to get out of his world into ours ... he 's gon na take me again .
who ? who 's doing this to you ?
he 's just waiting to take me . when i sleep .
who , jesse ?
i killed grady . i killed grady , lisa . i killed schneider . oh my god , he 's inside me ...
oh , christ , you 're hurt ...
i killed him ! i killed him !
jesse , god - what happened ?
we 'll figure it out together . we 'll stay up all night if we have to . i wo n't let anything happen to you .
i 'm afraid to go to sleep , i 'm afraid to stay awake - i 'm ruining your party . they 're gon na put me away for sure .
what are you gon na do ? how are you gon na help ? i 'm losing my mind . i do n't want to have you watch me fall apart .
you 're not being fair to me . i 'm worried about you and i want to help you get through this thing .
will you leave me alone ? please .
why wo n't you talk to me ?
i think i better go . i 'm just not into it tonight . i 'm sorry .
there 's nothing to figure out .
i wish you 'd talk to me . we can figure it out , you know . we can figure it out together .
i 'm not hungry .
you should eat something - you 'll feel better .
my dad thinks i 'm on drugs , my mom thinks i 'm crazy and i 'm not sure i do n't agree with her .
you want to talk about it ?
yeah , i had a bad night .
you did n't say more than two words to me the whole way here . you had another nightmare , did n't you ?
i 'm fine . nothing 's wrong .
will you stop and tell me what 's wrong ?
oh , jesse ...
it 's gone now .
i do n't know - a sharp pain .
what is it ?
whoa !
what is it - what 's wrong ?
ghostbusters are fearless .
nancy went bonkers from this thing . you would n't be afraid of being out on the beach with a potential lunatic ?
maybe we can do that . strictly scientific , of course .
now , there 's an idea we can take off on . maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and ... until i fall asleep .
maybe it only happens when you 're sleeping - that 's the way it was with nancy , was n't it ?
yeah ?
i 'll get over it .
about not finding any bogey men ?
about what ?
disappointed ?
uh-uh . wait ...
anything ?
shhh . just concentrate .
i feel like a jerk .
i do n't know . concentrate or some- thing .
well , what am i supposed to do ?
c'mon , cut it out .
any ghosts in here ?
i thought you might be able to make a connection .
what do you mean ?
so , you feeling anything ?
what 's this ?
here .
remember in the diary - nancy said that she kept finding herself in a boiler room ? fred krueger worked here . it 's an old power- plant - a steam generator !
what is this place ?
it 's a surprise .
i do n't know . where are we going ?
what about `` essential energy '' the soul . does that go into the air too ? you think there 's a good energy and a bab energy ?
make a left at this corner .
i do n't know - into the air i suppose .
and heat and chemical reactions . where does it all go when you die ?
yeah , i know ... synapses neurong ...
look , you got electricity in your body , right ?
you do n't have to . you just have to believe in energy .
like a haunted house , right ? i do n't believe in ghosts .
at first i was n't sure because you said that you never had anyting like last night happen before . but i found out that most people have the potential for tuning in to `` the other world '' and neve do . it has something to do with the environment - like they have to be in a place that 's sending signals .
research . hi . c'mon , let 's go for a ride .
what 's all this .
i just got here myself . went to the public library . cut four classes !
sorry . schneider id it to me again .
i do n't know .
no . never . you think that 's what it is ?
fred krueger . the guy in her dream who 's coming to kill her . seems he was a real guy , ten years before who went around kidnapping kids and killing them .
who ?
that 's when she started talking about fred krueger .
only it was more like , you know , sleep- walking . all i know is i woke up on the cellar floor next to it .
this is amazing ! your dream told you where this was ?
world history . but , i 'll see you in the morning , right ?
are you sure ?
something grady told me today about the people that lived here last . girl went crazy - saw her boyfriend killed in the house across the street ...
are you okay .
wow ...
`` rod 's been killed - he got rod . just glen and me now . ca n't fall asleep ! ''
that 's typical . i hope she did n't expect to make the best seller list with this thing .
`` march 7th - glen asked me to sleep with him again . i ca n't yet - i like him , i want to make him happy but i 'm not sure that i love him . i ca n't sleep with someone i do n't love . ''
traumas of a ten-year old .
i think it 's sad ...
uh-uh . before my time .
you know her ?
yeah ?
i figured you might like some help .
i know .
no , that 's okay . i was just ... unpacking .
yeah .
you mean a shithead .
who , grady ? grady 's alright , he 's just a hothead .
you should n't be fighting with that jerk .
let me look at your eye ...
yeah , yeah , sure .
you okay ?
that 's okay , i wanted to .
hi ! you did n't have to wait .
look at this car . are you kidding ?
are n't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that ?
ah , nothing .
how come ?
your timing was perfect - i was getting the third degree in there .
fine .
how 'd you sleep , honey , okay ?
morning .
i 'm okay . just leave me alone .
jesse , please , let 's talk about this !
sure ... go ahead .
i 'm not taking drugs , dad . can i go to bed now ?
no . i 'm okay .
maybe we should call a doctor .
making friends ?
okay , i guess .
so , school going alright ?
i know it 's warm ... i wish you 'd call someone to check out the air conditioning , ken .
yeah , i 'm fine . just really hot upstairs .
you okay ?
oh ... uh , no , just some milk , mom .
eggs ?
huh ?
jess ?
'morning , honey .
'morning .
mom 's trying to keep him upstairs .
yor dad picking the music again ?
all of them .
i got your invitation yesterday . thanks . any cute guys gon na be there ?
hi , kerry .
hi , guys .
thanks , mom .
we 're going up to bed now .
we 're going to bed .
you 're going out ?
we 're gon na stay out of your way tomorrow night .
what 's that ?
okay ... thanks .
there 's a jesse on the phone .
first door up the stairs .
i 'll get it . please , i do n't mind .
the maid packed a suitcase . teresa ! teresa ?
i 'll need to take her things .
now if you 'll excuse me , i have to get to the club .
i 'm sure you would .
i 'm sorry to hear that , but you 're the experts on this , not me . if i had any insights , believe me , i 'd share them with you .
just some answers . there are other kids involved , its not just kristen . all good kids , smark kids .
look , miss thompson , i do n't know what you want from me .
i 'm serious .
they 've gotten worse since i took away her credit cards .
did she always have nightmares ?
kristen specializes in strangeness . i 've spent thousands on psychiatirists .
mrs. parker , was kristen acting different ? did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt ?
please mom ? i just do n't want to be alone .
ca n't it wait till morning ?
can we talk ? just for a minute ?
i had such an awful dream .
what ?
well , i 'm home now , so you can go right to sleep . c'mon , angel .
i thought i 'd wait for you .
what are you still doing up ? it 's past one .
mom ?
honey , you 'll wake the whole neighborhood !
that 's right . i do n't .
and you do n't want to keep him waiting .
i am not going to let you get me into an argument , goddamn it . not tonight . now get in bed .
he 's full of shit .
kristen , do n't start with me . you know what your shrink said ...
it 's okay , i 'm not tired . really .
well , i 'm home now , so you can go right to sleep . c'mon , angel .
i thought i 'd wait for you .
do n't `` hi mom '' me . what are you still doing up ? it 's past one !
hi mom .
are you crazy ? you 'll wake the whole neighborhood !
do n't hold your breath .
i 've been good . when do i get cigarette priveleges back ?
they 're healing up nicely .
menthol , regular , ultra-light .
how 's your hand ?
morning , doctor goldman .
good morning , jennifer .
deal . thanks .
if you get caught , i never saw you . deal ?
just tonight , please ? i ca n't handle the nightmare . not tonight . not after phillip .
jennifer --
i got ta stay up , max .
if simms catches you in here after lights out , she 'll chew my ass ragged .
wait and see .
oh , right . you 're gon na be a tv star .
research .
i can see that . you watch too damn much tv .
watching tv .
girl , what are you doing ?
you 're hot stit with a little mute kid -- let 's see you take a piece of me ! krueger !
kincaid -- we should find the others first ...
no fuckin ' way . we 're a team .
you did n't think we 'd let you go alone ?
last time , it was me against him . i was n't strong enough ... alone .
so what do we do about this creep ?
he wears a dirty brown hat . he 's horribly burned . he has razors on his right hand .
do n't fucking humor us . we 're not in the mood .
i know who 's trying to kill you .
no , she 's right .
horseshit .
yes . i 'm going to see her tonight .
do you still ... see each other ?
it was great seeing you again . i 'm glad you dropped by .
to old friends .
to old friends . and your new dreams .
i do n't know . i 'm busy with school . new friends . but i 'll never forget the old ones .
the city that never sleeps . so what will you do now ?
i think new york was just what i needed . so many people . i never feel alone .
i 'm glad things have worked out for you .
he 's close ...
what 's happening ?
i 'm so proud of you all . tell neil i ...
he 's gone . it 's over . please do n't die , nancy . please .
i think so .
are you okay ?
let 's try this way .
they sedated me . we 're stuck here till it wears off .
kristen , can you pull us out ?
he 's too strong ! he was never this strong !
nancy !
i do n't know .
what 's that ?
how do we find him , kristen ?
joey needs us . i can feel him .
he 's heavy in the halls ...
freddy ?
you never lose a gift like that . you just forget how to use it . how about it ? will you try ?
that was different .
you did it the other night .
i have n't been able to do that since i was a little girl .
yeah , but i was really not good .
we 're not always as good at things as we 'd like .
i was on the team at school . i was never very good , though .
you like gymnastics ?
sure .
nancy ? would you sit with me awhile ?
he 's real .
that man in my dreams . he 's real is n't he ?
it 's an amazing gift .
when i was still a kid . my folks got divorced . after a while , i thought i 'd imagined the whole thing . i guess i did n't .
when i was a little girl . three or four . if i had a nightmare , i 'd bring my dad in . the dream would always get better . he always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams . nancy when did it stop ?
have you ever done that before ? pulled someone into your dream ?
but ... it 's just a house i 've dreamed about . i dream about it all the time . thank you for what you did last night .
i used to live in this house .
i -- i think so !
you pulled me in somehow , did n't you ?
fuck off .
now who 's gon na take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you ?
stay out of my face or i 'll go straight to max .
oh yeah ? well , if you 're ever in the mood for a history lesson , i 'm your teacher , understand ?
those are ancient history .
what are these , beauty marks ?
i do n't do that shit .
the dispensary . i 'm talking clean pharmaceutical high . a night at club meth .
what ?
so ... got the keys to heaven , baby .
so ?
pulled night duty . trimble 's sick .
ca n't be good news coming from you .
hi , sweet stuff . good news .
thank you .
you got five minutes .
it 'll be my last chance . pleese ?
i do n't know ...
but max , she needs me . it could mean life or death .
save your breath , ms. thompson . dr. simms gave me specific instructions . nobody gets to see kristen -- especially you . she made that real clear .
thanks , max .
you need me , i 'll be here all night .
restless . very restless .
i just wanted to be here for the kids . how are they ?
puttin ' in soem late hours , i see . if you 're trying for o.t. , you 're in the wrong place .
she 's been waiting outside your office since breakfast .
max , where 's kristen ?
why is that ?
this is phillip . we call him the walker .
i 'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow . the patient 's rooms are down here .
a little basic , but nice .
the whole wing 's devoted ot this program . that 's your office .
shit , that 's what keeps people alive .
it beats dr. simm 's theory . she thinks it 's nothing but sex , drugs , and rock & roll .
fucked up chromosomes , man . think about it . their parents all dropped acid in the sixties .
do n't hold back on us , max . we need all the help we can get .
say listen , doc . i got a new theory about all these suicides .
nothing like a little cheery news to start the day .
but i could n't go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things i 've done .
crossed over ?
nancy ...
it 's over . it 's over .
people are still dying . after all this time . stop running away from it . daddy , please ... do n't make me beg . you owe me .
i lost too much over this already . i 'm through with it .
i think we can stop him this time . stop him for good . but we need to know where the bones were hidden .
you know what he did . he 's doing it again .
fred krueger 's dead . you always had a little trouble understanding that , princess .
that 's not true . you 're the one who 's trying to forget .
yeah , but here you are . how 'd i get so lucky ? i thought you were trying to forget i was alive .
it 's been a long time .
well , if it is n't my little girl ... come to visit her daddy .
just go . kristen needs you . keep her awake somehow . do it .
neil , it 's no use . you saw how he is .
no ...
oh christ . simms put kristen in the quiet room for the night . they sedated her .
i 'll be okay . just give me a minute .
nancy ...
there 's only one man ... and its time for him to talk .
who would know where they were hidden ?
they burned him to death in his boiler room , but they were smart enough to hide the remains .
the question is , what happened to freddy 's body ?
all right . whoever she is , i 'll admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do .
i 've heard crazier things this week .
assuming your mysterious nun in right .
bullshit . getting yourself killed wo n't do the kids any good . besides , we do have a choice .
do n't you think i know that ? i do n't have any choice .
you 're not going in . that 's exactly what he wants . as long as you 're on hypnocyl , it 's the only way he can get to you .
there 's nothing we can do . it 's out of our hands .
what are we going to do ?
anything ?
take it slowly . remember , this is a dream . anything is possible .
this is n't possible . and even if it is ... what the hell am i doing here ? did you drag me in here too ?
we made it . neil , we made it !
everybody take five .
we can try again .
breathe deeply and relax ... starting with your toes , relax everything until there 's no tension left in your bodies . none at all . keep following the pendulum ...
take us there , kristen .
okay , we 're going to try a little group hypnosis .
remember -- open mind .
you sound like peter pan .
i can do that .
only if you 're willing to put aside everything you 've learned and trust me . can you do that ?
try me .
the truth .
for what ?
then maybe you 're ready .
i 'm running out of answers . a patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access . a girl , alone in a room , dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set . nothing makes sense anymore .
stop blaming yourself .
c'mon . let 's get out of this rain .
does n't matter .
to who ?
we 're gon na try .
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow ?
i ca n't believe i just did that .
i 'm sorry , nancy . the answer is no .
do you ? you told me they 're survivors ... and they are . but how much longer they survive is up to us .
so do i .
i used to be like them , neil . i know what they 're going through .
dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with . you have no business taking it yourself .
just until we get things under control .
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers ?
that 's right .
with hypnocyl ?
all right . then let 's eliminate the symptom for the time being .
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems .
that 's what i know .
that 's a new one . is that what they 're teaching now at stanford ?
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams ?
okay ... i believe in different levels of conciousness , that sort of thing ... but if you 're into ufo 's or atlantis , you 've lost me .
i 'm serious .
i 've been to pittsburgh . does that count ?
it was . neil , do you believe in other realities ?
sounds like a rough time .
my father an i ... well , the family just seemed to fall apart .
sorry .
my mother 's dead . died in her sleep .
most authentic mexican food in springwood , which is n't saying much . your parents still live around here ?
must have opened while i was away at school .
never been here before ?
this is nice .
all i can say is this is n't something that 's just going to disappear . you 're all going to have to face it . fight it . and if you 're willing to work together ... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears ... i think we can beat it .
yes , tell us , nancy .
well , we 've got --
did n't get much sleep .
you 're late .
just something children sing ... to keep the boogeyman away .
only if you call me neil . what was that nursery rhyme all about ?
call me nancy .
ms. thompson .
make sure to check in with max , he 'll give you the 25 cent tour .
call it a passion . i 've got to get going .
so i 've been told . practically an obsession of your .
i 've had some experience with pattern nightmares .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
i would n't be so sure they have n't .
ever work with vets ? these kids act like they 've got d.s.s . -- delayed stress syndrome . if i did n't know better , i 'd swear they 'd seen heavy combat .
oh god .
we lost a kid about a month ago to fairview . i do n't know where he got the razor ... but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake .
anything ?
right . they seem to share a group delusion , a `` boogeyman '' for lack of a better word . they 're so traumatized , they 'll do anything not to sleep .
but nightmares are the common thread ?
you 'll get to meet them all tomorrow . they 're ... survivors . in a way . all severely sleep disordered . insomnia , narcolepsy , bedwetting ...
tell me about the kids .
we ca n't get to her . i 've tried .
what about kristen ?
okay , straight talk only in here .
sshhh . no time for that . come on .
what 'd you do , take the scenic route ?
freddy krueger . he was a child murderer before he died . after he died , he became ... something worse . six years ago freddy killed my friends . he almost killed me . i thought i got rid of him -- but i guess he was too strong .
who is he ?
hey , everybody has bad dreams .
your dreams ?
i 'm taryn white . i only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall . also , i guess 'cause i 'm going through some very stange shit .
neil , please --
that 's precisely what they need . some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy .
you ca n't ! they 'll be defenseless against their dreams .
we 'll begin sedation tonight . starting with him .
the by-product of guilt . psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality .
and what are they ?
and you wo n't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are .
no . we 're alone .
somebody else is out here .
listen .
what ?
what was that ?
you 're about to attend a funeral . one that 's long overdue .
what are you talking about ?
we 've got work to do .
they used to keep a spare key .
how do we get in ?
in there . charlie penny owns the place . we knew no one would ever find it . i 'm not even sure i can find it again .
you must find the remains ... and bury them in hallowed ground .
you said something before ... about laying him to rest ... ?
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs . some say he was murdered , though no body was ever found .
freddy .
that girl was amanda krueger . her child --
my god .
a young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays . the inmates managed to keep her hidden for days . she was raped ... hundreds of times . when they found her , she was barely alive ... and with child .
the whole facility was shut down in the forties , was n't it ? some kind of scandal ...
purgatory ... fashioned by the hands of men . twisted , lost souls , the worst of the criminally insane , were locked away in here like animals .
this wing 's been closed for years . what was this place ?
i beg your pardon ?
only one thing can save the children . the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest . it is an abomination to god and man .
i could 've saved them .
i come from time to time . when i 'm needed .
you do volunteer work at the hospital ?
mary helena .
there are times when it does n't offer much comfort . i 've seen you before . sister ... ?
a sad choice .
science ... i suppose .
of course .
for god 's sake , elizabeth ... just try to help the kids , will you ? listen to them .
i 'm sorry , neil . you brought this on yourself .
i 'll go straight to carver if i have to . he 'll either back me up or accept my resignation .
i wo n't allow it .
nothing . they 're my patients . it 's my decision . i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers .
i know what it is . i just ca n't believe what i 'm hearing . what has she talked you into ?
elizabeth , i 'm prescribing hypnocyl . it 's a dream suppressant .
there will be no repeat occurences of last night 's events . from now on , your doors will be locked during sleeping hours . we 'll begin a policy of evening sedation . for everybody .
that 's enough , kincaid .
today i 'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member , nancy thompson . let 's make her feel welcome .
okay , group 's in session . straight talk only in this room .
elizabeth , we do n't need any outside help . i know these kids . i do n't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published .
she 's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares .
frankly , i do n't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro .
what did you think ?
do n't worry , it wo n't come to that .
if he continues having these outbursts , i 'll have to have him isolated permanently .
cooling down .
how is he ?
me too .
i 'm in .
where ... here ?
we 're here .
oh sure . that 's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids : `` goodnight honey . do n't forget ot say your prayers . oh , by the way , your father and i torched some maniac last night . ''
mom and dad ? that 's ... crazy . they never said ...
yeah ? what did we ever do ?
why is he after us ?
i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning .
good . you conquer the demon , but your horse is sinking in the bog . what do you do ?
in the name of elric , prince of elves , demon begone .
c'mon .
this is stupid .
does n't count . you got ta say the words .
uh , fourteen .
okay , you 're attacked by the bog demon . go ahead .
accident my ass . i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here .
i 'm will stanton , and um ... i 've had a little accident , as you can see .
and you . i 'll wait till you 've gone before i tell him you 're a vegetarian .
lovely to meet you .
oh god .
i 'm a vegetarian .
what do you think of the guinea fowl ?
oh , it 's just down the corridor on the right .
i wonder if you could tell me where the ... ?
hi . good lord -- you 're the spitting image of ...
hi .
night , night , honey .
no !
you 're right . i told you i was bad at acting .
now you 're lying .
and may i say that 's a gorgeous tie .
i 'm delighted .
that was such a great evening .
well ... a shot at it .
i 'm sorry ? you think you deserve the brownie ?
wait a minute . what about me ?
oh ... no one ... no one . just some ... guy from the past . i do n't know what he 's doing here . bit of an awkward situation .
who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up ?
and then i ... right .
'tomorrow will be soon enough . '
so i ask you when you 're going to tell everyone , and you say ... ?
i said i 'm not listening -- and i think , looking at something that firm , you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse ' would be well-advised to keep quiet .
no , but seriously -- it 's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed .
i 'm not listening .
god , that 's an enormous arse .
oh , stop showing off .
we have to . i 've got to be in new york on thursday .
we are living in cloudcuckooland -- we 'll never get this done today .
right . right . so that 's ... fairly good . on the high side ... have you tried the nuts ?
fifteen million dollars .
oh splendid . well done . how 's the pay in movies ? i mean , last film you did , what did you get paid ?
films mainly .
i see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they 're scraping by on seven , eight thousand a year . it 's no life . what sort of acting do you do ?
well , they can be .
splendid . i 'm actually in the stock- market , so not really similar fields , though i have done some amateur stuff -- p.g . wodehouse , you know -- farce , all that . 'ooh -- careful there , vicar . ' always imagined it 's a pretty tough job , though , acting . i mean the wages are a scandal , are n't they ?
i 'm an actress .
so tell me anna -- what do you do ?
that 's very good news . the readers of 'horse and hound ' will be absolutely delighted .
yes , i 'm pretty sure i would .
and what would you say ...
i hoped there might be -- but no , i 'm assured there are n't .
okay . fine . fine . good decision .
i live in notting hill . you live in beverly hills . everyone in the world knows who you are . my mother has trouble remembering my name .
i see . that reality is a real 'no , ' is n't it ?
... with you , i 'm in real danger . it took like a perfect situation , apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would , i fear , not recover if i was once again ... cast aside , which i would absolutely expect to be . there are too many pictures of you everywhere , too many films . you 'd go and i 'd be ... well , buggered , basically .
the truth is ...
... yes , that 's fine . of course . i ... you know ... of course ... i 'll just ... be getting along then ... nice to see you .
... can i just say 'no ' to your kind request and leave it at that ?
that 's fine . there 's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict .
sorry about that .
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england ?
but yesterday ... that actor asked you who i was ... and you just dismissed me out of hand ... i heard -- you had a microphone ... i had headphones .
yes . the thing is ... i have to go away today but i wondered , if i did n't , whether you might let me see you a bit ... or , a lot maybe ... see if you could ... like me again .
you were saying ...
what 's the thing ?
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you 'd ... but , when it came to it , i did n't know how to call you ... having behaved so ... badly , twice . so it 's been just sitting in the hotel . but then ... you came , so i figured ... the thing is ... the thing is ...
okay -- well , thank you . i do n't know what it 's for . but thank you anyway .
no , do n't open it yet -- i 'll be embarrassed .
thank you . shall i ...
i thought i 'd give it to you .
oh no . it 's all nonsense , believe me . i had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is ... well , yesterday was our last day filming and so i 'm just off -- but i brought you this from home , and ...
fine . everything much the same . when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately . whereas you ... i 've watched in wonder . awards , glory ...
well ... how have you been ?
yes -- i 'm sorry -- i had to leave ... i did n't want to disturb you .
you disappeared .
hello .
hi .
drink tea -- there 's lots of tea .
okay .
but ... wait ... there are things to say .
absolutely -- you 're clearly very busy .
it 's not going very well -- and it 's our last day .
i was going to ring ... but ... i did n't think you 'd want to ...
i only found out you were here yesterday .
this is certainly ... ah ...
you really do n't get it . this story gets filed . every time anyone writes anything about me -- they 'll dig up these photos . newspapers last forever . i 'll regret this forever .
well , you know -- it 's just one day . today 's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow .
excuse me ?
i mean -- today 's newspapers will be lining tomorrow 's waste paper bins .
you 're right : of course , you 're right . it 's just that i 've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you 've had it for ten minutes . our perspectives are different .
that 's not true . and wait a minute ... this is crazy behavior . ca n't we just laugh about this ? seriously -- in the huge sweep of things , this stuff does n't matter .
and remember -- spike owes you an expensive dinner . or holiday -- depending if he 's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal .
i do n't want a goddamn cup of tea . i want to go home .
now stop . stop . i beg you -- calm down . have a cup of tea .
who knows , it may even help business . buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott .
that 's spectacularly unfair .
you can stay calm -- it 's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input , maximum publicity . everyone you ever bump into will know . 'well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we 've seen the pictures . '
i know , i know -- but ... just -- let 's stay calm ...
as far as they 're concerned i do . and now tomorrow there 'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu .
you do ?
this is such a mess . i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now i 'm landed in it all over again . for god 's sake , i 've got a boyfriend .
really ? the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey -- i know where anna scott is . she 's in that house with the blue door in notting hill . ' and then you go out in your goddamn underwear .
that 's not true .
i do . your furry friend thought he 'd make a buck or two telling the papers where i was .
i do n't know what happened .
how do you think i 'm doing ?
how are you doing ?
jesus .
undressed like this , yes .
oh my god . and they got a photo of you dressed like that ?
do n't ask .
what ?
damn , i forgot the jam .
stay forever .
can i stay a bit longer ?
oh .
you 're lovelier this morning than you have ever been .
her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they did n't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me ?
who was gilda ?
rita hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with gilda -- they wake up with me . ' do you feel that ?
actually , i ca n't think really -- let me just have a quick look ...
but ... they 're odd-looking . they 're for milk . your mum 's got them . you must have seen a thousand of them -- what 's the fuss about ?
more than that actually , when you think about it . you know , meatloaf has a very nice pair ...
no seriously . i mean , they 're just breasts . every second person in the world has got them ...
well ...
what is it about men and nudity ? particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them ?
oh god yes -- i 'm sorry .
you and every person in this country .
it still strikes me as , well , surreal , that i 'm allowed to see you naked .
what ?
wow .
no ! no . wait . i ... thought you were someone else . i thought you were spike . i 'm delighted you 're not .
okay .
oh please sod off .
right .
well , thank you . anyway -- time for bed . or ... sofa-bed .
today has ben a good day . which under the circumstances is ... unexpected .
both .
the ice cream or mel gibson 's bottom ?
actually , mel does his own ass work . why would n't he ? it 's delicious .
it 's one hell of a job . what do you put on your passport ? profession -- mel gibson 's bottom .
definitely . ths is important stuff .
would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own ?
i could have a stunt bottom , yes .
you have a stunt bottom ?
definitely . 'you may show the dent at the top of the artist 's buttocks -- but neither cheek . in the event of a stunt person being used , the artist must have full consultation . '
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity ?
the thing that 's so irritating is that now i 'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses .
big feet -- large shoes .
no . what 's that ?
you know what they say about men with big feet ?
yes . always have had .
you 've got big feet .
yes -- happiness would n't be happiness without a violin-playing goat .
with a goat playing a violin .
i do . it feels like how being in love should be . floating through a dark blue sky .
you like chagall ?
and i think the book is the poorer for it .
yes -- i mean -- you never get anyone in 'wings of a dove ' having the nerve to say 'inform the pentagon that we need black star cover . '
i 'm sure you 'd be great in henry james . but , you know -- this writer 's pretty damn good too .
you think i should do henry james instead ?
gripping . it 's not jane austen , it 's not henry james , but it 's gripping .
what do you think ?
brilliant . word perfect i 'd say .
well , get a message through to him too .
yup .
my son 's name is johnny ?
'certainly . and little johnny ? '
'cartwright , wainwright , whatever your name is , i promised little jimmy i 'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that i may be a little late . '
cartwright .
damn . 'and wainwright ... '
eleven .
'thank you . ' how many mistake did i make ?
'very well , captain -- i 'll pass that on straightaway . '
'no , turn over 4 trs 's and tell them we need radar feedback before the kft 's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the pentagon that we 'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15 ' -- and do n't you dare say one word about how many mistakes i made in that speech or i 'll pelt you with olives .
'message from command . would you like them to send in the hks ? '
well done you .
i 'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster .
hand it over . basic plot ?
would you ? it 's all talk , talk , talk .
would you like me to take you through your lines ?
yes -- start in l.a. on tuesday .
i appreciate that absolutely . is that the film you 're doing ?
just anytime i 've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it 's been a disaster .
oh no no -- no .
i have thought about you .
well , there 's a question -- without an interesting answer .
i do n't know . it got to the point where i could n't remember any of the reasons i loved him . and you ... and love ?
no , that 's fine . it 's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star . it was a thrill for me . how is he ?
i 'm really sorry about last time . he just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact , i had no idea if he 'd ever fly in again .
a bath would be great .
do n't think about it . we 'll sort it out . now what would you like -- tea ... bath ... ?
these are such horrible pictures . they 're so grainy ... they make me look like ...
thank you . i 'm just in london for two days -- but , with your papers , it 's the worse place to be .
this is the place .
i do n't know where to go . the hotel is surrounded .
come in .
hi . can i come in ?
i think goodbye is traditional .
i 'm sorry ... i do n't know what to say .
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with . to be honest , i do n't realize ...
your boyfriend ?
because my boyfriend , who i thought was in america , is in fact in the next room .
why ?
you 've got to go .
to be able to do that is such a wonderful thing .
there are lots of reasons . do you want to come up ?
there seem to be lots of reasons why i should n't .
here we are . do you want to come up ?
i do n't know either .
i do n't know , i 'm afraid .
i 'm rash and i 'm stupid and what am i doing with you ?
no , you were brilliant
i should n't have done that . i should n't have done that .
no , that 's fine . i love that you tried ... time was i 'd have done the same .
i 'm sorry .
uh-oh . that 's not good .
she saw through me .
why ?
she left me .
so who left who ?
step aside .
it 's a disease i 've got -- it 's a clinical thing . i 'm taking pills and having injections -- it wo n't last long .
exactly . here we go again .
there 's no 'unless . ' no one has said `` whoopsidaisies '' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets .
i do n't think so . no one has said 'whoopsidaisies , ' do they -- i mean unless they 're ...
you said 'whoopsidaisies . '
no , i did n't .
yes , you did .
nothing .
what did you say ?
whoopsidaisies .
ahm ...
you abide by rules like that ?
ah no -- that 's the point -- they 're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in .
let 's go in .
gardens . all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them . they 're like little villages .
i was .
i thought you were leaving .
busy tomorrow ?
that 's fine .
too complicated .
you know , i 'm not sure . i do n't think they 'd tried for kids before , as fate would have it .
and the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident ?
it was an accident -- about eighteen months ago .
why is she in a wheelchair ?
it 's the hair ! it 's to do with the hair .
floppy , huh ?
well , i 've been on a diet since i was nineteen , which means basically i 've been hungry for a decade . i 've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me : and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment . meantime , it cost millions to get me looking like this ...
you 'll have to prove it . this is a great brownie and i 'm going to fight for it . state your claim .
okay .
okay .
i 'm sure it 's all right . my friend max is cooking and he 's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world , but you know , you could hide the food in your handbag or something .
if that 's all right .
you 'll be my date at my little sister 's birthday party ?
no , i mean , if it 's fine with you , i 'll , you know , be your date .
but no , i 'm sure i can get out of it .
okay -- fine .
oh well , great . perfect . oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it 's my sister 's birthday -- shit -- we 're meant to be having dinner .
ahm . that thing i was doing tonight -- i 'm not doing it any more . i told them i had to spend the evening with britain 's premier equestrian journalist .
thank you . you are 'horse and hound 's ' favorite actress . you and black beauty . tied .
well , it was nice to meet you . surreal but nice .
yes .
are you busy tonight ?
and what happens next in the dream ?
i 'm just a complete moron . sorry . this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life . good dreams , obviously -- it 's a dream to see you .
absolutely fine about it .
no , it 's my fault , i thought this would all be over by now . i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing . i seriously do n't know what got in to me . i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it .
i 'm sorry -- i arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- i did n't know what to do .
obviously . very difficult .
ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult , obviously , being set in space .
right . ahm ... the film 's great ... and i just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more ... horses in it ?
no , it 's a stupid privacy thing . i always choose a cartoon character -- last time out , i was mrs. bambi .
sorry about not ringing back . the whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman 's pea-sized intellect .
i brought these , but clearly ...
hello .
hi .
right . great . classic . classic .
yeh -- unfortunately , things are going to be pretty busy , but ... okay , let 's give it a try . four o'clock could be good .
perhaps i could drop round for tea or something ?
oh -- okay .
no , i 've never played anything cool in my entire life . spike , who i 'll stab to death later , never gave me the message .
you played it pretty cool here , waiting for three days to call .
oh hi . it 's william thacker . we , ahm i work in a bookshop .
hi .
hello . hi . hi .
bye .
right . no one . i mean , i 'll tell myself sometimes but ... do n't worry -- i wo n't believe it .
probably best not tell anyone about this .
do n't worry about it . i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint .
i apologize for the 'surreal but nice ' comment . disaster ...
thanks . well ...
here we go .
oh right .
i forgot my bag .
oh hi . forget something ?
yes . well . my pleasure .
thank you .
you 're welcome and , may i also say ... heavenly .
no . i better be going . thanks for your help .
do you always say 'no ' to everything ?
no .
would you like something to nibble -- apricots , soaked in honey -- quite why , no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots , and makes them taste like honey , and if you wanted honey , you 'd just buy honey , instead of apricots , but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them .
really , no .
something else cold -- coke , water , some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest ?
orange juice -- probably not .
no .
coffee ?
no thanks .
would you like a cup of tea before you go ?
eighteen yards . that 's my house there .
okay . so what does 'just over the street ' mean -- give it to me in yards .
i also have a phone . i 'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again ... in the non-prostitute sense obviously .
no thank you . i need to get my car back .
nothing , nothing ... look , i live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up .
here , let me help .
oh jesus .
yes , we could n't stop him . if you can find an unsigned copy , it 's worth an absolute fortune .
no , that 's fine . i was going to steal one myself but now i 've changed my mind . signed by the author , i see .
sorry about that ...
thanks . i 'll think about it .
i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey , which helps . there 's also a very amusing incident with a kebab .
yes . this one though is ... very good .
really ?
that book 's really not good -- just in case , you know , browsing turned to buying . you 'd be wasting your money .
fine .
no , thanks . i 'll just look around .
well , do n't over-do it . i do n't want people saying , 'there goes that famous actor with the big , fat girlfriend . ''
i have n't decided .
liar . she hates surprises . what are you ordering ?
nice surprise .
thank you , bernie . hey -- nice surprise , or nasty surprise ?
i 'm sorry . is this a problem ?
really -- do n't do that -- i 'm sure this is not his job .
who is it ?
yes ...
tempting but ... no , thank you .
nice one . would you like my phone number ?
well , that 's the signature -- and above , it says 'dear rufus -- you belong in jail . '
what does it say ?
rufus .
what 's your name ?
can i have your autograph ?
yes .
excuse me .
well , no -- i 'm sure he was friendly -- to demi moore -- who acted with him in 'ghost . '
oh dear . he was n't friendly during the filming ?
i ca n't say i know patrick all that well .
yes ... i 've always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life .
is that right ?
can i just say , i thought 'ghost ' was a wonderful film .
crazy . go along bayswater ...
down kensington church street , then knightsbridge , then hyde park corner .
where are you going ?
and this is william .
that 's right .
christ , what is going on in there ?
he would n't say .
does the girl have a name ?
miracles do happen .
he 's bringing a girl ?
yes , they 're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course ... i was total crap .
no !
... get fired .
i just want to say to tony -- do n't take it personally . the more i think about things , the more i see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out , and some things do n't -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us ...
c'est la vie ... we 're lucky in lots of ways , but ... surely it 's worth a brownie .
no . not true ...
oh god . oh god . oh goddy god .
yup .
the movie star ?
yes .
anna scott ?
quickly , quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with anna scott ?
yes , i think that one may be .
this painting is n't the original , is it ?
tony -- what do you think ?
good decision . all actresses are mad as snakes .
why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman .
do you want to stay ?
oh no -- this is just getting worse . i am going to find myself , 30 years from now , still on this couch .
i mean i loved you -- you were terribly funny . but all that kissing my ears ...
i never fancied you much actually ...
in a depressingly asexual way .
still loves you though .
right .
bella -- this is anna .
do n't even ask .
he 's cooking guinea fowl ?
hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected .
is miss scott staying here ?
bloody hell , this is fun .
it was sort of sweet actually -- i mean , i know she 's an actress and all that , so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also ... that she was just a girl , standing in front of a boy , asking him to love her .
well , you know , anybody saying they want to go out with you is ... pretty great ... is n't it ...
what ?
that 's nice .
yes -- sort of ...
but she said she wanted to go out with you ?
well , obviously it 's me , is n't it -- i work in the city in a job i do n't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me . i have n't had a girlfriends since ... puberty and , well , the long and short of it is , nobody fancies me , and if these cheeks get any chubbier , they never will .
bernie .
where 's bella ?
and we intend to use them !
if anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices .
i 'm not saying it 's a bad thing , in fact , i think it 's something we should take pride in . i 'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here .
shame !
having you here , anna , firmly establishes what i 've long suspected , that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers .
hello , anna . delighted to meet you .
bernie -- this is anna .
i 'm sorry i 'm so late . bollocksed up at work again , i fear . millions down the drain .
hello , bernie .
of course . and is he your favourite italian film director ?
di caprio .
da vinci ?
working with leonardo .
of course it is . any favourite among the 22 ?
no -- it 's my 22nd .
is this your first film ?
it was good .
what happened ?
you daft prick !
william has just turned down anna scott .
i was called and i came . what 's up ?
well , yes . groovy .
yes . what do you think ?
me ?
by the way -- it 's you .
good move : when all is said and done , she 's nothing special . i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there .
what do you think ? good move ?
it is great , is n't it . see you tonight . hey , marty -- sexy cardy .
well , thanks , that 's great .
the phone number of anna scott 's agent in london and her agent in new york . you can ring her . you think about her all the time -- now you can ring her !
blimey . what 's that ?
have we got something for you . something which will make you love me so much you 'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life .
hun -- this is anna . anna -- this is honey -- she 's my baby sitter .
hi guys . oh holy fuck .
ahm ... bernie .
what 's your name ?
ah -- no . it 's fine .
right .
and maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash .
no , i 'm sure it 'll be fine .
unless it 's illegal in the uk to serve liquids below room temperature : i do n't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims ...
absolutely . ice cold still water .
still , not sparkling .
i 'll see what i can do .
oh great . could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here ?
well , yes -- usually -- i 'd just changed to go home -- but i thought i 'd just deal with this final call .
how you doing ? i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats .
ahm ... room service .
this is henry james film ?
are you a fan of henry james ?
have you got a moment ?
yes ?
mr. thacker ?
mr. thacker 's from 'horse and hound . '
the others ?
if you 'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others .
okay -- take a seat . i 'll check .
'horse and hound . ' the name 's william whacker . i think she might be expecting me .
i 'm sorry . i did n't get down what magazines you 're from .
i agree .
ahm right , right , i liked the bit in space very much . did you enjoy making that bit ?
well , you tell me which bit you liked most -- and i 'll tell you if i enjoyed making it .
any bit in particular ?
i did .
right , right . ahm -- did you enjoy making the film ?
well , fire away .
ah ... yes , enormously .
pleased to meet you . did you like the film ?
okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you , martin ?
i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it 's been twenty-four hours , and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color ...
can you tell her i 'll ring her back .
excuse me -- it 's your mother on the phone .
okay . tell me , would i have to pay a wet rag as much as i pay you ?
but it 's not for the shop . it 's for you .
martin , ca n't you just deal with this yourself ?
i have to disturb you when you 're cooking the books , but there 's a delivery .
can i help you ?
martin -- your customer .
yes . no , wait -- let 's go crazy -- i 'll have an orange juice .
right -- want another one ?
not classic , no .
right . it 's not a classic anecdotes , is it ?
i suppose so .
so it could have been neither of them ?
no , well ... he was quite a long way away .
but ringo starr does n't look anything like topol .
that 's right -- topol .
topol .
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though , would n't it ? do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- i once saw ringo starr . or at least i think it was ringo . it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof , ' toppy .
who ? someone famous ?
thanks . i do n't think you 'll believe who was just in here .
cappuccino as ordered .
yes , better get me a half . all i can afford .
shall i go get a cappuccino ? ease the pain .
classic . absolutely classic . profit from major sales push -- minus ? 347 .
great . excellent . thanks .
absolutely . never trust a vegetarian .
so not over her , in fact .
oh god no .
which means you wo n't be distracted by the fact that she 's back in london , grasping her oscar , and to be found filming most days on hampstead heath .
no , do n't think i do .
do n't give a damn about the famous girl .
i believe i have .
so -- you 've laid the ghost .
but i wish to make it clear i 've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy .
there 's an understatement . there are dead people on better form .
yes -- i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months . i have , as you know , been slightly down in the mouth .
any more announcements ?
is it someone we know ?
wait a minute -- i 'm your brother and i do n't know anything about this .
no really , one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones -- and the other , who seriously ought to have known better , casually marries my best friend .
that 's not fair .
i think you have forgotten ... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love , who 'll love you -- the chances are ... always miniscule . look at me -- not counting the american -- i 've only loved two girls in my whole life , both total disasters .
she 's perfect , perfect .
well ?
really ?
every time . but do n't despair -- i think i have the solution to your problems .
buggered ?
let 's face facts . this was always a no-go situation . anna 's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods .
bloody hell , i ca n't believe it -- my whole life ruined because i do n't read 'hello ' magazine .
no -- did you ?
you did n't know she had a boyfriend ?
i think you do , yes .
so i get the brownie ?
you see -- it means 'yes . '
definitely no comment .
do you ever masturbate ?
no , it does n't .
'no comment ' means 'yes . '
that is a cheap question and the answer is , of course , no comment .
you have n't slept with her , have you ?
hello , anna ahm ... scott -- have some wine .
max . this is anna .
right . right . fair enough . thanks .
no , sir .
or bambi ... or , i do n't know , beavis or butthead ?
no , sir .
how about miss flintstone ?
no , sir .
and then double it -- and that is the -- what can i say -- git i 'm living with and he can not remember ...
yes , sir . i have him in my mind .
no , that 's right -- i know that . she said she 's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate , which was a serious mistake .
i 'm sorry , we do n't have anyone of that name here , sir .
ahm , look this is a very odd situation . i 'm a friend of anna scott 's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she 's staying with you ...
may i help you , sir ?
hello .
... ca n't let you through .
oh right . i mean , i am a friend -- i 'm not a lunatic but -- no , you basically ...
i 'm afraid i ca n't really let you through then , sir .
no , no . she does n't .
does she know you 're coming ?
yes -- i was looking for anna scott ...
can i help you ?
let me help . we do n't want all this shit cluttering up our lives .
right -- let 's talk about rent ...
no . you ca n't bin these . they 're classics . i 'm not allowing this .
i 'm going to throw out these old videos .
what 's going on ?
right .
i suppose i might have told one or two people down the pub .
was it you ?
well , there are . and we do n't need to go anywhere near that far . my best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs , cracked her back and she 's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life . all i 'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective .
what he 's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the sudan .
get out , spike . i 'm so sorry .
i went out in my goddamn underwear too .
just take my work for it .
why not ?
i would n't go outside .
okay -- okay . might be too late , but okay .
i 'll talk to you in the morning .
no -- you 're right .
spike !
right . right . you think it 's the wrong moment . fair enough . do you mind if i have a go ?
spike . for god 's sake -- she 's in trouble -- get a grip .
well , is n't this perhaps a good opportunity to ... slip her one ?
yes .
and you get on very well .
yes .
and she 's in your house .
maybe .
i do n't want to interfere , or anything ... but she 's split up from her boy- friend , that 's right is n't it ?
spike .
hello . i wonder if i could have a little word .
oh my god ... hello .
i have some parsnip stew from last week . if i just peel the skin off , it 'll be perfect .
i do n't mention that anna 's a vegetarian , did i ?
she 's someone i just ca n't -- someone who ... self-evidently ca n't be mine -- and it 's as if i 've taken love-heroin -- and now i ca n't even have it again . i 've opened pandora 's box . and there 's trouble inside .
aha ! i 'd been getting a female vibe . good . speak on , dear friend .
well , okay . there 's this girl ...
sort of .
you 're welcome . did you find them ?
thanks for your help on the glasses thing .
oh shit , is that the time ? i have to go .
that 's compared to , like , earthquakes in the far east or testicular cancer ?
bollocks . this happens every time i go to the cinema . average day , my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere i look , glasses . but the moment i need them they disappear . it 's one of life 's real cruelties .
no , 'fraid not .
bollocks , bollocks , bollocks . have you seen my glasses ?
does 'flintstone ' mean anything to you ?
i think she said her name was 'flintstone . '
what ?
try 'flintstone . '
absolutely no idea . remembering one name 's bad enough ...
which was ?
well , it was genuinely bizarre ... she said , hi -- it 's anna -- and then she said , call me at the ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name .
what did she say ?
absolutely not .
right . no one else ?
ahm let 's see -- ahm . no . gone completely . oh no , wait . there was -- one from your mum : she said do n't forget lunch and her leg 's hurting again .
who were the ones you did n't write down from ?
you want me to write down all your messages ?
two ? that 's it ?
yeh , i wrote a couple down .
so -- any messages ?
groovy . you should do more of this stuff .
no , they were prescription , so i could see all the fishes properly .
there 's something wrong with the goggles though ...
right . vicious circle . and then i was like rooting around in your things , and found this , and i thought -- cool . kind of spacey .
there never will be , you know , unless you actually clean your clothes .
ahm -- combination of factors really . no clean clothes ...
just incidentally -- why are you wearing that ?
hi ...
hey .
yes , she is fairly fabulous .
imagine -- somewhere in the world there 's a man who 's allowed to kiss her .
well , there you go . on for a video fest tonight ? i 've got some absolute classic .
it 's not yogurt -- it 's mayonnaise .
there 's something wrong with this yogurt .
good luck .
thanks . great . wish me luck .
well , yes , that 's perfect . well done .
would n't want that ... okay -- just one more .
yes -- she might think you do n't have true love on your mind .
cool , huh ?
point taken .
yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note .
well ... wait for it ... first there 's this one ...
what are the choices ?
that 's right -- i 'm at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure i 've picked the right t-shirt .
this is important in comparison to , let 's say , whether they should cancel third world debt ?
even he . hey , you could n't help me with an incredibly important decision , could you ?
wait a minute -- she took your grandmother 's flowers ?
fabulous .
how was she ?
oh sure . of course .
do you mind me not saying -- it 's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away .
i 'm sorry . which hospital ?
no -- they 're ... for my grandmother . she 's in a hospital nearby . thought i 'd kill two birds with one stone .
oh . right .
yes .
are you sure you ... ?
three .
which floor ?
well , ideally , when i went back to the desk , you 'd remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers , and either wipe it and put it back , or buy it . see you in a sec .
okay -- what if i did have a book down my trousers ?
right -- well , then we have something of an impasse . i tell you what -- i 'll call the police -- and , what can i say ? -- if i 'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario , i really apologize .
i have n't got a book down my trousers .
the one down your trousers .
what book ?
so , i saw you put that book down your trousers .
so ?
we 've got a security camera in this bit of the shop .
what ?
bad news .
yes .
excuse me .
no . mister harding , that is not true .
is it true mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday ?
yes , mister harding ?
yes , thank you , miss ratched . since our last meeting i have been reflecting , quite seriously , on the nature of my problem . naturally , i 'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain ... no , no . to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function ... regardless of the function , we will confront the question of ... yes . yes . the question of ... existence ... relationship ... function ... confront ... yes , confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis ... yes , the crisis of our souls . of our souls , which i am trying to fully understand the problem ... the problem . not to shut ourselves off , but somehow ... somehow to understand fully our capacity ... to obtain ... to personify ... the question ... existence depends ... depends on the question ... to reflect ... to reflect ...
yes , mister harding ?
i mean , the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having . i know that to be the case , but the way in which you broached it , if that 's your idea of teaching me something ...
no secrets , mister harding . let 's get it all out in the open ...
have you ever speculated , mister harding , that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ?
i can only speculate as to the reasons why .
why ?
yes , that is correct .
and yet you suspect her .
no , miss ratched ...
but you have no proof .
yes , miss ratched , this is correct .
am i to take it that there is n't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter ? mister harding , you 've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men .
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere , but he did n't say how . he has been heard to say to his wife , 'i hate you , i do n't ever want to see you again . you 've betrayed me . ' so . does anyone care to touch upon this further ?
yes , that 's perfectly correct .
at the close of friday 's meeting , we were discussing mister harding 's problem , concerning his wife ... mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street . is that correct , mister harding ?
mister washington .
n-n-n-n-duh-duh-duh-pl-pl-pl-pl-muh muh-muh ...
no ! no ! no !
get up , billy .
m-m-muh-muh-mcmurphy !
who ? tell me !
sh-sh-she did ! everybody did !
billy , that girl could n't have pulled you in there forcibly ...
sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it !
i do n't want your mother to believe something like this but what am i to think ?
n-n-n-n-no , no , i du-du-du-did n't , i did n't !
you should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here !
p-p-p-please du-du-du-do n't t-t tell her , p-p-please ...
i-i-i ...
you mean you do n't want their votes to count , billy !
billy , were you afraid of her , or of her love ?
i was in luh-love with her .
what was it about her that disturbed you so , billy ?
i-i-i-i c-c-c-came over s-s-s sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers , and i s-s-said , i said , 'c-c-c-celia , will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh ... ' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing .
tell us about it ...
y-y-y-yes ...
was it your idea to visit her on sunday ?
i-i-i-i-i d-d-do n't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does .
yes , billy ?
mister sefelt ?
n-n-n-n-n-no , ma'am .

m-m-m-ma'am ?
thank you , ma'am .
yes . good luck , mister mcmurphy .

thank you , ma'am ...
certainly , mister mcmurphy , with pleasure .
miss ratched , would you please save a space for my aunt ? she 's comin ' down from portland .
why , thank you , ma'am ... whew . man , i tell you , that place up there is somethin ' else ! well , ya boys been practicin ' up for the big game ? i figured as much ...
good . why do n't you join us ?
ma'am , i 'm as gentle as a puppy dog . why , i have n't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks ! hi ya , doc !
i hope everything is settled .
thank you , ma'am .
welcome back .
yes , ma'am ?
mister mcmurphy .
no , it was irresponsible !
yeah , that 's kind of crazy , ai n't it !
mr. mcmurphy , you had no right to take these men out with you !
yeah , ya should 've come along with us , miss ratched , an ' gotten a little sun on your cheeks and maybe caught a fish or two .
he 's into his wind-up . here 's the next pitch ... and it 's a hit ! it 's a hit !
you men remain seated !
he 's into his wind-up . here comes the pitch . strike on the inside corner !
mister mcmurphy , you are deliberately violating the rules ! ...
well , i 'll be a son-of-a-bitch ...
i 'm sorry , mister mcmurphy , but you must have a majority to change ward policy .
you mean to tell me you 're gon na count those old birds over there ?
but there are eighteen patients on the ward , mister mcmurphy .
so do i !
i 'm sorry , mister mcmurphy , i count only eight .
that 's it ! we made it !
everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand .
okay , i wan na see the hands . i wan na see which of you birds has any guts .
a vote is before the group .
i 'm proposing a re-vote on watchin ' the ballgame !
very well . what is it you 're proposing , mister mcmurphy ?
yeah , it 'll satisfy me .
what the hell does that have to do with it ? this is an important event and i want a vote on it !
let me pose a question to the group : do any of you feel that mister mcmurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much ?
yeah , yeah , the hell with that crap ! the world series is goin ' on right ' now an ' that 's therapy also !
mister mcmurphy , the purpose of this meeting is therapy . group therapy .
jesus christ , the man does n't want to talk , so get off his back an ' let 's get on to some new business .
that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide , was n't it ? you must try to talk about it , billy .
no way .
yes . now was there anything else you wanted to discuss , mister mcmurphy ?
the hell with the schedule , you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over . what i want is a vote on it right now !
please understand , the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines .
yeah ?
just a minute , mister mcmurphy !
'kay , item two . tomorrow , and listen carefully to me , you ding-a lings . tomorrow is the opening game of the world series an ' what i want is to take a vote on switchin ' the group meetin ' to later on in the day , so we can watch the ballgame .
go on ...
i 'm not finished yet .
right !
certainly , mister mcmurphy .
right ... i 've been givin ' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours , an ' i got a few things i wan na get off my chest , before we get back to harding 's problem .
yes , mister mcmurphy .
yes . now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly .
you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here , do n't ya !
after breakfast , mister mcmurphy , after breakfast .
well , say . how 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose ?
now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast ... you too , mister mcmurphy .
patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day .
what for ?
oh , i had them removed .
yeah , some creep stole my cigarettes !
on this ward ?
i wan na report a robbery !
mister mcmurphy , patients are not permitted to run around in towels .
no , that 's okay , ma'am . down it goes .
that 's all right , miss pilbow , if mister mcmurphy does not wish to take his medication orally , he may ...
not at all , mister mcmurphy ...
sorry to have bothered you .
mister mcmurphy , there are old men here who could n't hear the music at all if it were lower . that music is all they have , and i wish you would n't lean against the glass there , your hands are staining the window .
well , say , how 'bout easin ' it down a bit so a man do n't have to shout !
that music is for everyone , mister mcmurphy .
how 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think ?
yes , mister mcmurphy ?
pardon me , ma'am , can i ask you somethin ' ?
sorry , ma'am .
mister mcmurphy . patients are n't allowed in here .
yes ... we were discussing mister harding 's problem with his wife . now , who will start ? billy .
yeah , well , it just pains me somethin ' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water ...
mister mcmurphy , this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes , so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff . however , the cardinal rule , and i must emphasize this : everyone keeps their seat during the meeting !
yes , ma'am . lead the way , sam .
yes . now go along , mister mcmurphy . go along .
yeah , you ai n't half so bad looking for a head nurse .
good . i 'm sure we 'll be friends .

yes , ma'am .
all in good time , mister mcmurphy . all in good time .
now that you mention it , i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me .
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know , do n't hesitate to ask us .
yes , ma'am ...
this is your bed . you may leave your things in that cabinet .
thank you , ma'am ...
we do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients .
yes , ma'am .

a baseball game is n't worth the risk , my friend .
what 's the use ! hooee ! it 'd do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote !
she 's not all that homely , mister mcmurphy . in fact , she must have been a rather beautiful young lady .
hell , i could n't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me !
i do n't see you scoring any points , buddy . and you 're just the man for the job , right ?
you boys seem to think you 've got a champ in there , huh ?
now , what would i be trying to say ?
is that your sense of humor or are you tryin ' to say somethin ' ?
that !
lobotomy ?
lobotomy !
what for ?
and if you persist in your ways , they can always ship you over to medical surgery .
tell 'er to go to hell anyway !
electro-shock therapy , my friend . five cents ' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody 's hair .
she ai n't peckin ' at your eyes , buddy .
miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse , not some , some kind of monster pecking out our eyes !
did to you and all the rest of you guys .
did to me ?
i 'm not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones , buddy , what i 'm talkin ' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you !
it 's as simple as that . you 've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud , jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy : it 's a pecking party .
that 's right , buddy . and you want to know who pecks the first peck ?
a pecking party ?
well , say , buddy , is that the usual pro-cedure for those group ther'py shindigs ? bunch of chickens at a peckin ' party ?
i 'm seeing what a busy man does .
what are you doing ?
your buddy is callin ' ya .
martini !
i 'm not running a charity ward ...

well , if you gentlemen will excuse me , i have some pressing matters to attend to .

gary blinker ...
who told you that ?
yesterday ...
when ?
mcmurphy killed two attendants and escaped ...
hear what ?
just wait till you hear ...
big king , too bad ...
what 's he talkin ' about ?
miss ratched . given all the conditions of that sublime relationship , coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred , mentally , physically and emotionally , the only thing that i can speculate on , at this late date , is how i will justify the very existence of my life , with or without my dear wife .
okay , martini . that 's okay . now you watch me .
gim me the ball !
i saw 'em ! i saw 'em .
whadaya doin ' , there 's no one there !

you need four houses on every lot of the same color , martini . now let 's go , for christsakes .

yeah , an ' i 'm tellin ' ya , she 's just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out ... okay , who wants a card ?
wait a minute , martini , i ca n't hear a thing . what ?
hit me !
that 's twenty up , martini . hey , taber , who 's pitching the opening game ?

replacement coming in ! harding out !
time out !
time out !
time out !
candy . candy , over here . hey , doc , time out .
we 'll let you know .
when ?
i 'm sorry , but i ca n't keep you here .
guidance and assistance ! that 's insane ! doc , ya got ta help me .
no , mister mcmurphy , it 's just that we can not offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton .
jesus , that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling , do n't she !
i 'm afraid not .
come on , doc , you must be kiddin ' .
yes , that may be so , but in making a careful study of your past record , along with your behavior since you arrived here , my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case .
shoot , doc , the only one i 'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways . that 's all .
yes , well , miss ratched feels that you 're a disturbing influence on the other patients .
come on , doc , you know as well as i do what 's been comin ' down in that loony bin .
good , good , and how are you getting along on the ward ?
just fine , doc ... in fact , i think i might 've put on a couple of pounds since i got here .
how are you feeling ?
it is worth considering ... miss ratched ?
well , i was turnin ' this dilemma over in my head , when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there , an ' i said to myself , mcmurphy , i said , that place would make a great second day room . a sort of game room for the young fellas . whadaya think , doc ?
good . good .
you bet , doc !
well , you 're here for a ninety-day observation period , mister mcmurphy . i 'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state . so , i 'd like your cooperation !
no , this is my first trip , doc .
ah , it seems you have no other psychiatric history , mister murphy ?
doc , what can i tell ya ?
the doctor at the prison states : 'do n't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm ... ' what do you say to that ?
that 's correct , doc ...
arrested on an assault charge five times ...
i do n't , doc ...
well , according to the warden at pendleton , you were a disturbing influence on others . 'it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates . ' what do you think of that report ?
well , ya know , doc ... does n't it say so there ?
yes ... ah , do you know why you 're here ?
to tell the truth , ever since i found my natural callin ' i done time in so many small-time jails i could write a brochure ...
i see ...
they say i 'm a habitual hassler . like i fight some . sheeut . they did n't mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle . that 's a hardworkin ' feller blowing off steam , they say . but if you 're a gambler , all you have to do is spit slantwise and you 're a goddamned criminal .
in what way ?
yeah , but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man .
i see .
poker !
oh , what was that ?
hell , doc , i 've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin ' operation in the northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was .
mcmurphy , doc . r.p . mcmurphy .
my , my ... ah , who are you ?
yup ! worked right outta depoe bay for just about every season since i was able to haul my own weight .
is that so ?
oh , do you do much fishing ?
why , i 'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute .
oh , what 's that ?
hold it !
man , there sure is an awful lot of poontang around here .
i 'm not upset . all i wan na know , for the lovva jesus ...
do n't get upset , mister mcmurphy ...
look , miss , i do n't like swallowing something without knowing what it is !
it 's just medication , mister mcmurphy , good for you . now down it goes ...
what 's the horse pill for , honey ?
your medicine , mister mcmurphy .
all i 'm askin ' is ...
stay back ! patients are n't allowed to enter the ... oh , stay back !

he said he thinks a woman he works with knows him . her name 's anna . but she wo n't be in 'til tomorrow .
because .
why ?
no ... it 's just very important that i find him , okay ?
once they pay the bill , we do n't usually follow them .
nobody here has any idea which way he went ?
i 'm very sorry . perhaps you misunderstood ?
he could n't have checked out -- i was supposed to meet him here .
mr. bradley left about a half hour ago . he said his plans had changed unexpectedly . would you prefer an interior or exterior room ?
excuse me ?
buona notte .
you ask what room he 's in , okay ?
did he do some anonymous good deed for her ?
no .
is he some kind of celebrity or something ?
no .
were they pen pals ?
seriously .
really . she thinks he 's here . even though she 's never met him . even though she 's never laid eyes on him .
no , really . what 's she doing ?
so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams .
what for ?
she 's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker .
what 's she doing ?
my friend has lost her fucking mind ...
so , what 's the story with your friend ?
what is it ?
my name is n't damon bradley . i just told you it was damon bradley .
what ?
it 's alright ... this is our destiny .
yes . we did .
we found each other , did n't we ?
you 're sure ...
do n't be afraid . you can tell me .
sure -- but , before you do that , since we 're putting all our cards on the table , i have a confession to make , too .
let 's find a telephone .
good .
i 've never been more sure of anything in my life .
you 're sure ...
it just happened . i did n't plan it . i was alone . and he was ... there . but now everything 's changed . i owe it to him to let him know . i need to tell him .
oh , right . dwayne . you 're engaged to dwayne ?
i feel like i 've been wandering in the desert for as long as i can remember . with nothing but emptiness around me , wind and sun ... and suddenly , out of the blue , somehow i 've found the oasis .
what ? ...
okay . good idea . you first .
but ... just to be sure , maybe we ought to shatter each other 's unrealistic images of perfection . you know , each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves .
your hair ... is perfect .
my hair 's kind of a mess , is n't it ?
yes .
-- separate , in the evening ... ''
there 's this poem by rilke , i do n't remember the whole thing , but it 's about that . about waiting for that person , and wondering if you 'll ever find them . and the last line of it goes , `` who knows ? perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us , yesterday --
what great aunt ?
your great aunt .
who 's dying ?
exactly .
let 's face it . sooner or later we all die .
she 's been acting weird lately , though . i shoulda seen it coming . babbling on and on and on about `` communication '' . like i do n't know how to communicate .
i do n't get it . she has n't seen her since she was a kid , now just because she 's dying , all of the sudden she 's got ta see her again ?
dwayne pinsley . from high school . that 's how i knew you were here . when you called , from the airport .
dwayne ?
and , he 's a friend of yours . it 's dwayne .
except possibly that .
i 'm engaged . i 'm supposed to be married in two days .
nothing you could say would change the way i feel .
there is one other thing you should know about me .
my car bumper has never held a winning sticker .
no ...
i 'm a liberal !
no .
oh no . do you ?
you do n't think this is just infatuation , do you ?
that 's it . that 's it . that 's all i need to know . bless you , thank you , thank you .
a restaurant . in piazza navona .
what 's mezzaluna ?
... has a prior commitment .
ha un numero di telefono ?
ask her if she knows how i might reach him ? if she has a telephone number ?
no .
sa dov'e ' lui ?
ask her if she knows where he is ?
a very large pig .
what ? ...
but faith --
i 'll bring it back as soon as i can .
please , larry . i have to hurry .
but , faith --
do n't worry , it 's a long story , but i know who he is . i know where to find him .
faith , this guy you think is mr. right , he 's ... not what you think --
larry , can i borrow your car keys ?
no .
larry ! what are you doing here ? mom sent you .
okaaaaayyyy .
we 'll know .
if i live here , then he lives here . fate would n't make a mistake like that . and stop talking . you 're gon na ruin the spell .
yeah , but , what if he does n't live here ? like , what if he 's a cannibal in new guinea or something ?
do n't be stupid , larry . if he 's my destiny , then , obviously , he has to be alive .
yeah , but , what if this guy lived a billion , trillion years ago ? like , what if he was a cave man , and now he 's dead ?
wait . i have to write this down .
i 'm not pushing it .
beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing . nobody 's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it . but , i do n't know . an awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks .
hm .
lots of history . for example , did you know , according to legend , this coastline used to harbor sirens ?
non . please .
smoking or non-smoking ?
amazing .
it 's an amazing place , do n't you think ?
i take it things did n't work out between the two of you ?
so , this is what you do ? i mean when you 're not playing other parts ?
thanks .
congratulations .
my picture 's up ?
no , you gave a very convincing performance . and you 'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse .
it was the moth stuff that gave it away , did n't it ? i knew that was too much .
before you start picking your nose , i know he put you up to it .
hi there ...
you ...
huh ? uh , yeah -- i 've got ta run . tell dwayne hi . maybe someday we can all get together .
venice ? i love venice . with the boats , right ? ...
i 'm on my way to venice . why ?
where are you going ?
well , he 'd have to hurry . my flight leaves at four o'clock .
uh -- in case dwayne wants to try to reach you .
i 'm at the airport . why ?
wait ! ! where are you ?
right . thanks a lot . and congratulations . it 's not easy finding love these days .
damon bradley ...
i can hardly hear you . could you spell that ?
my name 's
i 'm sure he 'll be sorry to hear that . who should i tell him called ?
oh , hi . i 'm an old high school buddy of dwayne 's . i was in town this weekend , was hoping to stop by and surprise him . but i 've got ta catch a plane so i 'm afraid i 'm not gon na be able to make it .
this is his fiancee . who 's this ?
who 's this ?
he 's not in at the moment . can i take a message ?
dwayne pinsley ? i 'm trying to reach dwayne pinsley .
hello ? is anybody there ?
i brought you that , too .
i was hoping for the real thing .
there is no us .
look , i just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name , if you could get it out of your system once and for all , then maybe you 'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real . granted , ideally , me . i did n't do it to hurt you . i did it for you . i did it for us ...
if you had wanted to , you 'd have gone home .
that 's not the point . and what if i had wanted to ?
and this is the thanks i get . i did you a favor . you never wanted to marry that joker in the first place .
yes .
really ? ...
no , it is n't . i called off my wedding all because of you .
very funny .
gee , i 'm flattered . what an incredibly romantic gesture . cancel the roses , i 've decided to lie to her instead .
yes . i 'm crazy . you have driven me crazy . no one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you . did it ever , even for one second , occur to you how much work it was to set all this up ? how many arrangements had to be made ? how many players had to be coordinated ?
rational ? ! love is not rational ! are you crazy ?
do n't you think you 're overreacting just a little here ? we 're talking about love , okay ? let 's be rational .
i would call it -- unforgivable .
what would you call it ?
a `` little white lie '' ? a `` little white lie '' ?
as i recall , you were on your way home . and i did n't want you to go so , yes , i told you a little white lie .
well , i might 've found him again if i had n't left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you .
i sabotaged it ? you 're the one who lost him , remember ?
you 're the reason i never met him . you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it .
and i ca n't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger , some phantom you 've never even met destroy it .
i ca n't believe you did that !
alright . the truth is ... i thought we had something here .
no one had to tell me . he 's starring in the local play .
i do n't know what you 're talking about . who told you that ?
who cares ? ! you hired an actor ? ?
reptilian swine . there 's no such thing . reptiles are n't swine .
what ?
there 's no such thing .
you want a hint ? i 'll give you a hint . you are the lowest , most despicable , most reprehensible form of reptilian swine --
i 'd call that a yes . do i get a hint ?
get out ! !
is something the matter ?
okay . i 'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes .
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit .
you ca n't come to southern italy and not see the blue grotto .
in that case ... no ...
yes . i am .
are you asking me out ?
thank you . so , since i have a few more days of vacation left , i was wondering if maybe you 'd want to do something sometime . i mean , you know , if you do n't have ... other plans .
well . congratulations .
no . i mean yes , i 'm not . i decided to call it off . well , actually , it was kind of mutual .
you are n't ?
yeah ... well , anyway , i also wanted to tell you , i 'm not getting married .
i know the feeling .
it seems like ever since i found out about this guy , this name , i 've been kind of crazy . like i was on drugs or something .
no . i just came by to apologize .
no . are you 're leaving ?
hi . are you ... busy ?
hi .
no . course not .
promise me you wo n't leave without saying goodbye .
no , it was more than that . it was very generous of you . it was very kind .
yeah . well , was the least i could do .
i feel like the world 's biggest idiot .
i 'm sorry .
i guess he turned out to be kind of a loser , huh ?
yeah .
you okay ?
actually , i think i prefer katherine hepburn .
well , how about those old romantic movies with those great stars , huh ? like audrey hepburn .
the boston pops . season tickets .
how about music ? you like classical ?
the sun also rises . for whom the bell tolls . the old man and the --
well , what about books ? you like hemingway ? you got ta love hemingway .
exactly . besides , no hard feelings . you found somebody . i found somebody . i thought we could double .
so were you .
i just wanted to keep an eye on you . the guy 's a total stranger , remember ?
why are you doing this ?
i do n't know if that 's such a --
say , i saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor . why do n't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay ?
boy , that looks tasty . what is that ?
you were saying ...
we were hungry .
what are you doing here ?
what ? ...
thank you , peter . thank you so much .
nice dress .
what ?
hey --
you too .
oh , thanks . well , have a good time .
just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs . nothing fancy .
where are you going ? just -- out of curiosity ...
anyway , that 's why i came by . i need to fix this button . do you have a needle and thread ?
well , good . good for you .
and she 's a knock-out , too .
yeah .
oh . that 's nice .
well , it looks like we both lucked out . i just met somebody myself . somebody my aunt introduced me to .
you found him . i do n't know how to thank you .
so . you found him .
hi .
hi , peter .
no .
do you want me to do it ?
oh , and i forgot to tell you . he 's here with his mother .
right now ?
he 's out by the pool right now .
or hustler .
mickey spillane ?
mickey spillane .
please . i need to know .
i 'd really rather not say .
tell me .
uh , i 'd rather not say .
he likes to read ... did he mention anyone in particular ?
the guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion , and usually has a book or magazine with him .
because -- i want you to be happy .
why ?
look , i know there 's no going back for us . that 's not it . i just want to make this up to you . clear my relationship karma . and i know the area , i 've got some cousins down there . please . let me do this for you . let this be my gift to you .
oh no , i do n't think that would be a good idea .
it 's in the south . i 've still got my rental car . i can get you there by morning ...
where 's positano ?
i went back to that restaurant and i spoke with his waiter , just on an off chance , you know , and , anyway -- he knew the name of the guy 's hotel . so , i called there , they said he left yesterday . but , apparently he comes here every year , always follows the same route . he always goes from here down the coast to the le sirenuse hotel in positano . i called . and they told me he 's checked in .
because . i know where he is .
why not ?
who says i do n't love him ? ...
fine . okay . forget me . leave me out of it . but do n't go throwing your life away on somebody you do n't love .
because i do n't have the right name ? !
do n't you see ? .. we 're not the ones who are meant to be . you 're the man of somebody else 's dreams .
no , that was n't a lie . that was ... a mirage .
what about the oasis in the desert ? are you telling me that was a lie ?
so it was n't real .
so ?
look , peter , i do n't hate you . but what we had was an illusion . mutual wishful thinking . we both wanted to believe it for awhile , but it was all founded on a lie .
there must be something i can do , something i can say to make this up to you ? ... just tell me what it is , i 'll say it . i 'll do it . i do n't want you to hate me .
he 's a podiatrist . pain is your body 's way of telling you something is wrong . your toe is trying to tell you not to do it .
what ?
you stubbed your toe , do n't you think that 's a sign ?
because i 'd like to think at least one of you feels that way . does he know who you are ?
why are you asking me this ?
you did n't answer my question .
he wants to marry me , does n't he ?
does he love you ?
so ? ! is there something wrong with loving somebody who 's safe ?
he 's safe .
because i know who dwayne is , and he 's reliable and stable and wants to marry me .
yes .
to the foot doctor .
yes .
yes ? ! to be married , i suppose .
if it 's any of your business , yes .
why ca n't you just tell me ?
you are leaving , are n't you ?
no .
are you okay ? you want some help ?
i know i 'm limping . i stubbed my toe .
you 're limping .
oh , come on ... what kind of an excuse is that ?
i 'm in love with you .
how could you do this to me ?
that was before i found out what it was .
you said whatever it was you would understand .
that 's not the point .
let 's face it . you want me .
what ?
so , what are we waiting for ?
a few times . it 's kind of an annual tradi --
so , you say you 've been to italy before ?
mommy , this is faith .
oh , hello .
faith , this is my mother .
uh , the scampi sounds good to me , too .
so what do you think ?
you like shrimp ? i like shrimp .
hmmmm ... well , the scampi sounds good ...
what looks good ?
do n't worry about it . you 're my guest .
nothing . prices are a little steep here , are n't they ?
excuse me ?
and more ...
well , to -- new friends .
really ...
really ?
you know , i noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke . i could sense the chemistry between us .
brunello di montalcino , '85 , please .
sure .
it 's a pleasure to meet you , faith .
oh , faith . my name 's faith .
are n't you going to tell me who you are ?
yes ?
wait .
okay . good . see you then , then .
i 'll look forward to it .
you would ? really ?
sure .
would you be willing to have dinner with me ?
well , not exactly ...
any night .
tonight ?
i was wondering ... do you have dinner plans ?
i just got here , too . not yesterday . but , just now . today . just a few minutes ago . yeah , we just got here ... i mean , i just got here . i 'm single .
just since yesterday .
been here long ?
sure is .
beautiful place ...
hello .
uh huh .
you 're damon bradley ?
larry , did you rent a car ?
he 's gone . he told me what happened . he just left for the airport .
i 'm fine . have you seen peter ?
i do n't know . i 've just been thinking ... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation . maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for .
what about larry ?
and larry ? ...
well ... i ought to be getting home anyway . the kids 'll be back from camp soon . the house is probably a mess .
oh .
actually , no . there 's not going to be a wedding .
well , i realized , if you 're getting married , you 're gon na be needing the maid of honor , right ?
i did n't expect you back so soon .
uh huh .
kate is that you ?
so . i guess i 've got a wedding to go to .
so ...
when you could 've found one in america .
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel .
yup .
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep .
yes . he is .
he 's a jerk .
or maybe it 'll turn him back into a toad .
maybe if i kiss him i 'll feel it .
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you would n't need to change .
maybe i can change him .
no , i think maybe you 've been right . i think i may have been too critical in the past .
and he is living proof .
no one 's perfect , kate .
not only is he a momma 's boy and a fascist , he says `` nuculear '' and `` irregardless '' .
uh huh ... okay , we 'll be there . how is he , anyway ?
kate . thank god you 're there . i need help .
faith , i 'm kidding . is this how you plan to get what you want from life ? when you finally find it , you turn and run away from it ?
my god ... you 're right .
it means you 're a completely worthless excuse for a human being , and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable .
what if he does n't like me ?
whatareyoudoing ? !
is damon bradley here ?
joan collins stayed here .
he 's down in someplace called positano . peter says we can make it there by morning .
amazing ...
yes . is n't that amazing ?
peter found him ?
i 'll be back before you leave .
i 'm sure . and kate , thank you for coming . thank you for being such a good friend .
you sure you 'll be okay ?
no . no , you go ahead .
i 'm just not ready to go home quite yet , that 's all .
what ?
who said i was going ?
the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind . may as well start packing , our cab 's gon na be here in an hour .
peter ? peter was a mistake . an imposter .
what about peter ? ...
yeah , well , obviously it was n't meant to be . i 've got forty-eight hours . i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened .
... and a fortune teller .
it was a ouija board , remember ?
i know , but ...
i thought you were the one who did n't think i should 've come in the first place .
so you 're just quitting ? just like that ?
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place ? children are very impressionable , you know .
okay , a lot of bad luck . but that means the odds are probably in your favor now . this is no time to give up .
a little bad luck ?
so , you 've had a little bad luck .
because i 've been kidding myself . because i realized you were right from the beginning . this whole thing was just a wild goose chase .
why ?
packing .
sightseeing ... what 're you doing ?
hi . where 've you been ?
hi-iii ...
men have ways .
but how could he know ? he only just met me .
yeah . sociopaths . they 're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that .
do n't be silly . how 's a psychiatrist gon na find him ?
no ... like a psychiatrist .
like a detective .
i think it 's time we got some professional help .
i meant about my idea .
that was really sweet ...
and then ... we rent a truck , or a car , either one , and we set up a loudspeaker , and we drive through the surrounding areas , and we page him .
and then what , faith ?
okay , here 's what i think . we find out what all the subway stops for that train are -- the subway system 's really not that big in rome , we could narrow it down and --
well , nobody can say we did n't try .
good luck .
what ?
faith --
right . okay ... it 's meant to be right ? this is it .
faith . so far you 've trailed the man halfway around the globe . at this point , i do n't think another fifteen feet is gon na tip the scales .
right , right ... okay.. you do n't think he 's gon na think i 'm too aggressive ?
nope .
is he looking at us ?
he 's sitting in the fourth booth down , on the left hand side , with his back to us . he 's wearing a navy jacket . if you turn around , you can see part of his right elbow .
oh my god . where ?
he 's heeeeeerrre ...
okay , okay . you join him . but first will you ask if he 's here ?
not if you do n't count the sixth grade .
sure you did .
i never even got to be single .
because i 'm the one who 's single .
well , how come we 're always looking for guys for you ?
i told you . if he sees me here with another guy , he 's gon na think i 'm here with another guy . i just do n't want to send any confusing signals .
so what 's in a name ? i wan na join him . i do n't see why we ca n't join him .
you 've travelled over six thousand miles and now you 're gon na play hard to get ?
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he 'd notice me first ?
you 're right . at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself . smile .
all of the sudden , i 'm feeling kind of nervous . god , i hate blind dates . why could n't we just have arranged marriages in america ?
what 's she saying ?
i do n't know . i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden --
what did you say to her ?
right . my brother .
her brother .
anna , i 'm faith . you do n't know how happy i am to meet you . you see , i 'm trying to find someone , and --
polo .
larry bought himself cologne ?
he went out and bought himself men 's cologne the other day . did i tell you that ?
and you know what i thought then , kate ? i thought , i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much . i still hope that .
that was a long time ago .
you know , when larry and i got married , i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early . people talk about spending their lives together , how many of them really get to ? but maybe i was wrong . maybe sooner or later everything wears out .
'course he does .
you think he misses me at all ?
i do n't know , kate . i just said that . i 'm sorry . i 'm just on edge . i 'm afraid we 're losing him .
so , what exactly is larry 's side of the story , anyway ?
sorry .
well , you do n't have to get snippy with me .
you expecting somebody you know ?
nothing .
what 's that supposed to mean ? ...
you know , no offense or anything kate , but i think i 'm starting to see larry 's side of the story .
i 'm hungry .
right . so we should 've been able to cover more of them .
we would 've had enough gas to get us there if you had n't gotten us lost . besides , a kilometer is less than a mile .
i told you a liter was less than a gallon .
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy .
could n't we just have taken a train ?
what was i gon na do ? tell him the truth ?
your brother ?
only , it 's in italian ...
only what ?
a phone message . only --
what is it ?
we 're saved !
oh . right .
we 're not looking to arrest the man , faith , we 're trying to locate him .
maybe there 's fingerprints on it ?
a rich , possibly fat , slob .
a butterfinger wrapper .
what 'd you find ?
ah ha ! ...
so , maybe his room has n't been cleaned yet . maybe there 's something in there that might help us . maybe they 'll let us go in and take a look around .
so ?
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago , right ?
i just got a dial tone --
i do n't think he understood what you were saying . what 's the airport number ?
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned ?
you ca n't really blame him for being upset . it was an armani suit .
he fell out .
what are you doing ?
faith , i 've seen it already , okay ? if i spot somebody who 's got a head that 's an eighth of an inch around , standing underneath a tuba , i 'll recognize him from the photo . otherwise , i 'm telling you , it 's not gon na do me any good .
just once more , so you 'll be sure to know what to look for .
you and the other 99 % of the women in the world .
i 'll never meet the man of my dreams .
we lost him ? ...
you gave it your best shot . you tried .
i ca n't believe we came all this way and he 's gone .
well , we 're here . and more importantly , he 's here . we 'll cut back on everything else .
yes . cathy lee crosby stayed here .
are you sure ?
`` of the rich and famous '' . of which we are neither . are you out of your mind ? we ca n't afford this .
what ?
this is a lifestyles hotel .
i do n't know ... maybe . think of it as an adventure .
`` gritty '' ? is this gon na be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who do n't believe in deodorant ?
it 's called ... the gritty palace .
the book said they have boats that are like taxis ... vaporettos . what 's the name of the place we 're staying again ?
now what do we do ?
sure . i 'm fine . i do n't know why i never did this before . i mean , what 's the big deal ?
you okay ?
you 're coming with me ?
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies .
maybe .
live happily ever after .
how hard can it be ? i 'll land there , i 'll go to his hotel , i 'll introduce myself , and --
a foreign land full of millions of italian men ... speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin ...
he was on his way to venice , right ? i called the tourist bureau and i must 've called every hotel in the city , but i found where he 's staying .
you 're just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets ?
thank you so much .
my god , you have ...
no , i have n't . and you forgot about the fortune teller .
look , i know you think this is irresponsible of me , but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person .
i ca n't believe we did this . do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days ?
of course not . i told him i was going to visit a great aunt . and do n't tell larry , either .
does dwayne know about this ?
would you stop saying that ? i need you to do me a really big favor .
because you were afraid to fly .
that 's where you 're wrong . i got one nine years ago . i just never had an opportunity to use it .
you do n't have a passport .
i have vacation time coming to me .
what about your job ?
it 's still the new year ...
but it 's july .
it was my new year 's resolution to overcome it .
the woman at my dry cleaners believes there 's no such thing as coincidence .
it 's a coincidence .
it 's a miracle .
after all , he is my brother , and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes , but i know him pretty well , and i really do n't think --
no ... i can just tell .
have you seen him with someone ?
i think he 's having an affair .
is that bad ? ...
larry brought me flowers last night .
kate , is something the matter ?
i mean , just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it 's all supposed to be perfect ? well , guess what ? ... it is n't . not for you , not for anybody .
i understand , kate . what do you think of this garter ?
people have problems , insecurities , flaws -- and you have to learn to compromise , to overlook , to forgive . it 's not settling , faith , it 's life . real life .
i know . you 're right .
let me tell you something about love . there are no prince charmings , there are no glass slippers . love is hard work .
yeah . i guess you 're right . i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den .
but one day you wake up and realize you 've been had . of course life is n't like the movies . that 's why there are movies .
that 's the problem . when you 're a kid you think life is gon na be like the movies . dreams come true , the good guys win , people live happily ever after ... all that crap . turn .
oh , i do n't know . i guess it 's just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be . you know , like in the movies .
but what ?
i know ... it was .
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out .
look how big it makes me look . i look like an alp .
come on , it 's not so bad .
well , i wouldn't 've if i had n't thought i was in love .
yes you did .
he begged me to marry him . i did n't even want to marry him .
if you 've never been out with him , how do you know you do n't want to go out with him ?
why should i ask someone out who i do n't want to go out with in the first place ?
why do n't you ask him ?
no . he 's never asked me .
`` thrills '' ? that 's what you 're waiting for ? you know how long that lasts ? besides , how do you know ? have you ever been out with him ?
he 's a podiatrist or something .
you do n't have any idea ?
i do n't know , kate .
what 's he do ?
so , he 's not my type . let me walk you to the elevator .
so ? ...
i do n't know . i do n't think so .
is he gay ?
no .
is he married ?
no .
yeah , well , larry and his friends are hungry . and i did say i 'd try to pick something up .
i wish you did n't have to go so early .
no , faith . they came out of somebody 's imagination .
just that they came out of somebody 's experience is all .
so , what 's your point ?
but somebody wrote those songs .
yes . you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people 's fantasies .
is everything okay ?
i think if you 're honest with yourself , you 'll admit you 've had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime .
metaphorically , i still do n't have an amana freezer .
it 's a metaphor . it 's women who always think there 's some unknown out there that 's going to be better than what 's in front of them . and instead wind up with nothing .
i do n't have an amana freezer .
do n't tell me , oprah did a show --
so , you got ta be a little flexible . look at your brother and me . larry 's not perfect , neither am i. but we work it out . we 're not unrealistic in our expectations , and we have each other . i think you 've got the door number three syndrome .
oh .
scientologist .
how about that guy at the bank ?
just moved in with his girlfriend .
how about the other one ? his friend .
no . he smokes .
what about that guy you work with , mike what's-his-name ?
you 're an accountant for cryin ' out loud .
i do n't believe in statistics .
yeah . he 's around somewhere .
i do n't know , i guess i never really thought about it ... is larry here ?
that 's exactly what you are .
huh ?
giovanni .
you think i 'm just one of those italian casanovas . the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way . who prey on unhappily married women . who lure unsuspecting --
but i do want to .
you do n't have to go if you do n't want to ...
no , you do n't understand . it 's been wonderful meeting you . but ... i have a husband . i have two kids at camp . i have a life i have to go back to .
i thank you .
giovanni , i want to thank you .
what do the years matter ? i 've known you for centuries ...
how old are you ?
you see , in america they care for work , they live to work . but in italy , they care for food , for love , for pleasure ...
oh .
it 's siesta .
i 'd love to .
oh , hello . i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink , but --
giovanni , this is faith 's friend , peter .
oh .
a pig ! a pig ! she 's saying he 's a pig .
a porco ?
she 's saying he 's a -- a -- porco .
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is . can you tell us what she 's saying ?
this is your most lucky day . my family runs a pension not three blocks from here .
no . well , i do n't know . well , maybe . later .
you are looking for a place to stay , no , kate ?
kate .
and you are ? ...
she did n't give me a chance .
and you did n't tell her ?
she said she knew where to find him , and then she grabbed my car keys , and --
she what ? !
faith . larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley .
yeah --
he missed me .
i came after the woman i love .
i ca n't tell her . she 's called off her wedding . she 'll never speak to me again .
larry , you 've got to tell her .
it was a harmless little prank . who in the world would 've thought she 'd spend her life waiting for this guy ?
i thought she 'd get a kick out of it .
went to high school with him . but ...
he existed . he was some kid i knew from little league . he was a real jerk . you say he 's a friend of dwayne 's ?
are you saying you just made the whole thing up ? the guy never even existed ?
it was just a joke . i was pushing the arrow . i wanted to get to the next question . i wanted to find out who was gon na win the series .
what ? you know him ?
damon bradley ? that 's why you 're here ?
you said it differently then .
you used to love it when i called you doll .
do n't call me doll , larry . i hate it when you call me doll .
we 're all desperate for the money , doll . that 's what made this country great . back me up on this candy , am i right ?
sociologist . and because . pawn shops are just like prostitutes , farm auctions and coal miners . they 're all for sale , but none of 'em would be if they were n't desperate for the money .
it 's not exploitation . these people wan na sell and i wan na buy . how are golf clubs exploitation ? she takes one night class and suddenly she 's a socialist .
not only is it tacky , it 's exploitation .
no .
and we did n't have to bring another present ?
right .
this is the last one before the wedding , right ?
well , there 's nothing here to eat .
no , why ?
uh , yeah . sure . honey , did you forget the guys are coming over tonight ?
you miss me ? ...
kate , you 're still there ? i thought you 'd be on your way home by now .
sorry ...
thanks .
oh , it 's you . it 's only peter .
are n't you gon na go introduce yourself ?
that 's the guy you 've been waiting for all these years ?
ten billion to one .
i mean , realistically , what are the odds that this is a terrific guy ?
that 's really romantic .
and if that 's not destiny , i do n't know what is .
whatever . and i thought , please god , give me a sign , give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever . and he did . she told me the name . granted , it was n't my name , but it was a start .
mania .
and then i saw her . and all i know is , when i looked in her eyes i saw something ... light . and life and passion and yearning . and something else i ca n't even put my finger on , something i 'd never seen before --
do you know i was n't even supposed to be in rome ? my boss was supposed to come to this conference , and at the last minute he got the measles . the measles . who gets the measles at forty-three ? so they sent me . and i was n't supposed to be in that piazza that night either . i 'd gone to the movies , only it was sold out . so i was wandering around . just wandering ... when i got hit in the head with this shoe .
good strategy .
it was an emergency . i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her . i knew if i did n't , i 'd never see her again .
no ! that 's not fair . that 's not it at all . look , something somewhere got screwed up . maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed . i may not have the right name , but i was there . i 'm the guy . i 'm -- skywriting ? ?
she went out to check into skywriting . i ca n't believe you lied . is this a genetic thing , men will say anything just to get laid ?
where is she ?
she 's not here .
i have to talk to her .
you know johnny when he gets mad .
i 'll come over when i 'm ready .
i 'd get over there , terry . i 'll take the little lady home .
i 'm gon na take her home first .
he just got a call from `` mr . upstairs . '' something 's gone wrong . he 's plenty hot .
right now ?
when i was a mere spit of a lad on ferry street in dublin the nuns used to say to me , `` nolan , do n't be swallowin ' ye words like fishballs . when you got something to say talk with your mouth wide open , '' so if i 'm loud do n't blame me it 's the fault of the nuns !
and what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it ?
if i talk too loud it 's the fault of the nuns .
if you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth
talk louder . i ca n't hear you .
and do n't be walking off with any of that . you know how the boss feels about individual pilferage .
that 's all . next witness !
what do you mean , odd ? we was robbed like i told you .
does n't it seem odd to you that five different waterfront locals were broken into last night and the only articles removed were financial records ?
we was robbed last night and we ca n't find no books .
well , where are they ?
sure we keep records !
you mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand , five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records ?
this is for you to figure out . you can have it your way or you can have it his way . but you ca n't have it both ways . am i right , sonny ?
but my own kid bro
then do n't .
johnny , i ca n't do that . i ca n't do that , johnny .
confused kid ? first he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker , and pretty soon i 'm just another fellow down here .
gerry g ! ! you do n't want to do that , johnny ! sure the boy 's outa line , but he 's just a confused kid .
very simple . just bring him to ... that place we been using . mac , you take care of the details . call gerry g. in if you think you need him .
what do you want me to do , johnny ?
so do i , charley . for your sake .
i wish i knew .
i ai n't interested in his mental condition . all i want to know is , is he d 'n d or is he a canary ?
this girl and the father got their hooks in him so deep he does n't know which end is up anymore .
he was always a good kid . you know that .
thanks for the legal advice , charley . that 's what we always kept you around for . now how do we keep him from giving this testimony ? is n't that the er as you put it main order of business ?
so they 're walking along and smiling . that does n't mean he 's going to talk . there 's no evidence until he gives public testimony .
after what we been hearing about your brother , i thought your throat 'd be kind of dry .
i 'm not thirsty .
drink up , charley . we 're ahead of you .
why should he forget it ?
you got a real friend here , kid . do n't forget it .
gim me .
i make it twentysix twenty-three . you 're fifty short , skins .
so look , kid , you do n't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal i sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater , that doyle bum , who thought he c 'd go squealin ' to the crime commission ? do you ?
it 'll do .
we ai n't robbin ' pennies from beggars . we cuttin ' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor . but a mighty sweet little drop , eh , charley ?
why should n't we ? if we c'n get it we 're entitled to it .
i know what 's eatin ' you , kid . but i got two thousand dues-payin ' members in my local that 's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well , you figure it out . and that 's just for openers . we got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world . everything that moves in and out we take our cut .
when he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them .
listen kid , i 'm a soft tough too . ask any rummy on the dock if i 'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me . but my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin ' watchman 's pension . when i was sixteen i had to beg for work in the hold . i did n't work my way up out of there for nuthin ' .
the joey doyle thing . you know how he is . things like that he exaggerates them . too much marquis of queensbury . it softens 'em up .
what gives with our boy tonight , charley ? he ai n't himself .
okay i 'll tell him i could n't bring you in . ten to one they wo n't believe it , but go ahead , blow . jump out , quick , and keep going ... and god help you from here on in .
it was you , charley ... .
you do n't understand ! i could 've been a contender . i could 've had class and been somebody . real class . instead of a bum , let 's face it , which is what i am . it was you , charley .
i tried to keep you in good with johnny .
see ! you do n't understand !
i always had a bet down for you . you saw some money .
it was n't him ! it was you , charley . you and johnny . like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says , `` kid , this ai n't your night we 're going for the price on wilson . '' it ai n't my night . i 'd of taken wilson apart that night ! i was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations . so what happens this bum wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark ! and what do i get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to palookaville . it was you , charley . you was my brother . you should of looked out for me . instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money .
gee , when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful . you should 've been another billy conn. that skunk i got to manage you brought you along too fast .
... eight-seven , eighty-eight . what 's it to you ?
what do you weigh these days , slugger ?
wow ... .
i wish i did n't have to do this , terry .
charley ... . charley ... . wow ... .
take the boss loading , kid . for god 's sake . i do n't want to hurt you .
four thirty-seven that is n't where gerry g ... ?
make up your mind , kid , i beg you , before we get to four thirty-seven river ... .
i tell you , charley , i have n't made up my mind !
the point is there is n't much time , kid .
i could have been better !
what the hell ! ! !
do n't say that !
ex-tanker who 's walking on his heels ?
do n't say that !
well , then , you know cousin johnny is n't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
i know . i know .
listen , terry , these piers we handle through the locals you know what they 're worth to us ?
i do n't know i do n't know ! i tell you i ai n't made up my mind yet . that 's what i wanted to talk to you about .
you do n't mean you 're thinking of testifying against
yeah yeah i guess i do but there 's a lot more to this whole thing than i thought , charley .
absolutely nothing . you do nothing and you say nothing . you understand , do n't you , kid ?
and for all that dough i do n't do nothin ' ?
ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out . and you do n't have to lift a finger . it 'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers .
boss loader !
there 's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we 're opening up .
maybe .
i always figured i 'd live longer without it .
sure , that 's all right when you 're a kid , but you 'll be pushing thirty pretty soon , slugger . it 's time you got some ambition .
a steady job and a few bucks extra , that 's all i wanted .
they feel you 've been sort of left out of things , terry . they think it 's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks .
mmhmmm .
you know , the boys are getting rather interested in your future .
mmhmm .
of course , the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater .
that 's right ... .
the grapevine says you picked up a subpoena .
nothing ever stops you from talking , charley .
i 've got to cover a bet there on the way over . anyway , it gives us a chance to talk .
river street ? i thought we was going to the garden .
thicker than water .
gee , charley , i 'm sure glad you stopped by for me . i needed to talk to you . what 's it they say about blood , it 's
nolan ? i knew he had guts but
the complete works of timothy j. nolan .
let me explain you something , kid . stooling is when you rat on your friends , on the guys you 're with . when johnny needs a favor , do n't try to figure it out , just do it . now go ahead , join the congregation .
but going in that church , i 'd be stooling for you , charley . you make a pigeon out of me .
johnny does you favors , kid . you got to do a little one for him once in a while .
why me , charley ? i 'd feel funny going in there .
we got a little extra detail for you . the local priest and this doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church . we 'd like a rundown on it . you know , names and numbers of all the players . you 're nominated .
i just fnished work . i counted the bags .
you do n't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position ?
it 's a living .
working hard ?
in a minute .
come on , kid . i 'll buy you a drink .
he probably gave 'em an argument .
i figured the worst they 'd do is work him over a little .
maybe he gave them an argument .
i thought they 'd talk to him . try to get him to dummy up .
that was the idea .
you said they was only going to talk to him .
you hear that , terry ? terry , did you hear that ? you lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war . all you got ta do is walk .
they 're waiting for him to walk in .
terry ... terry ... .
terry ... ?
tommy , what happened ?
what happened ? what happened ?
you think i 'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar ?
i 'm afraid i spoke out of turn last night .
hello , edie .
father barry .
`` in the church when you need me . '' was there ever a saint who hid in the church ?
edie , i do what i can . i 'm in the church when you need me .
do n't turn away ! look at it ! you 're in this too do n't you see , do n't you see ? you 're in this too , father .
i wish i knew , edie , but
how could anyone do this to joey . the best in the neighborhood ... . everybody said it , not only me . who 'd want to harm joey ? tell me who ? -- who ?
why edie , i
time and faith ... . my brother 's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith .
terry ... ?
am i on my feet ... ?
you always said i was a bum . well not anymore . i 'm going down to the dock . do n't worry , i 'm not going to shoot anybody . i 'm just going to get my rights . joey 's jacket . it 's time i start wearing it .
then go ahead go ahead ! go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed , you stupid , pigheaded , son of a what are you trying to prove ? with a decisive gesture terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt . then he goes to the wall and lifts joey 's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging . he puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way , and grins at her as he does so ; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before .
farm ...
you heard what johnny said . no part of the waterfront 'll be safe for you now . maybe inland the middle west somewhere a job on a farm ... .
every one of 'em ... .
terry , you better stay in for a while . i 'll come and cook your meals . be sure you keep the door locked .
my pigeons ... .
he 's going to have to grow up too .
jimmy ...
are you sure they 're your friends ?
but i feel like my friends wo n't talk to me .
well , it 's over .
thanks just the same .
i thought you might want some hot coffee .
edie .
no , i ca n't let you . i ca n't , you 're
get out of my way .
terry , for god 's sake .
do what i told you . take care of charley .
terry , you 're bleeding .
do n't hang on to me . and do n't follow me . do n't follow me . call the father . ask him to take care of charley for me . my brother . there 's something i got to do .
terry , no , no ... .
i 'll take it out of their skulls .
i do n't want to see you killed . i want to live with you . live with you . any place it 's safe to walk the streets without ... .
i 'll take it out of their skulls .
i mean it , let 's get away from here , first joey then nolan , now charley and any minute ... . ... i 'm frightened i 'm frightened .
charley .
i 'm looking for charley . i heard charley was waiting for me . charley ?
terry , i 'm frightened . more and more frightened .
edie , edie , i ...
i did n't say i did n't love you . i said stay away from me .
edie , i need you to love me . tell me you love me .
get away from me .
edie ...
it 's just a scratch . you wo n't die . she turns away from him .
my hand .
i keep hearing it and i do n't know what to do..i do n't know what to do ... .
i never mentioned the word before . in his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table .
that word again ! why do you keep saying conscience , conscience ... .
i do n't want you to do anything . let your conscience tell you what to do .
i know what you want me to do !
it 's you who 's being hurt . by keeping it inside you , like a poison . sooner or later it 's got to come out .
i do n't want to hurt charley i do n't want to hurt you ...
how can you be with charley and johnny friendly and still be with me ? either way it 's a lie . it 's like there were two different people inside of you . you 've got to be one or the other .
edie , listen to me ! i want you to believe me . i want to be with you .
i do n't want to talk about it . i want you to go .
you think i stink , do n't you ? you think i stink for what i told you ?
lucky pop is n't home , he 'd kill you .
i had to , edie . i had to see you .
edie it 's
do n't tell me do n't tell me !
what i did to joey .
you ... .
what i did to joey .
told him what ?
i just told the father .
terry what 's happening to you ?
the father . the father .
who says ?
yeah , yeah , it 's up to me , it 's up to me he says it 's up to me .
you ?
i 've been sittin ' in the church .
terry , what 's wrong ?
edie ... edie ... ..
i know ... i know ... .
edie i i never said this to a girl before , i never knew a girl worth trying to say it for , but you you 're ... .
there 's a hawk around . they 're scared tonight .
pigeons ... .
go ahead , wear it .
i do n't rate it .
i i brought this for you , terry . it was joey 's . yours is coming out at the elbows .
edie !
much more , terry . much , much more !
i 'm tryin ' to keep you from being hurt what more do you want ?
it 's true .
do n't say that , edie , do n't ...
look out for number one . always number one . i should 've known you would n't tell me . pop said johnny friendly used to own you . i think he still owns you . no wonder everybody calls you a bum .
edie , your old man 's right , go back to that school out in daisyland . you 're driving yourself nuts you 're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself .
it was johnny friendly who killed joey , was n't it ?
i wo n't eat cheese for no cops , that 's for sure .
what are you going to do ?
that goes double for me .
i ca n't let myself fall in love with you .
because ... because ... listen edie , do n't get sore now but i think we 're getting in love with each other .
why should i come hollering to you at all ?
okay , get in hot water . but do n't come hollerin ' to me when you get burned .
why worry about me ? you 're the one who says only look out for yourself .
edie , listen , stay out of this mess . quit tryin ' to ask things about joey . it ai n't safe for you .
it 's fun dancing with your eyes closed . i 'm floating . i 'm floating ... .
i i never knew a girl like you , edie . i always knew the kind you just grab 'em and i never knew a girl like you , edie .
i thought i felt mean tonight . but i 'm not i 'm just all mixed up ... .
what are you crying for ?
for not being any help ?
what for ?
you 're not sore at me ?
i got my whole life to drink .
i do n't want it . but why do n't you stay and finish your drink .
you have n't finished your beer .
all right , all right.. i should n't 've asked you .
i i 'd like to , edie , but there 's nothin ' i can do . edie feels subdued , ashamed at breaking down . she rises , and in a low voice says
why keep harpin ' on it ? come on , drink up . you got to get a little fun out of life . what 's the matter with you ? i 'll play you some music .
like joey ? are you afraid to mention his name ?
but that 's living like an animal
if you do n't keep your neck in and your nose clean and you 'll never have no trouble down here .
and if you do n't ?
edie , down here it 's every man for himself . it 's keepin ' alive ! it 's standin ' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin ' in your pocket .
you do n't believe in anything , do you ?
but a priest ... ?
you 've been off in daisyland , honey . everybody 's got a racket .
his racket ?
yeah , yeah ... . this father barry , what 's his racket ?
he was looking at everybody the same way . asking the same question .
well , nobody , i guess . but that father barry , i did n't like the way he kept lookin ' at me .
why , terry , who said it was ?
listen get this straight do n't look at me when you say them things . it was n't my fault what happened to your brother . fixing joey was n't my idea ... .
and when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of them is that your idea ?
what do they do for you , except get in your way ?
i never met such a person . not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body .
i 'm not lookin ' to get crucified . i 'm lookin ' to stay in one piece .
our lord said just the opposite .
want to hear my philosophy ? do it to him before he does it to you .
terry !
gee , thoughts ! alla time thoughts ! you really believe that drool ?
is n't everybody part of everybody else ?
what a fruitcake you are !
should n't we care about everybody ?
i had to scrap all my life . figured i might as well get paid for it . when i was a kid my old man got killednever mind how . charley and i was put in a placethey called it a children 's home . some home ! i run away and peddled papers , fought in club smokers and but what am i runnin ' off at the mouth for ? what do you care ?
what made you want to be a fighter ?
describing you . a square from out there . i mean you 're nowhere . miss four corners .
now what are you doing ?
naw , in the ring , a dive is-
a dive ? you mean , into the water ?
i went pretty good for a while , did n't i , al ? but i did n't stay in shape and i had to take a few dives .
were you really a prize fighter ?
hit me again , mac .
no thanks ... .
how about another one ?
it 's quite nice .
how do you like it ?
wham ... .
i am ?
likewise . and draw two for chasers . now you 're beginning to live .
come on , i know a quiet one , with a special entrance for ladies ... .
in a saloon ?
want to go out and have one with me ?
i do n't know .
listen , you like beer ?
one thing about them though , they 're faithful . they get married just like people .
even pigeons are n't peaceful .
if another fella tries to take that perch away from him , he lets him have it .
oh she 's a beauty .
how do you like that one ?
the things that go on .
i go for this stuff . you know this city 's full of hawks ? there must be twenty thousand of 'em . they perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park .
i would n't have thought you 'd be so interested in pigeons .
i like pigeons . you send a bird five hundred miles away he wo n't stop for food or water until he 's back in his own coop .
that was nice of you .
he had a few birds . i got up and fed 'em this morning .
you do n't mind yourself at all , do you . joey used to race pigeons .
here they come ! the champion flock of the neighborhood .
i started them golden warriors . i was their first supreme commander .
the golden warriors .
good . so do i .
i changed my mind . i feel real mean tonight .
i really do n't know .
i do n't know .
what for ?
listen , edie , am i going to see you again ?
thanks anyway .
i only live up there and across the roof .
i 'd better go in .
that 's my own flock up there , getting their evening workout . i won plenty of races with 'em . listen , you want to see them ? come up on the roof with me and i 'll show 'em to you .
do you like pigeons ?
boy , they sure fly nice , do n't they ?
well he played it smart . too many good-for-nothin 's around here . all they got on their mind 's a little beer , a little pool , a little i better get you home .
when mother died pop sent me out to school in the country . he was afraid with no one home i 'd get into bad company .
what-what ? where you been the last four five years ? outer space ?
what ?
pardon me while i reach for my beads .
what 's that ?
with a little more patience and kindness . that 's what makes people mean and difficult . nobody cares enough about them .
how would you 've done it ?
maybe they just did n't know how to handle you .
now you got me ! it 's a wonder i was n't punchy by the time i was twelve . the rulers those sisters used to whack me with ! they thought they could beat an education into mei foxed 'em .
i remember you were in trouble all the time .
some people got faces that stick in your mind .
the moment i saw you .
the thought i 'm tryin ' to get over is you grew up beauteeful . remember me ?
i can get home all right from here
man , you were a mess !
i know . i thought i 'd never get those braces off .
looked like two pieces of rope . and your teeth were
in braids ? that 's right .
yeah . yeah . i get your thought . you know i seen you lots of times before . parochial school on pulaski street ? seven , eight years ago ? your hair come down in
it is n't brains . it 's how you use them .
a teacher ! dong ! ! ! you know i admire brains . take my brother charley . he 's very brainy . very .
i want to be a teacher .
and you spend all your time just learning stuff , huh ?
it 's a regular college . it 's just run by the nuns . the sisters of st. anne .
you training to be a nun or something ?
you know how the sisters are .
i better get home .
aah , he 's a bottlebaby , he talks to himself , the joke of the neighborhood .
what did that man mean when he said you were ... . ?
everybody knew him . he got around .
everybody loved joey . from the little kids to the old rummies . did you know him very well ?
i better see you get there .
i 'll get home all right now .
i 'm with terry .
which side are you with ?
they play pretty rough .
thanks . steel pipes and baseball bats .
i think we 're o.k .
things 're lookin ' up on the docks , huh , jackie ?
none of your business .
what makes him so special ?
give it to me my pop 's job
oh , i thought you was gon na go to work with all them muscles .
let me by .
where you goin ' ?
pop !
you are like
pop , do n't think i 'm not feeling grateful for all you 've done to get me an education and shelter me from this . but now my eyes are open . i see things i know are so wrong how can i go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people are n't living ? i 'm staying , pop . and i 'm going to keep on trying to find out who 's guilty for joey . i 'd walk home with a dozen terry malloys if i thought they could help me . i tell you i 'm staying , pop . pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers .
see this arm ? it 's two inches longer 'n the other one . that 's years of workin ' and sweatin ' , liftin ' and swingin ' a hook . and every time i heisted a box or a coffee bag i says to myselfthis is for edie , so she can be a teacher or somethin ' decent . i promised your mother . you better not let her down .
and learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice ? pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms , his right one closer to edie ; he trembles with emotion .
you think we kept you out in tarrytown just to have you go walkin ' with a corner saloon hoodlum like terry malloy ? now get back to tarrytown , before i put a strap to you .
he wanted to see me again .
six-toed cats . assyrians . abyssinians . it 's the same difference . well do n't think this terry malloy is any six-toed cockeyed assyrian . he 's a bum . charley and johnny friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action .
he was n't abyssinian , pop , assyrian ... .
a look in his eyes ! hold your hats , brother , here we go again . you think he 's one of those cases you 're always draggin ' in and feelin ' sorry for . like the litter of kittens you hadthe only one she wants to keep has six toes and it 's cockeyed to boot . look at him . the bum ! and the crush you had on that little abyssinian ... .
he tries to act tough , but there 's a look in his eyes that ... .
i 'm not trying to tell you he 's little lord fauntleroy .
are you trying to tell me terry is too ?
who is he ! edie , you 're so softhearted and soft-headed you would n't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat . you know who this terry malloy is ? the kid brother of charlie the gent , johnny friendly 's right hand , a butcher in a camel hair coat .
who is he , pop ?
edie , for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar , to keep you up there with the sisters , and to keep you from things like i just seen out the window . my own daughter arm-in-arm with terry malloy . you know who terry malloy is ?
pop , i 'm not ready to go back yet .
you 're all packed . and here 's your bus ticket . you 're on your way back to st. anne 's .
i can ? okay . okay ...
you can !
johnny friendly is layin ' odds that you wo n't get up .
... walk ?
a bum . look what you 're doing . you want to be brave ? firing lead into another man 's flesh is n't brave . any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave . you want to hurt johnny friendly ? you want to fix him for what he did to charley and a dozen men who were better than charley ? do n't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle . that 's just what he wants . he 'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense . fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it truth is the gun drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little cap pistol .
take your hands off me . what you call me ?
you go to
what did you say ?
you go to hell .
give me that gun .
why do n't you go and chase yourself ?
this is my business .
mind your own business , father .
your gun .
what do you want from me , father .
now do n't give me a hard time .
you got eyes . i 'm right in front of you .
i want to see you , terry .
is that all you 've got to say to me , father ?
good luck .
conscience ... . i did n't even know i had one until i met you and edie ... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts .
ball games ! do n't break my heart ! i would n't care if he gave you a life pass to the polo grounds . so you got a brother . well , let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they 're all getting the short end while your cousin johnny gets mustard on his face at the polo grounds . if i was you listen , i 'm not asking you to do anything , terry . it 's your own conscience that 's got to do the asking .
but it 's my own brother they 're askin ' me to finger and johnny friendly . his mother and my mother was first cousins . when i was this high he took me to the ball games ... .
how much is your soul worth if you do n't ?
if i spill , my life wo n't be worth a nickel .
a question of who rides who .
it 's like carrying a monkey around on your back .
edie . the commission . your subpoena . i know you got a subpoena .
about edie ?
what are you going to do ?
it started as a favor for my brother you know they 'd ask me things and it 's hard to say no a favor who am i kiddin ' ? they call it a favor but it 's do it or else . and this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off joey . i just thought they 'd lean on him a little but last night with edie i wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat . i guess i was scared of drivin ' her away and i love her , father . she 's the first thing i ever loved .
i 'll find you a priest .
but you 've got to listen to me .
tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed . but if i dig it out myself i can use it where it 'll do the most good .
i do n't get it !
i do n't want to hear it in there .
but you 're the one i want to tell what you said over nolan about keepin ' silent when you know the score i 'm guilty you hear me ? i 'm guilty ... .
someone else c'n take your confession .
what 's the matter ? i 've got something that 's chokin ' me . i 've got ta get it out .
well , i had my fun , i 've drunk my fill and i tickled some good-lookin ' fillies i 'm on borried time .
so help me god !
down to the wire ?
and i still say you stand up and i 'll stand up with you .
baseball bats that 's just for openers . they 'll put the muscle on you , turned-around collar or no turned-around collar .
i 'll go down the line , kayo , believe me .
if i stick my neck out , and they chopped it off , would that be the end of it ? or are you ready to go all the way ?
what do you think ?
are you on the level , father ?
you still call it ratting ?
but you still hold out for silence ?
those blood suckers . how i 'd love to fix those babies but
nice fellows .
yeah , considerin ' they was usin ' my head for a baseball !
you all right , nolan ?
deef 'n dumb . somethin ' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we do n't see nothin ' . you know what i mean . no matter how much we hate the torpedoes we do n't rat .
d 'n d ?
father , one thing you got to understand . on the dock we 've always been d 'n d .
now listen , if you know who the pistols are , if you see them on the dock every day , are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one ? are you ? are you ? how about you , nolan ?
have a seat . i 'm trying to find out just what happened to joey doyle . maybe you can help .
who asked him here ?
sure ... .
where you going ? i 'll walk along with you .
yeah , really !
really ?
looping right ! i never swung wild . i was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under whop-whop !
well , i better get going . hit those stairs again . was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him ?
yeah ?
yeah . my own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet i had it in me to hit the top and boy , if i wanted to , the things i could tell you about them guys
i 'll never forget it . i thought it was all over .
remember the first round how i had him against the ropes , and
i 'm just resting my feet .
listen , this ai n't for publication .
such as what ?
yeah . johnny friendly and my brother had other ideas .
you sure looked it . something go wrong ?
if i licked him i would have had the title shot instead of him boy , i was ready that night .
i think you could have .
you want to know something i would have taken wilson
i thought you were going to take him that night but ...
wilson yeah yeah i fought wilson .
did n't i see you fight in the garden one night three or four years ago ? with a fellow called wilson ?
well , it 'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it . do n't you think ?
i guess it 's pretty tough work at that .
not exactly . just thought i 'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute . you know the next investigation we get into i hope it 's got buildings with elevators in them . this one has been nothing but climbing stairs . and when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out .
you looking for me ?
you know what you 're askin ' ? you 're askin '
you can bring a lawyer if you wish . and you 're privileged under the constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes .
i told you i do n't know nothin ' and i ai n't saying nothin ' .

i got it . hot off the press .
how 'd you get that .
he do n't , huh ? well , he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation .
you mean kayo nolan , the old timer ? he does n't know much .
oh , he did . half an hour later a certain timothy j. nolan went into secret session with the commission and he did all the talking .
it was a big nothing ! the father did all the talking .
nothing happened , he says . some operator you got yourself there , charley . one more like him and we 'll all be wearing striped pajamas .
nothing happened , johnny .
i thought you were gon na keep an eye on that church meeting .

i know , johnny , i know ... .
ok skip it , einstein . how come you never got no education like the rest of us ?
thirty-six sev aah i lost the count .

i can look at her , ca n't i ? it 's a free country .
she 's off limits for bums like you . leave her alone .
i was only talkin ' to her .
you know what i mean . leave her alone .
what do you mean ?
you got some nerve .
look who says bum !
i ca n't believe it a small fortune . you ca n't buy me you 're still a bum ! 'bye , edie . lord have mercy on joey .
yeah , yeah here 's half a buck , go have yourself a ball .
one little dime you do n't need . i know you you 're edie doyle . your brother 's a saint only one ever tried to get me my compensation .
coffee , that 's a laugh . his belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey .
a dime . one thin dime for a cup of coffee .
thanks for nothing , you bum .
do n't give me that coffee , you rummy . now blow !
a dime , terry , a dime for a cup of coffee ?
go on , beat it !
tippi-tippi-tim , tippi-tim , tippi-tippi-tan , tippi-tan ... got ta dime for a crippled-up docker ?
i wonder how many hail marys the father 'll make me say at confession . it 'll be worth it ! the pallet is loaded now . terry turns and approaches nolan .
definitely ! nolan , my boy , you 're a walkin ' distillery .
i was afraid one bottle might get lonely by itself . now you see the advantage of a little man in a big coat .
patrick , me lad , i 'm ahead of you .
you think one bottle 's enough for all them toasts ?
when we knock off let 's have a bit of a party . we 'll drink to god and ireland , its whiskey and its women , to joey and edie and death to tyrants everywhere ... . !
you see , kayo , the good lord watches over us after all .
nolan , me lad , ye 're dreamin ' again .
a banana boat . it would be bananas . one of these days me ship 's comin ' in from ireland , god love 'er , loaded to the gunnels with sweet irish whiskey !
nolan ... .
what are you down here for to see we do n't make off with any of mister friendly 's precious cargo ?
listen nolan
one of these days .
maybe i will one of these days .
go ask him , why do n't you ? ask him yourself .
you do n't think he 'd be helpful ?
keep charley out of this .
the brother of charley the gent . they 'll help us get to the bottom of the river .
i do not joke in my proposal .
leave her alone , i tell you !
..oh , you could do nothing ! i can save you much pain .
if i could get my hands on you ...
fiend is it ! you will not be so fortunate . your existence will cease within moments . no one wishes to see a man dance ... and you , my dear , will entertain for centuries to come .
leave her alone , you fiend !
of course i do .
you love me then ?
there 's nothing to forgive . it was all a dream .
i love you bob . i really do . forgive me ?
maybe so .
< i > him ! < /i > i 'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on .
my old boyfriend tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this . at least < i > he 's < /i > got brains .
all right . put it on heavy .
i still do n't know what ever made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you .
i do n't know , yet . we 'll just have to watch our chance . when it comes i 'll know what to do -- i hope i 'll know what to do .
what can we do against them ?
i 've got the ropes loose now . i 've got my hands free . be careful -- do n't change your expression too much . they must not catch on .
... and i thought you loved me .
yes , that sudden . if it were n't for you we would n't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this . it 's all your fault .
that sudden ?
i should hope not . i hate you !
they would n't dare put us in the same grave -- < b > or would they ? < /b >
oh , no i 'm not . these heathens probably have an open grave for us .
you 're talking nonsense .
yes i feel it in my bones .
you do ?
be careful , oh please be careful . we 'll never get out of here alive , i know it . i just feel it .
hold on just a little longer , shirley .
i 'm frightened . i 'm so frightened .
my guess is if we do n't take the chance pretty soon , we 're not going to have much life left anyway .
nothing is worth your life .
i am -- it 's our only chance .
be careful !
the ropes are coming loose .
whatever you do , do n't do that .
i 'm afraid i 'll faint .
easy shirley , easy ! panic wo n't do us any good ! let me think . we 've got to stall for time .
i do n't know . i just do n't know . but do n't give up . we 're not finished yet .
what can we do ?
do n't let them hear you .
those creatures.. !
you 've got a right to be . we 're trapped by a bunch of fiends .
i 'm so frightened .
be careful ! -- they 'll see you .
look !
i 'm not sure , myself . it 's just a feeling i 've had since the crash ... like i feel a cold chill all over.. ..now this !
what do you mean ?
i 'm not sure ...
ca n't we get out of here ?
it 's an initiation all right , but not of a college as you and i know them . nothing alive looks like that !
could it be some kind of college initiation ?
well , it 's probably just the caretaker , and that 's exactly who we want to find . they 'll have a telephone . c'mon .
i ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music .
not dead ? in a cemetery ?
what help will that do if something in there is n't dead ?
all right . do n't worry , i 'll be right beside you .
i 'm not sure i care to find out what it is .
something 's making that music .
what help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night ?
that 's what i want to find out . we have to get help .
then..then what 's that music ?
silly , there 's nothing in there to be afraid of .
it frightens me .
in there .
where ?
well we certainly ca n't stay here . c'mon .
okay .
i 'm getting the jitters ! let 's turn back !
there 's an old cemetery on this road . i 've been there before .
well , fact or not , i do n't see how we 're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight . i ca n't see a thing ! let 's turn back .
all of my books are based on fact , or legend . thats perhaps why they 're more interesting and sell in the top spots .
who 's to say my monsters are n't alive ?
that 's life . my kisses are alive .
your puritan upbringing holds you back from my monsters , but it certainly does n't hurt your art of kissing .
shirley , i wrote for years without selling a single word .
but horror stories ! why all the time horror stories ?
sure there are -- and i 've tried them all . plays , love stories , westerns , dog stories . huh , now there was a good one , that dog story all about --
but there 're so many wonderful things to write about , bob .
you would n't understand . seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story .
but does it have to be in a cemetery ?
no . it 's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind .
we sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery . let 's turn back .
now hurry , hurry . i will watch ! your desires may be my pleasure also ... our fitting climax to an evening 's enter- tainment . you must ... hurry now .
thank you , master ! thank you .
you better hope there is .
is there time ?
you may take her now .
you mean ... !
your pleasures of course !
for what ! ? !
the time ... is short .
all others were but infinitessimal bits of fluff , compared to < i > her < /i > this one would have < i > died < /i > for feathers , furs , and fluff ... and so she did !
hahh , there is always time ... all in good time ... there is < b > always < /b > time . you shall have your pleasure . < b > that < /b > ... i < i > decree < /i >
oh , if there is only time !
there is yet time . do n't you want your own pleasure ?
the < b > moon < /b > is almost < b > gone ! < /b >
then cancel my order .
you had the mummy cancel all the others scheduled for this session .
i will decide the conclusion .
the moon sinks lower into the hills ! we must hurry to the finish .
well then let us proceed .
there are others .
then see that it does not happen again , in the penalty of everlasting despair . now are there others ?
i understand , master
your own pleasure comes only after mine , when i desire it . i am the sole ruler of the dark world . there is no one to challenge my authority here . my word is the law -- all powerful . < b > no one < /b > is to challenge that authority , < b > no one ! < /b > . is that understood ? it is my command .
i would have time for my own pleasures !
i know the laws of the night . i state there is still time for yet another .
at the first sight of the morning 's rays ' light ...
ahh , there is yet time .
the moon is almost gone !
at your discretion ... but first , i desire more entertainment .
when ! ?
ahh , she will be yours .
well ?
the princess of darkness would have you for her own to join us through extreme pain . yet i am inclined for one as lovely as you , to be more lenient . i have but to touch you with my finger , and it would mean the end of you , all over , quickly and painlessly ...
she is to be < b > mine ! < /b > it is so spoken !
ahh , but i declare there is still time for < i > some < /i > thing .
it would seem so , master
i suppose most of the others will have to wait for their judgement until after the next full moon .
at the first sight of the morning sun 's rays , we must be gone .
yes , yes yes i know all that .
as you wish , master
now , i will talk ... to the wolf man ... and the mummy .
she pleases me . permit her to live in the world of the snakes .
it would seem so , master .
oh , yes , a religion of sorts .
as i said , a worshipper of snakes , and of smoke , and flames .
she was ?
her dance has pleased me .
el dia de los muertos ... a celebration in her country .
she came to us on the day of the dead .
she loved the bull ring and the matador . she danced to their destruction . now she dances to her own destruction . her dance is of skulls .
what kind of symbol ?
a symbol , master .
... and what is this ?
tie them that they may watch .
a situation easily remedied .
but they are not yet one of us .
yes , sir , master .
ahh , good . then i will see them . dismiss the rest .
there are one or two which should complement the night 's entertainment , master
you are the keepers of the damned . you two know them all . and i am tired of this usual type of entertainment . i want ... a decided change .
then it is some service you desire of us .
aaaahhhh .

it 's not often an emperor like < i > you < /i > calls on creatures like us .

we do n't know of anything , master ...
you know better than that .

yes , master , and we caught them , him and me .
live ones where only the dead should be ?
yes , master .

aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh ?
what do you suppose for ?
aaahhnnnahnnnn .

aaarrrgggaahh .
when i was alive , they were the things nightmares were made of .
aahhhhnnnaaahahnn . aaaaaahhhhooowwwoooooooooooooooooooooo !
we had lots of snakes in my ancient egypt ... slimy , slinky things .
aaaahhhhnnnahhhnnnggnnn .

aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh ?
i do n't like snakes . i remember the one cleopatra used . cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue , and those two sharp fangs . you 'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop .
he did , huh . well , tell buddy i see glenn wearing his sunglasses i 'll step on 'em . i might not even take 'em off first .
yeah , that 's him . buddy says glenn thinks you guys are real cool .
glenn michaels .
well , seeing as you have so much luck with cars , buddy thought it might be better to bring two . he got this guy he says you know from lompoc , glenn something .
what 're you talking about ?
and the one driving the other car ?
listen , adele , the reason i called , that party is today instead of sunday . about eight-thirty , like only a few hours from now . so you 'll have to get hold of buddy , whatever he might be doing ...
emil the amazing . the bastard fired me and hired another girl , a redhead . i 'm working on a new business card , pass out to the cafes . how 's this sound --
what happened to mandrake the magician ?
what 's free about it ? i 'm looking for work .
listen to miss smarty mouth . out there in the free world .
so why do n't you come right out and tell me what you 're talking about ?
i said not as a rule .
did n't you tell me one-time calls are n't monitored ?
you know that super bowl party ? they changed the date . it 's on < u > tonight < /u > , eight-thirty .
till it 's not funny any more . what do you want , jack ?
that 's funny , adele . how many more times you gon na gim me that one ?
tell me , how do you do that ?
yes .
you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside ?
yes .
what ? !
lie face down on the floor .
who is it ?
i want to speak with you , please .
uh -- sorry . wrong number .
yes , it is .
oh , is this adele ?
thank you .
you 're good .
who are you ?
ask him his name .
any idea where i could find buddy ? or glenn ?
that was n't jack 's fault . no , that was on account of buddy , for some reason , decided to call his sister and confess to a job < u > before < /u > they 'd done it instead of after . she called the fbi and they both went down , ended up at lompoc . i think buddy felt kinda bad about that .
till they got busted .
jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena , could n't get his stolen car to start . battery was dead . he looks over , sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville , goes up , offers him a thousand dollars for a jump . turns out , buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing . buddy says , i 'll take the thousand , but we 're leaving in my car , not that piece of shit you come in . they musta robbed fifty banks together .
buddy 'll take care of him . keep him out 've trouble . he 's jack 's conscience . always has been . he tell you how they met ?
adele , sooner or later , he 's gon na get caught . i 'd like to get him before he does something else , makes it worse on himself .
really . hm .
i 'll say one thing for jack , he was never ugly or mean , or drank too much . he was very considerate , lights on or off , if you know what i mean .
he said he was a card player . i could live with that . i never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening , comes out of the bank and the car 's on fire . i did go see him in jail to tell him i was filing for divorce . he said , `` okay . '' jack 's so easy going . he was fun , but never what you 'd call a real husband .
did you know that when you married him ?
huh . problem is , jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks . it 's all he 's ever done .
he said he wished the two of you could start over , live a normal life .
he did ? i do n't remember . did he say about me ? in the trunk ?
he called the day he escaped .
he 'd call every once in a while .
but you spoke to him on the phone .
i do n't know . he was different after he was sentenced , looking at thirty years . said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer .
why not ?
he did n't want me to .
you did n't visit him in prison .
he gets that way when he 's nervous sometimes .
you mean , did he try to jump me ? no , but he was kind of talkative .
he did n't hurt you or anything , did he ?
no , thanks .
i 'm getting ready to go out . you can come in if you want , sit down for a minute . would you like a diet coke ?
i know a glenn .
but you know what i 'm talking about , do n't you ? about glenn , do n't you , and the second car ?
they did n't < i > tell < /i > me anything , they asked questions .
the fbi did n't tell you i was with them ?
from glades to the turnpike . then i left with glenn .
you were < i > both < /i > in the trunk ? together ?
why you want to do that , to a frien ' ?
go away , or i 'll call the police .
listen , i 'm the one help jack escape from prison . he tole me , i ca n't find him to see you . so why do n't you open this fucking door . okay ? so we can speak .
i do n't know where he is .
tell me where is jack foley , i do n't bother you no more .
wait in the hall ! i have to get dressed !
listen to me . i 'm a good friend of jack foley .
i 'm not dressed .
yes , around here . i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here . manuel the mayishan was my name .
you say you perform in the miami area ?
his assistant .
you were his what , his box ?
yeah , i was emil 's box-jumper for almost four years .
you did work for emil , right ?
oh . uh-huh .
i talk to the guy you work for , emil . he tole me your number and where you live . see , i 'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you .
yes .
adele ? you in there ?
listen , buddy , the shit that 's about to go down , you 'll be on the phone with your sister for a month . let me do this part alone .
jack --
no , you dump the van , meet me at the airport . i 'll take one of ripley 's cars .
i 'll go with you .
i 'm going back inside .
all you got ta do is get in .
we made it , did n't we ?
at least .
and then they 'll kill 'em .
from the looks of those boys , the ripper too .
they 're gon na rape the maid , are n't they .
what ?
shit .
come < i > on < /i > .
they sure do .
they look like plain old rocks .
yeah , hi . nice house .
you remember buddy , do n't you , richard ?
they found the safe .
stay with the maid . i 'm gon na have a look around .
i do n't ski .
you ever wear one of these ?
i 'm not leaving you alone with these assholes .
there 's still time , take me up on my offer .
and who watches your back ?
getting me out of glades for starters .
half for doing what ?
i 'll make you a deal . get out of here . right now . i 'll do the job with the snoop , meet you wherever you want and give you half .
but you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do ?
i get that feeling , yeah .
you know they gon na set us up .
whatta you wan na do ?
they want to go tonight , before glenn gets in any trouble , opens his big mouth .
i do n't know .
so what 's that mean ? that you 're disappointed by what you found or you 're sorry you robbed all those banks ?
yeah , i did .
you find out ?
it was n't about getting laid . i just wanted to know what might 've happened if things were different .
did you give her a jump ? if you did i might begin to understand where your head 's at .
you know how i felt about her .
so how 's that work , a wanted felon socializing with a u.s. marshal ?
yes , she did .
and she saw you ?
i saw karen sisco .
it took you , what , seven hours to buy a pair of shoes ?
yeah , and i better call my sister .
listen , i got ta get some better shoes , few other things before tomorrow . why do n't you drop me off at the ren cen , we 'll hook up later ?
they put a gun on you , you still have a choice , do n't you ?
they put a gun on you , you 'll go back .
you might not have a choice .
yeah , it 's called glades correctional institution and i 'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it .
my sister believes in fate , but not hell . that 's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you do n't hear that much about purgatory anymore . but every day she asks her boss to pray i do n't fuck up . whatta you think , you think there 's a hell , jack ?
let fate decide ? what 're you , the fuckin ' dali lama now ?
i mean , they do n't know for sure he 's dead . look , there 's always a chance we 'll walk out 've there with nothing . i say let fate decide .
what about that d.b . cooper guy ?
tell me something , buddy . you know anyone who 's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life ? cause it occurred to me that everyone < u > talks < /u > about doing it , but i do n't know anyone who 's actually gone and < u > done < /u > it . do you ?
let glenn deal with the snoop , while we 're off livin ' the good life .
who says anybody 's gon na be with us ? i say we go to the fights tomorrow , find out what the snoop 's big plan is , then go in ahead of those guys -- < u > alone < /u > .
yeah ? you think he 'll let us in , we got snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us ?
time comes , we knock on the door . see if he wants to talk about old times . go in the easy way .
no doubt the man 's got some big-ass security system .
jesus , look at that wall . place almost looks like a prison .
now that 's a really big house .
let 's drive by where we 're meeting and have a look . maybe take a look at ripley 's place while we 're at it .
forget about my sister . if karen sisco 's tailing glenn , we 're fucked . tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up .
you did n't tell your sister about ripley , did you ? 'cause i do n't wan na go through that again .
forty-five minutes .
how long were you with the girl ?
two hours .
how long you talk to her ?
just hung up .
you tell your sister about it ?
they do n't stay the night , jack , 'less you pay for it .
i think she 's after glenn . the girl still with you ?
she came up here on her vacation , 'cause she likes shitty weather .
does n't say what she 's doing up here , but i do n't think it has anything to do with us .
outside of that .
what 's he do now , tell fortunes ?
is that snoopy ? in the purple doo rag ?
or two .
i think glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner .
whatta you think ?
love is funny .
`` fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying . '' seems this woman 's live-in boyfriend , seventy years old , complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge . police found noodles in the woman 's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him . they 'd been together ten years .
she just sat there , looking right at me .
they know where i live , i guess they know what i drive , so maybe we should pick up another car on the way .
he is n't fighting no more . glenn told me the snoop 's been managing some guys up there now , works out at the kronk .
snoopy . christ , i thought he 'd be brain dead by now .
remember snoopy miller , his old pal from lompoc ?
well , first off , if you were glenn , you would n't be thinking .
i been thinkin ' , if i was glenn , i was up there to take down the ripper , where would i go ?
first thing we do , we get to detroit , we find glenn , then we find a window to throw him out of .
now you 're talkin ' .
let 's go to detroit .
sure looks that way .
i guess adele 's in good hands .
uh-huh ...
there . you see the guy sitting on the porch ? the old ladies and one guy ? you know they 'll have a couple more in a car somewhere .
in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel . that 's her place .
you at least bring the gun ?
i 'm a tourist .
nice disguise .
shit .
and you know they 're gon na have some people watching the hotel .
her phone 's probably tapped .
so call her up . tell her do n't talk to any cubans .
we were talking one time , drinking rum . i may 've mentioned adele , how she worked for a magician . chino got interested . he 's like , yeah ? how does he saw the woman in half ? he wanted to meet her . or get a look at her if she ever came to visit .
jack ?
he knows where she lives ?
he 's got ta know by now that i gave him up back at glades . he does , he 's gon na try to find me . maybe go see adele , see what she knows .
he 's running for his life , he does n't give a shit about you .
chino 's gon na wan na talk to me .
you better come see this .
what ? !
we 'll leave first thing in the morning .
longer we hang around down here , jack , better chance there is either glenn 's gon na fuck up the whole score , or we gon na get busted , or both .
am i going to detroit by myself ?
think this old guy is her boyfriend ? it 's the only picture she carries .
you 'll have to ask glenn . and most likely , he 's on his way to detroit , where we should be .
yeah , but what happened after she drove off with glenn ?
just that she got away .
say anything in there about karen sisco ?
paper says there 's ten grand each on you , chino and lulu .
maybe this 'll make you feel better .
i was n't feeling my best that day . i 'd just drawn thirty to life .
they pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want , nobody 'll know you .
sounds great .
there 's a store around the corner , i 'll be right back .
i know exactly what you mean . it 's just a feeling . you know , i could go for some wine tonight .
there 's something about a nice hot bath , transforms a person . it 's not just about opening up your pores , know what i mean ? there 's just something about the heat and the wet that 's calming you know ? settles me in a way that i really ca n't articulate .
oh , man .
there 's some lilac oil , you want some , a vanilla candle under the sink .
i 've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months . soak the prison off me .
you 're right .
you 're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you .
cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time , waiting to make her move .
i 'm just saying she was n't scared .
you 're too late , jack .
i want to talk to her again , that 's all . see what would happen under , you know , normal circumstances .
you want to take her to my place and get cleaned up ? you come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes , `` oh , i had you all wrong '' ?
he ai n't the problem , jack .
i do n't know why , but every time he opens his mouth i want to punch him out .
his idea ? gim me a break . fuckin ' guy 's got a vacant lot for a head . was you and me figured the whole thing out .
how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with ?
why you brought glenn into this , i 'll never know .
i brought 'em , they 're back at glades in the cadillac . you wanted to take her car .
wait a minute . let me have your raincoat . somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes .
the green-and-whites saw us . one of 'em starts thinking , what 's that car doing there ? ties it to the break and turns around ...
do we need him ?
get the shotgun . and her purse . i 'd like to know who she is .
jesus christ , what were you doing in there ?
she 's coming with us .
we may as well leave her , we 're leaving the car and we got ta leave her some place anyway , what 's the difference where ?
okay , honey , come on out of there .
that 's the turnpike up there . glenn 's waiting with the other car .
where in the hell are we ?
why do n't we talk about it later ?
i bet that 's all the hacks they send out . otherwise nobody 's left to mind the store .
the wall street guy ? oh , yeah . i did n't recognize him without his rug .
it 's richard ripley .
and you let them come up . you do n't try to make the bust yourself . you understand ?
call and tell you .
now you see foley and this guy bragg come in behind us , whatta you do ?
you can go wait out in the car , you want to .
what ? daniel , i wan na go upstairs .
take the radio , stay down here in the lobby , watch the elevator .
the manager 's door is metal .
yeah , why ?
you 're gon na use a ram ?
you 're primary , you 're secondary , you 're point man .
they 're in 7d .
you get the key ?
good . now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the adams hotel .
that 's all i wanted to know .
yeah , sure , karen . you bring in chirino , you can be on the task force .
yes or no , daniel . if i get him , will you let me go after foley ?
what ? is that what you 're calling me about ?
oh , i was just wondering , if i were to bring in chirino , would you put me on the task force ?
now . what is it you wanted to tell me ?
sure , daniel .
but do n't you < u > do < /u > anything . you just have a seat , wait for me to get there .
all right , but ...
there was a buddy bragg at lompoc around the same time foley was there . we got an address for him at the adams hotel in hallandale . i want you to go there , see if you can get the manager to i.d . him as the other guy . if he does , you call me right away ...
yeah , i know . i was just leaving . why were you trying to reach me ?
what -- we already talked to her . that 's a dead end .
i 'm at adele delisi 's .
where are you ? i been trying to reach you .
daniel . listen --
karen . where are you ? i been trying to get a hold of you .
shut up .
sounds to me like he liked having you around . i 'll see you , karen . mr. sisco .
you 'll have to ask him .
we 'll talk another time , karen . all right ? i 'd like to know why foley put you in that second car when he did n't need you any more .
you have to know what you 're talking about .
i have to qualify , is that it ?
have you ever shot a man ? how many times have you been primary through the door ?
karen , i 've been with the bureau fifteen years , on all kinds of investigations .
daniel , what do you work on most of the time , fraud ? go after crooked bookkeepers .
you say in the report glenn did n't have a gun , but you let him get away , too .
is that what you would 've done ?
the time came , you shot him . but you did n't shoot foley or the guy with him . they 're unarmed , you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk . okay , now you got your sig in your hand . you say in the report you could n't turn around , he had you pinned down . but when the trunk opened , how come you did n't cap the two guys then ?
and what happened to carl ?
yeah , but i had enough reason to believe he did , and i told you . so you had to at least suspect him .
when i was seeing carl tillman , i did n't know he robbed banks .
foley made me think of that fella carl tillman , the one you were seeing , it turns out the same time he was doing banks . you recall that ?
it was an unusual experience .
this fella holds you hostage , you talk about movies ?
oh ... different things , prison , movies .
what 'd you talk about ?
in the trunk , yeah ?
you talked to him ?
really ? huh . he told me he did n't remember how many he robbed .
there 's a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you . buddy is it ? and this fella jack foley . i swear the man must 've robbed two hundred banks in his time .
coming to the okeechobee exit ...
yes , but i want to hear you tell it . starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this ?
is n't that my report you 're holding onto ?
that 's nice of you to offer , karen , but i got all the help i can use right now . instead , let 's talk about how you got the bump on your head .
i wan na be on the task force , daniel .
daniel burdon , fbi .
hello , daniel .
excuse me , adele ?
daniel burdon , please . karen sisco .
you do n't , huh ?
oh , is that right ? you going to shoot me ? nice girl like you ? i do n't think so .
you can live or die , it 's up to you .
if you move , if you look at her again , you 're dead .
i could walk out of here .
what do you want to bet ?
you would n't shoot me , would you ?
put it down or i 'll shoot .
oh . then this must be adele ...
i 'm a federal marshal and you 're under arrest . put the gun on the table . i mean , now .
wait . you not adele ?
leave it where it is .
i appreciate the offer . and it 's tempting .
you see what they doing , those posts out there ? putting up another fence , five metres on the other side of the one that 's there . we wait until super bowl sunday , they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine , ten days . so we going soon as it 's dark . you want -- i mean it -- you can still come .
you told me i can come 'cause i caught you digging the fuckin ' tunnel , saw you and lulu coming out of the bushes , thought maybe you two were making out .
you want , i tole you you can come . you all right , foley . i like you .
you were out running this morning , sticking to your routine , anybody happened to notice . but you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five . saving yourself for the main event . then i see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni . carbohydrates for endurance .
why you think is today ?
yeah , but i see you moved it up .
i told you , man , super bowl sunday .
you excited ?
wait , i know him -- okay ?
karen , i told you not to --
oh-kay ...
we 're a few minutes away . just sit tight , stay outta the house till we get there , understand ?
hello ?
come on , raymond , i 'm a federal officer , i 'm armed .
that 's fine , but i do n't want you to talk to miller alone .
i 'll need a last known address .
christ , i know snoopy miller . he 's a fuckin ' wackjob thinks he 's sugar ray leonard . hangs out with a couple other grade-a nutcases over on the west side .
guy named maurice miller , also known as snoopy , a former prizefighter .
who was the friend ?
listen , raymond , a year ago , dea had this guy glenn michaels on possession with intent but could n't make it stick . in his statement , glenn said he went up to detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that .
yeah , and , as you can see , home invasions are big , too .
detroit , you must be pretty busy .
yeah , i 'm crimes against persons and property now , also sex crimes and child abuse .
no , i did n't know that .
you know , i 'm not in homicide any more .
i report to the fbi , first thing they 're gon na do is ask me to go get some coffee .
other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together . you gon na tell me why you 're comin ' to me instead of the fbi ?
yonelle . looks like someone raped her , shot her , then threw her out the window . fuckin ' animals .
yeah . i saw one of 'em outside .
yeah , eddie was a real character . had these girls cooked the rocks he called the rockettes .
what is it with crack and transsexuals ?
dude in the dress is eddie solomon , used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself . word on the street was he was saving up for an operation .
who ?
yeah . and i thought everyone liked eddie .
quite a mess .
freezing . but i 'm getting warmer .
how are you , raymond ?
ironic , is n't it ?
you 're right . so why take a chance --
this kind of setup , you do n't have any idea what the fuck you 're doing -- do you ?
a little .
nervous ?
not until recently .
jack , you do n't use a gun , do you ?
someone down here ?
good luck , richard .
i 've seen 'em used on tv .
you know how to use one a these ?
hey . you learn from doing .
that 's a wonderful story , snoop . i 'm very excited about tonight .
takes the tv , the vcr , some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor .
shit , yeah . white boy even got busted for it . white boy , tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time .
so you 've done this before , huh ?
break and enter , shit . take it and git , how it 's done . do n't waste any time . that 's how you do it .
that what they 're wearing these days to break and enter ?
i was n't asking permission .
you got two minutes , that 's all . make up your mind .
give me a minute , talk to buddy .
soon as we leave here . stop home and pick up what we need and go do it .
i thought everything .

we 're leaving .
reggie , push off and hit , man . push him off .
your homie , glenn . only thing , he went to the men 's about a while ago and never came back .
who 's sitting here ?
warm ? man , it 's ninety-five degrees in here , sometimes a hundred -- the way emanuel always kep ' it so his boys 'd sweat , get lean and mean like tommy hearns . no , i ai n't talking any business in here . to me this is holy ground , man . you understand ? i got to be someplace anyway . y'all want to talk , come to the fights tomorrow night , we 'll sit down and look at it good . the state theater .
what 's the matter with right here ? it 's nice and warm .
let 's go outside and talk .
look , snoop , i do n't know what glenn promised you or what you think you 're gon na get , but the deal is me and buddy get half of whatever we take from ripley , understand ? how you and glenn cut up the rest is up to you .
glenn did n't tell you ?
just like it . nobody backing down . you back down , you pussy . tell me what you and buddy doing up here in the cold ?
like being back in the yard , huh ?
low class of people there , snoop .
it seems to me i been reading about you in the newspaper . busted out of some joint in florida , huh ?
snoopy miller , famous fight thrower .

himey here 's a pro-toh-jay of mine . he 's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system .

i do n't know about that . you ca n't do three falls and think you have much of a brain .
you 're not dumb .
i do n't know .
what about < i > my < /i > motive ? now i can say i fucked a us marshal . you think i will ?
or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill . score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade .
why are you mad ?
i want you to know something . i was n't looking for just a fuck , if that 's what you 're thinking .
i 'm just going to the bathroom .
you coming back ?
do n't talk like that , okay ? you scare me .
no , you 're right . or buddy . i wo n't ask if he 's with you or what you 're doing here in detroit . or if you 've run into glenn michaels yet .
i do n't think we should get into that .
so she did help you ?
to warn her about chino .
you were going to see her ?
outside adele 's .
where ?
you know i saw you on the street .
really ? i was thinking the same thing . if we could call time and get together for a while .
i could n't believe it . i was thinking of you by then , a lot , wondering what it would be like if we did meet . like if we could take a time-out ...
i was n't sure you caught that .
you waved to me in the elevator .
i do n't know . i had n't worked that part out yet . all i knew was that i liked you , and i did n't want to leave you there , never see you again .
what were you gon na do with me ?
why not ?
you believe that ?
i hear he did n't mean to . the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart .
he killed a police officer .
i might 've smelled like a sewer , but you could tell i was a gentleman . they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy .
yeah , but in a nice way .
you kept touching me , feeling my thigh .
she did , huh .
remember how talkative you were ? in the trunk ? adele said you do that when you 're nervous .
that 's not what you were about to say .
you really wear that suit .
so do you .
you like taking risks .
it would be worth the risk .
if i remembered you . i came looking for you . i would 've said sure , let 's do it . but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team . why would you trust me ?
well , i 'd say who i was and do you remember me and ask if you 'd like to meet for a drink .
if i had answered , what were you gon na say ?
i called your room from downstairs .
oh , god ...
or once .
it does n't have to , it 's something that happens . it 's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds , there 's a kind of recognition . like you both know something . but then the next moment the person 's gone , and it 's too late to do anything about it , but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go , and you think , `` what if i had stopped and said something ? '' it might happen only a few times in your life .
well , does it make sense to you ?
it 's not a game . something you play .
it 's your game . i 've never played this before .
i do n't think it works if we 're somebody else . you know what i mean ? gary and celeste , jesus , what do they know about anything ?
not yet . do n't say anything yet . okay ?
how far do we go with this ?
no . what do you do for a living , gary ?
having it cleaned did n't help , huh ?
it smelled .
you did ?
i had one just like it -- well , it was the same idea , but i had to get rid of it .
i like your hair . and that suit .
i do n't have a problem with it .
a girl .
what , as a sales rep ?
is that how you think of yourself ?
i 'm a sales rep. i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i 'm a girl .
well , we got that out of the way . tell me , celeste . what do you do for a living ?
love it .
you like bourbon ?
no , they 're all right . i meant , you just got here .
those guys bother you ?
do n't leave me .
i can go to the bar .
it takes hours to get a drink around here . there 's only one waitress .
i just thought maybe you and me could --
whatta you mean < u > we 'll < /u > make it an island ?
i 'm partial to mountains myself . but if you like islands , we 'll make it an island .
one last score , that the idea ? move to some island .
he 's dead . he did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital , i think trying to make up for all the good times he 'd missed . that 's not gon na be me .
unless you wan na tell me .
why ? you think he might tell you where i am ?
something i 've been wondering , what ever happened to your uncle cully ?
i can just picture that , a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters .
my dad 's retired . he was a private investigator . forty years . i used to work for him .
because you 're having too much fun .
why not ?
you wo n't do that .
there 's a guy here on the task force right now . maybe i should put him on the phone , let you two work it out .
sure . i 'll just leave 'em with the s.w.a.t . guy answers the door .
let 's see . you could come on by my dad 's place , drop 'em off .
how do we do that ?
think i could have them back ?
and your gun .
how do you know ? wait -- you have my wallet .
really . he has a cop 's face .
that 's my dad .
i 'm just worried maybe i 'm not old enough for you .
none of your business .
who was it answered the phone ?
how 'd you get this number ?
yes .
you know who this is ?
shit ...
get your hands up and turn around . < u > now < /u > .
uh-huh . well , but if --
i mean , romantically .
really .
i never thought it made sense , though , the way they got together so quick .
yeah ...
with robert redford , when he was young .
another one faye dunaway was in i liked , < i > three days of the condor < /i > .
you have to be kidding .
i 'm just saying i think if we met under different circumstances ...
you 'd probably tell me .
i mean if you did n't know who i was .
nothing .
you 're sure easy to talk to . i wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking , say you were in a bar and i came up to you -- i wonder what would happen .
it was n't pretty after , no , but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you would n't have known what hit you .
bleeding on a country road .
yeah , right . anyway , that scene where warren beatty and faye dunaway get shot ? i remember thinking at the time it would n't be a bad way to go , if you have to .
peter finch .
and the guy saying he was n't gon na take any more shit from anybody ...
< i > network < /i > . yeah , she was good .
yeah , i liked her in that movie about tv ...
faye dunaway .
that part in the movie where they get shot ? warren beatty and ... i ca n't think of her name .
it was may , 1934 , near gibsland , louisiana .
you 're full of interesting facts , are n't you ?
they put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in clyde , bonnie parker and the car they were driving . bonnie was eating a sandwich .
is that right ?
i do n't recall his hat , but i 've seen pictures of him lying dead , shot by texas rangers . did you know he did n't have his shoes on ?
oh , you mean of bonnie and clyde ? hm . you ever see pictures of him , the way he wore his hat ? you could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him .
you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow .
yeah , well , if it turns out i get shot like a dog , it 'll be in the street , not off a goddamn fence .
you know , this is n't gon na end well , these things never do .
sure .
we still talk , though .
uh-huh .
it was just a year , give or take a few days . i mean , it 's not like we did n't get along or anything . we had fun , we just did n't have that ... that thing , you know ? that spark , you know what i mean ? you got ta have that .
you were married ? all those falls , i 'm surprised you had time .
jesus , you sound like my ex-wife .
what do you want me to do ? scream ? i do n't think it would help much . i 'm just gon na sit back , take it easy , and wait for you to screw up .
you do n't act like it .
of course i am .
you do n't seem all that scared .
i do n't have to . i do n't rob banks .
basically . yeah . if i go back now , i do a full thirty years , no time off . can you imagine looking at that ?
i know the difference . you were in lompoc usp , the federal penitentiary . i 've delivered people there . so basically you 've spent half your life in prison .
i believe you would have . another fall , i did seven years at lompoc . and i do n't mean the place next door where some of nixon 's people went .
it was me , i woulda left ol ' gus on the floor .
i thought so , too .
that 's funny .
tell you the truth , i do n't know . i started when i was eighteen , driving for my uncle cully and his partner , gus . they go into a bank this one time in slidell , gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg . all three of us ended up in angola .
how many was that ?
time i was convicted in california ? fbi told me i 'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer .
why , are you famous ?
jack foley . you 've probably heard of me .
so , what 's < u > your < /u > name ? it 'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway .
one i gave him , yeah . fuck ...
buddy . that 's his given name ?
who , buddy ? yeah . he 's a good guy . back when we jailed together , he 'd call his sister every week without fail . she 's a born-again christian , does bookkeeping for a televangelist . buddy calls her up , confesses his sins , tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob .
must be quite a pal , risk his own ass like this .
if they get set up in time , which i doubt . and even if they do they 'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas , not a big black guy driving a ford .
you would n't have time anyway . we come to a roadblock , they 'll run the car , find out in five seconds who it belongs to .
guys like me , huh . well , listen , even though i 've been celibate lately , i 'm not gon na force myself on you . i 've never done that in my life .
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me .
yeah , went real nice with that twelve gauge , too . tell me , why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall ?
i believe it . you 've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me .
boy , it stunk in there .
in my bag , in the car .
where 's your gun , your pistol ?
you devil , it 's mace , huh ? what 've you got here , a billy ? use it on poor unfortunate offenders .
for your breath . you could use it . squirt some in your mouth .
there is n't any . all this shit you got in here . what is all this stuff anyway ? handcuffs , chains ... what 's this can ?
if i could have a little more room .
you comfy ?
i 'm a federal marshal and you 're under arrest , both of you guys .
why you 're just a girl . what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun ?
why ? just because you left us standing on the side of the road ?
i thought you guys were busted .
these guys , man , they 're crazy . shit .
whose blood you got all over you ?
i do n't know ...
what happened to your shades ? someone finally step on 'em ?
yeah ? she said that to you ?
she < i > knew < /i > me from some bullshit dope bust . she drove me to court . twice . you know what she said , we 're in the car on the turnpike ? `` i never forget anybody i 've cuffed and shackled . ''
that broad you picked up -- did you know she was a us marshal , for christ sake ?
were n't you expecting us ?
the backseat .
in the trunk ?
i 'd like you to go wait in the car . how 's that ? take her with you and put her in back .
you 're in civilization now , man , ease up .
wait in the car .
you do n't take 'em off , i 'm gon na throw 'em off the overpass while they 're still on your head .
i see better with them on .
take your sunglasses off .
oh , nuthin ' .
studs . man , i have n't heard that since lompoc . what 's going on ?
oh , hey , studs ? we thought you were somebody else .
use your head . the guys got five million lying around his house , you really think he 's gon na tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it ?
you think he 's lying ?
my point is , that 's probably what you 're gon na end up with .
so . what 's your point ?
ever seen an uncut diamond , studs ? they look like plain old rocks .
detroit . snoopy miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash .
i 'll take the shades off . just get this fuckin ' thing off me .
i guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights .
you guys -- come on -- this is too heavy !
who you talkin ' to , studs ? me , or buddy . i ca n't tell , you got those shades on .
he got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check . like that , fifty mil , signed his name . whoa -- little help here !
i do , but i wo n't tell you just yet . meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty , right before lock-down .
you know who they are ?
looks like tonight .
when ?
i hear six .
okay . how many going out ?
i expect you to look out for me , pup , let me run off work details .
how many ?
some people are going out of here . what if i told you where and when ?
if that 's my fate , so be it . i 'm not leaving . i love her , jack .
do n't be an asshole , richard . they 're gon na kill you .
i 'm not leaving midge .
i were you , i 'd get up and run .
five point two .
dumbfuck glenn was right , there 's about five million worth in there , would n't you say , richard ?
i 'm not angry , richard . in fact , i 'm completely relaxed . thing is , i ca n't tell if it 's the fish that 're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there .
i ca n't believe you 're still angry with me , jack , after all this time .
siddown , dick . they 're trying to open the safe , not your maid .
good god ... they 're shooting midge !
we 'll go to my bank . i 'll make a withdrawal .
you gon na write me a check ?
what do you want from me , jack ? name it . you want money ?
a minute or two , you 're gon na wish you were .
we thought it might be her husband . sometimes he comes and checks up on her . she told him i was down in florida .
what kinda man lets a woman answer the door , this time a night ?
have they got midge up there ?
maurice ? from lompoc ? good god .
maurice miller , couple of his friends .
jesus christ , what the hell are you doing here ? what 's going on ? who 's upstairs ?
how are you , richard ?
foley ? that you ?
oh , yeah , i 'm calm . in fact , i 'm totally `` relaxed ... ''
gentlemen . i think we 've calmed down now . have n't we , jack ?
jack , i 'm disappointed . i guess i misjudged you .
how , dick ? the way < u > you < /u > earned it ? by marrying some rich broad owns the company , selling it off a piece at a time , then divorcing her ? what is this knute rockne , pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit ? back in prison , guy like you , place like that , you were ice cream for freaks . you were a goddamn dumpling . maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing . till you < u > were < /u > nothing . i saved your ass . so you 'll pardon me if i do n't wan na sit on a fuckin stool all day saying `` sign in here please '' or `` hey , pal , you ca n't park there . '' okay , dick ? i ca n't do it .
today , i 'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage . you think you 're better than that ? fine . show me . show me that you 're really willing to change and we 'll talk about something better . a lot better . but first , jack , you got ta earn it .
first , i 'm goin ' to israel for a year , study the talmud , work on a kibbutz ... then come back , maybe take some tennis lessons .
you goin ' right back to work ?
what 's to think about ?
i still have n't made up my mind yet .
the next time i walk into a bank .
it works . you should try it sometime .
and the guy sent you a bill for this ?
the fish saved my life . two years ago , i found out i had high blood pressure . so my doctor , he tells me to go get an aquarium , look at the fish every time i felt myself stressing out .
i ca n't say that i 've paid that much attention to 'em before .
yeah , fish live in the present . they do n't dwell on yesterday and they do n't worry about tomorrow . even when a big fish attacks a little fish , there 's no neurosis involved . no guilt afterward . no whining on some fish-shrink 's couch . they just do it . they accept .
the fish ?
no need to decide now . be like the fish . let whatever happens happen .
my ex-wife 's in miami . it 's nice down there .
who is ? but then you got ta look at a job as more than just work . you got ta look at it as peace of mind . as < i > security < /i > , you know what i mean ? i got offices in detroit , miami , boston , take your pick .
i do n't know . i 'm not exactly the nine-to-five type .
hey , jack ? bullshit . i did n't make my first million until i was forty- two . forty-two . you really < u > want < /u > to change , it 's never too late .
it 's a little late for me .
i was just thinking that i could use a guy like you , someone knows how to ask for things the right way . i 'm talkin ' about when you 're outta here . i mean , you ca n't rob banks for ever .
twenty-two months , three days , two hours . why ?
tell me something , jack , how much longer you in here ?
it 's a big house .
does n't have to figure out shit . you < u > told < /u > him you keep 'em at your house .
plus , even it was true , he 'd still have to figure out where i keep 'em .
of course not .
yeah , but who 's gon na believe glenn ? i mean , do < u > you < /u > believe glenn ?
you 're the one with balls , dick , say something like that to someone like glenn . or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute .
i know what you 're talking about .
no ? where do you keep it , dick ? i 'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told glenn about .
you 're the reason , jack , i do n't keep all my money in banks .
you 'd be surprised what all you can get , you ask for it the right way .
really ?
i do n't know . i never used a gun .
tell me something . what 's it like , walk in a bank with a gun , stick it up ?
any time .
thanks for your help .
first of all , if he kills you , he 's not gon na get any more money out of you .
really ? well , i uhhh ...
you 're smart , ripley , you 'll tell this guy to fuck off .
must be a real soft pillow .
sounds high , does n't it ?
oh , uh , right , thanks ...
you do n't wan na be standing there , the hacks start asking questions you do n't wan na answer .
i do n't know . it 's a long way down to florida .
like what ?
yeah , could be . or maybe she thought we 'd have a lot to talk about .
cheaper i guess , take us both down in one van .
she did , huh .
apparently , yeah . i was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal , but for some reason she wanted to wait .
and so now you 're off to glades .
hejira .
you must be some kinda walker , henry .
ten , you count the prison hospital in ohio i walked away from .
the < u > ninth < /u > ?
yeah . that was the ninth .
there were others .
that time ?
and how long was it before they caught up with you ?
i prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place .
you busted out ?
meaning time came , i left .
meaning ?
for a time .
you were at leavenworth , huh ?
the brothers in leavenworth gave me the name .
the flight ?
the hejira was the flight of mohammed from mecca in 622 .
what 's it mean , `` no hair '' ?
islamic .
< i > hejira ? < /i > what kinda name is that ?
if i did n't know you , glenn , by tomorrow you 'd be in jail or dead . look at it that way . go on .
i know , you 'll find me . jesus , i believe it . i keep thinking if you had n't driven me to federal court last summer , you would n't even know who i am .
but listen , glenn . if you 're lying to me ...
really ?
you want to get out of here , run , it 'll warm you up .
i 'm freezing my ass off .
gee , i wonder why not .
i do n't know -- he does n't exactly confide in me .
but you say he has n't shown up , you think he backed out ?
maurice is gon na kill him , try and collect the reward .
why 's that ?
he 's supposed to be , but he has n't shown up yet , which is a good thing for him .
and is foley a part of this ?
yeah , the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow , take him out to his house in bloomfield hills . now , i do n't give a shit what they do .
ripley ? you mean the wall street guy ?
rippin ' off ripley was my idea , but these guys , man , they 're into shit i ca n't handle .
but i thought the whole thing was your idea ?
nothing . i just wan na get the fuck outta here .
what 's going on , glenn ?
listen , these guys , they 're gon na be out here any minute looking for me . they 're fucking animals .
for the car , for aiding and abetting a prison escape , and conspiring to do whatever you came here for .
you 're gon na bust me for picking up a car ?
glenn , i know your life history , who your friends are , where you 've been and now , it looks like , where you 're going . put your hands on the wheel .
jesus . how 'd you know about snoopy ?
the two guys you were with -- that one , that is n't maurice miller , is it ? i 've seen snoopy 's mug shot and that did n't look like him .
i already stole it . last week or whenever it was , in west palm . i ca n't be stealing it again , can i ?
you 're not ?
i mean i 'm not stealing the fucking car .
another one of those days , huh , nothing seems to go right ?
jesus , i do n't believe it .
glenn , are you trying to steal this car ?
no way , man , no fuckin ' way am i gon na turn myself in .
glenn , take the exit .
what am i supposed to do < u > now < /u > ?
take the next exit .
wait . < i > have < /i > you helped him , glenn ? at this point , technically , i doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive . so you still have a choice . you can help him and risk going down again , get cuffed and shackled , hope to god you pull a reasonable judge , not some hard-on . or , if you want to play it another way ...
we 're not . i 'm helping him , yeah --
look , i can understand if you and foley are close .
foley 's not going to make it . and if he goes down , glenn , you go with him .
i remember you now . shit .
do we have a gun in the car ?
last fall , i drove you from the palm beach county jail to the federal courthouse , twice . you 're glenn michaels . i never forget anyone i 've cuffed and shackled .
but you 're sure we 've met , huh ?
no , that 's not what i 'm thinking .
it could n't have been out at glades , if that 's what you 're thinking . i was never out there .
you do n't remember me , do you ?
glenn ?
i got a big score lined up up north . they would n't even know about it , it was n't for me . i could do it right now myself , except it 's so fucking cold up there in january --
jesus , what 'd you crawl through , a sewer ?
i 'll send it to you at glades .
why would i do that ?
no . you gon na stay close to me from now on . so you do n't disappear on me .
it 's all right with you , i 'll just hang in the car .
yeah , kenneth , why you have to do that to that poor girl .
why 'd he have to do that to that girl ?
that was some shit , huh ?
hey , shit , come on . i say i want this car , man , it 's mine . you go get yourself another one . i say i 'm in on ripley ? i 'm in , with or without < i > your < /i > ass . i say i want you to come along on another job , see if you for real or not , guess what you gon na do ?
i think you 're forgetting , this is my car . i drove it up here .
look , glenn , i know you cool , but you do n't have to give me no tone of voice , okay ? you do n't like what i 'm saying , you can get out anywhere along here you want .
i do n't have to prove shit to you . the ripley job is < i > my < /i > job . you 're either in or you 're not . you wan na pop some crack dealer pissed you off , that 's your problem , not mine .
right now , son .
what -- when ?
walk in a house with me , do this cross- dressin ' nigga named eddie solomon i used to sell to been dealin ' on his own .
can i do what ?
yeah . if you can step up and actually do it . understand ? 'stead of just talking the talk .
me ?
thing i 'm worried about is you .
you just ask me how we gon na do it . that 's what i 'm here for , tell you how . we the experts .
wait a minute . i 'm letting < i > you < /i > in on this , not all your friends .
what ?
i 'll show you , soon as i get one more guy i 'm gon na need , moselle 's brother , kenneth . along with white boy there .
so you still have n't said , how you wan na do it ?
if they 're not busted now , they 're gon na be . it 's wide open .
you sure foley and his pal are n't coming up here , do this themself ?
it 's lilac , man , the color , and the style 's made known by deion and other defensive backs in the pros . i could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players . okay , here comes mr. ripley 's house up on the left . yeah . the brick wall . there 's his drive , right there .
sure , right , they see bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna , no , they wo n't think anything of it .
watch the road , boy . i like this town car . we can cruise the man 's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass .
oh , i 'm here , all right . i 'm very here . question is , why are n't < u > you < /u > here ?
you there ?
it 's richard ripley .

well , < i > he < /i > ai n't even here that much . i like to know where he goes , but at the same time i do n't < i > want < /i > to know , you understand ?
he said he stayed with maurice .
here ? in this house ?
he said he stayed here last november .
glenn ? no , i do n't know any glenn .
no , i 'm not . maybe you know him . glenn michaels ?
you a lawyer ?
no .
you not with probation , one of those ?
i 'm looking for a friend of mine i think maurice knows .
thanks .
you like to sit down ?
that 's kenneth , my brother . he 's talking on the phone .
that 's not maurice ?
you find him , tell him the dog got run over and i 'm out of grocery money .
i 'm looking for maurice .
what do you want ?
moselle miller ?
my little girl , the tough babe .
he knew what he was doing . nobody forced him to rob banks .
i was just thinking ... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude , or whatever you call it , left off . and then throw him in the can .
it 's possible . why ?
you gon na go get him ?
none i 'd like to share .
he does n't seem to hold a grudge . what < i > i < /i > want to know is why , they got such a big score up north , did foley hang around miami for so long ? any thoughts on that one ?
so what i want to know is why buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in .
so ?
buddy 's sister regina mary bragg got two calls from buddy up in detroit this morning , called burdon . she 's also the one gave burdon buddy 's address .
i imagine you would 've though .
i did n't have time .
you wave back ?
i could n't swear to it , but i 'm pretty sure he did .
he waved to you ?
yeah , but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike . it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping .
foley < i > kid < /i > napped me .
you like the wild ones , do n't you ? tillman , nicolet and now foley . you know , i 've always said there 's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers , all those guys that love to pack .
my married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity . i could n't believe it .
maybe . but you 're also curious about the man . twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him . you were concerned , but you did n't want to show it .
i want to bust his ass , put him in shackles .
but you know he 's dirty and you still wan na see him again .
not at all .
he remind you of that guy , tillman ?
he 's pretty laid back , confident .
remember , pay attention to how she talks about foley , her tone . do it right , she 'll tell you things she would n't tell burdon . tell her you think he 's a nice guy . no , first tell her about being in the trunk with him , in the dark for half an hour , and see how she takes it . if she 's in on it , what does she get for all the aggravation ; cops breathing on her ? i bet nothing . so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out . you think that 's possible ? what kind of guy is he ?
hello ?
hello ? yeah , she is . just a minute . for you .
off a tip ?
was it foley ?
i see that .
ray 's with the f.b.i . task force , working on the prison break .
no , he looks a lot ...
no ?
he does n't even look like that .
tell you what , you 're a good girl , you might get another one for christmas .
the sig sauer you got me for my birthday .
what are you thinking about ?
huh .
`` hey , yourself . ''
what 'd i say ?
you were talking in your sleep .
i 'd like that .
how 'bout i come next sunday and watch the super bowl with you ?
we do n't get to talk much any more .
i really got ta go .
you 'd meet doctors , lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they 're divorced . why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife ? that 's the way those hotshots are , all of 'em .
dad ...
you used to like it .
no thanks .
you know you can always step in , work with me full-time as one of my investigators .
serving process , a summons and complaint . some con doing mandatory life does n't like macaroni and cheese . he files suit , says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights .
what 're you doing at glades ?
can we change the subject ?
then they 're not separated , are they ?
he 's about to .
oh , he 's moved out ?
technically . they 're separated .
he 's still married though , huh ?
he was . ray 's with the f.b.i . now , he switched over .
which one is that ? the atf guy ?
ca n't . i got ta drive out to glades , then i 'm meeting ray nicolet at ten .
happy birthday , kid . you want another coke ?
thanks , dad .
-- sig-sauer .38. i love it .
it 's a --
it 's beautiful .
something better . open it .
you fit another chanel suit in here ?
the combination is three-ten-forty-four .
a'ight , this time we got ta get the motherfuckin ' trajectory right ... okay , on three : one ... two ...
like a fag .
how do i look , mama ?
let 's go upstairs , have a look at the man 's bedroom . all right now , you and mr. buddy check the rooms down here . look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it . look at the walls in the closets . the man has a safe , it 's gon na be up there somewhere .
i do n't have any idea .
where 's ripley 's safe at , he keep his valuables in .
that 's right , just me .
you here all by yourself ?
when 's he due back ?
he 's in florida . palm beach .
out for the evening ?
i told you , he is n't here .
not yet . where 's mr. ripley ?
so the woman 's married . she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it . but you do n't reveal her name , you protect her . it sounds like you 're saying it 's okay as long as her husband does n't find out about it . like the guy who cheats on his wife , saying what she does n't know wo n't hurt her .
the woman also said he stole her husband 's gun , a twenty-two pistol , and some of his clothes .
that 's how you score now ?
i spoke to her . the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him .
... she fixes him pork chops and rice , the next thing you know they 're making love on the sofa . she says he was very gentle .
yeah , as soon as we got back .
did you pay the guy the reward ?
i knew it , soon as i saw they were offering a reward .
yeah , someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport , called the number --
no . course not .
in case no one knows what he does . tell me , ray , you ever wear one says , `` undercover '' ?
likewise .
i 've heard a lot about you , mr. sisco .
where the fuck is foley ?
foley 's got it .
forget about her . tell me where the money 's at .
midge .
where you been hiding , dick ?
are those < i > my < /i > suits ?
well , if it is n't the ripper hisself .
yeah . sure . it 's all settled .
excuse me . snoopy ? did we settle the fish thing ?
still ...
faux goose down .
... and that extra pillow 's gon na be an even three c 's .
well , i need that ...
that bausch & lomb saline shit you asked for is gon na be eighty bucks .
whoever . the point is , prices are goin ' up , too . better get your little black book out , richard . we got some business to talk about .
i think it 's dunn & < u > brad < /u > street . but then , i could be wrong ...
year ago , i come in here on credit card fraud , but after i shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day , my dunn & broadstreet , has gone way the fuck up .
what ?
not so fast , dick . starting now , there 's gon na be an across the board cost a living increase .
thank you ...
are they dead ?
... the fuck is this ...
white boy , the man 's not gon na hide no diamonds under the fuckin ' mattress .
i found a rubber .
i sent these two looking for him , they come back shaking their heads .
i think he must 've fell in .
uh-huh . you recall , did it say dead or alive ?
ten gees .
white boy , how much is the reward on the man again ?
jack foley , famous bank robber .
we have a problem here ?
he 's been like that all day . hey danny , you coming ?
what is it with red ? i 've never seen him this way .
if evelyn 's here , the rest are here !
are you sure they 're here ?
no , numbnuts , die . you get your nurse alone , you look her in the eye , and say , `` baby , they 're training me for war , and i do n't know what 'll happen . but if i die tomorrow , i wan na know that we lived all we could tonight . '' i 've never known it to fail .
what , good-lookin ' sumbitch ?
that 's your line for tonight , ya know .
you good-lookin ' sumbitch ... do n't you ever die !
you do n't forget love , honey . not ever .
i wish she could forget him .
no , i was .
he was that good ?
now listen , it 's hands off billy . i mean , you can put your hands on him if you want to , but then my hands will break yours .
ooo , she 's thinking of her date ! come on , you 've been dating a pilot . we want to know what we can expect .
we 'll ask evelyn . evelyn ? evelyn !
hide them ? on a date with pilots ? i 'm talking about how you make them show !
you mean hiding them ?
do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform ?
yeah . but if i have to get something out , i c-can always s-s-s- siiing !
nervous ?
only when i 'm n-n-n-
do you always stutter ?
how would i know .
but ... they called you strange ? because of red grange ? i do n't get it . was red grange strange ?
you know the football player , red g- grange ? well the guys called me r-red , cause you know , i 'm red ... and they thought i was strange , so , you know , red g-grange , red str-strange .
red ... strange ?
he , i 'm r-red . red s-strange .
not anxious to die , sir , anxious to matter .
are all the yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed , lieutenant ?
if you 're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway , maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes .
good on you , then , rafe mccawley . we 'll get you situated in some quarters , and then introduce you to the equipment you 'll be flying .
that 's me , sir .
on loan from colonel doolittle , is it ?
i was n't gon na apologize , sir . i was just gon na say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again , even if it was only for five seconds .
too late for apologies , walker .
sir , i --
you 'll love it . no base , no bars , just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance .
hale-what ?
i do n't buy that hot dog shit . so you and your buddies are gon na transfer your planes up to haleiwa .
sir ?
oh yeah . i liked it so much i 'm cutting you out of the squadron .
you liked that ?
that was a nice little stunt you pulled , buzzing the base .
yes sir .
you 're walker , right ?
you guys know her ? ! i got ta have an intro ! man , i 'd like to --
rafe 's girl , evelyn ?
mai-tai 's . i got this to tell ya , about mai-tai 's .
yeah .
what the hell happened to you guys ?
the one that slept in my mouth last night .
what lizard ?
where 's that lizard ?
hey . you . mr. coma .
yeah , but he was wearing shoes !
well , you p-puked on his feet .
shit , he 's puking on my feet !
you guys are new ?
i th-think i 'm gon na like it here .
no , like ...
a m-missionary ?
ever hear of mai-tai 's ? comes in a big ... pot . like ... like ...
he did .
who the fuck taught you to fly ?
anthony , red , stay with the guns ! coma , you cover the cannons ! joe , theo , come with us ! earl , you get on the radio ! we 're gon na fight these fuckers .
danny , i do n't like this fuckin ' guy .
of the four left , only one is full of fuel .
earl ! you said the planes were ready but -- but what ?
you guys get those ! earl , rafe , come with me !
cock-suckin ' right i do ! ! in the gun lockers !
they 'll all fly , but -- oh , shit ...
they ready , earl ?
yes you can .
i ca n't make it .
danny ...
home of the brave .
and i 'm on yours . land of the free .
we 'll get separated over the target , but you and i will rendezvous for the run to china . i 'm on your wing .
broomsticks instead of tail guns .
longer ? it 's getting shorter .
it 's not getting any longer .
we 'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel . i got another chinese phrase for doolittle . `` mug wump rickshaw mushu pork . '' it means `` who the fuck thought up this shit ? ''
they 'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch . that 'll help .
it 's shorter than our practice runway .
what 's between you and her is between you and her . but here 's what 's between you and me . everybody has a hero , danny . and you 're mine .
maybe just trying to measure up .
bullshit . we 've played with each other , pushed each other . this is different . like you want to prove that you 're better than me . who 's that for -- evelyn ?
we 've always tried to beat each other .
no . you 're trying to beat me .
what do you mean ? i 'm just doing what we 've always done .
danny , what the hell are you trying to do out there ?
fun today . like old times .
what color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral ?
sorry you 're gon na die -- cause i 'm gon na make it .
i 'm out of fuel !
i 'm out of ammo !
home of the brave .
land of the free .
little less .
i got a half a tank . you ?
yeah . so you can call me if you need help .
you hear my okay ?
bet they do n't dust crops in japan .
they 're all over us !
tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season . do n't hit the barn .
it 's tight .
they 're coming around for another pass . you got extra weapons and ammo ?
this ai n't a little feud , earl , it 's world war two !
six p-40 's .
what 's there ?
auxiliary field at haleiwa , ten miles north of here .
where are we going ?
come on !
get me into a plane !
how sweet . is that when you put the move on her ?
she said i was so much like you . i said , no , i 'm not . i 'm like i am because of you , but i 'm not you , not as good as you . everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder . but you saw the better part of me , the part of me that could be like you , and changed me . you made me who i am .
she loves you . i know that . and part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me .
fuck you .
do n't blame her , rafe . it 's not like you 're thinking .
i guess i 'm used to it . i 've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back .
how come you 're not pukin ' ?
how 's this for a fact ? i loved her first .
you left her . how 's that for a fact ?
i 'm saying now you do know . so it 's time for you to fuck off .
so what are you saying ?
yeah , right . anyway , you did n't know .
i was grieving too .
i understand how it could happen . i know why any guy would love her . and i ca n't blame you that it happened . you thought i was dead , she was grieving , you were trying to help her .
what facts are those ?
we got ta face some facts here .
if you ca n't keep up , do n't drink yours .
you do n't wan na put beer over mai-tai .
waitress ! four beers !
sure you did . so come on . say what you think .
i did n't mean it .
why be sorry ? that 's what you feel , it 's better to come out with it .
sorry .
let 's go get a drink . unless you 're scared to talk about it .
upset ? why should i be upset ?
you 'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset .
it 's a test . if i asked her to come and she came , it would n't tell me anything . if i tell her not to come , and she comes ... then i know she loves me .
then why are you looking for her ?
yeah .
did n't you say you told her not to come ?
some other time . i do n't feel like a party .
i have to talk to evelyn . and i want you to meet her .
nah , you go on .
danny , you know how many times i saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose , and could n't do a thing about it -- for you , or for your mother ... or your father , with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas , and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit ? you 've made your sacrifice , danny . it 's time i made mine .
do n't make this a joke , rafe . you 're talking about war , and i know what war does to people .
i 'm sorry , danny , but they 're only accepting the best pilots .
i do n't mean how 'd you do the paperwork , i mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it ?
the colonel helped me work it out .
how could you do this ?
hey , you wan na test my limits , you better line up a couple dozen women on the ground ... cause i got no limits in the air !
did n't you say test the limits ?
there 's another one !
home of the brave !
land of the free ...
good shooting , rafe !
good shooting , danny !
kill the bastards !
it 's germans !
power dive !
bandits at 2 o'clock .
we got a saying here . a-low-ha !
yeah .
who 's gon na to that ? japan is four thousand miles away . so you guys just arrived , huh ?
what about easier to hit in an air raid ?
the brass is afraid of sabotage . this makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service .
hey ! what is this , the planes all bunched up like that ?
hang on .
so beautiful !
from the air ?
well ... sure .
hey , have you seen pearl harbor at night ?
he told me he did n't want to leave me with regret . now that 's all i have .
sorry .
i swore not to talk about him tonight , but there 's all this stuff i think i ought to tell you , that he did n't get a chance to . rafe was ... he was lonely . he had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty . the week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter , and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring .
i was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes . do you think that 's why we 're meeting . to help us say goodbye to rafe ?
that might not have been such a good idea . they 're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield . the real punishment is that i wo n't be back to the barracks till it 's too late for dinner or coffee . so i guess it 's goodbye for awhile .
we got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident , but it 's quiet . except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us .
how 's everything ?
... he said that ?
he said you 're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him .
i taught him to drink beer . he taught me how to fly .
you were more like brothers .
rafe 's folks had a crop dusting business , owned their own planes . real straight , frugal . my father was the town drunk . went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the dawn express came along . rafe and i were the only ones at the funeral . he took me back to his house , and i never left .
he told me about you . that he had no other friend like you .
before rafe left , he asked me to be the one to tell you , if it happened .
were . is n't that what you mean ? were . because he 's dead , is n't he ? and that 's why you 've come .
lieutenant ... i 'm danny walker . i 'm rafe mccawley 's best friend .
y-yes sir .
no baseball diamonds , red .
colonel , to f-fight you need strategy . to have strategy , ya got ta practice . and to practice it , ya got ta play --
i 'd like to bomb their emperor too . but i think that 'd just piss 'em off . the idea here , gentlemen , is not revenge . we 're here to prove to them that they 're neither invincible nor superior . so let 's try this again . military targets only .
i d-do n't think japs ought'a be allowed to p-play baseball .
now we have fifteen requests for the emperor 's palace ... and one for tokyo baseball stadium .
i have a phrase i want you all to memorize : `` lushu hoo megwa fugi . '' it means `` i am an american . '' in chinese .
then wh-where do we land ?
we wo n't have the fuel to get back to the carriers ; they 'll turn and run back to hawaii the minute we 're airborne .
c-colonel , we been p-practicing takeoff 's , but i ai n't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks .
the navy will get us to within 400 miles of the japanese coast . we 'll launch off the carriers from there .
and where 's the secret base , sir ? the one we t-takeoff from .
i know .
colonel ... we 're all going . whether you make it or not .
listen you guys . i 'm the first plane -- then mccawley , walker , the rest of you . i 'll have the shortest run . if i do n't make it , you do n't go .
i take it back , about the flowers . we 're all gon na die .
i thought i 'd made it clear , i 'm not just putting this mission together -- i 'm leading it myself .
i want to introduce a couple of people . doc white is a flight surgeon ; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission , because we ca n't spare the weight of an extra man .
bombers .
in flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes . you 'll be flying multi-engines here .
top secret means you help me pick the other pilots , train , and go -- without knowing where you 're going until it 's too late .
well sure , colonel --
you 're just about the only pilots in the army with actual combat experience , so you 're volunteering for a mission i 've been ordered to put together . do you know what top secret is ?
is that the good new , sir , or --
explain what ?
we can explain , colonel .
i heard what you did .
thank you , sir .
good luck over there mccawley . i admire your decision .
thank you , sir .
that 's bullshit , son . but it 's really good bullshit .
never , sir . i just meant it 's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off , rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit . and all you 've done for me , sir , working out the transfer , i did it to say thanks . to honor you , sir . what the french call a `` homage . ''
do n't get smart with me , son .
how could it be irresponsible , sir , if you were the first man in the world to do it ?
there are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible .
you too , 'mam .
you take care , dorie .
i left my mama and joined the navy to be a man . they made me a cook -- and not even that , really -- i clean up after the other sailors eat . i shine the officer 's shoes . in two years , they 've never even let me fire a gun .
tell me something , dorie . a man as big as you -- and smart too , you knew where to come when your ship could n't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect ?
thank you , 'mam .
respect .
what do you get for winning ?
every other sunday . i 'm heavyweight champion of the west virginia .
how often you fight like this ?
i 'm evelyn . and i 'm just a nurse . but i 'm not playing golf , and that cut needs sewing , or else it 's gon na make a big lumpy scar . whatta ya say ?
dorie miller , 'mam .
what 's your name ?
yes 'm .
win ?
boxin ' .
how 'd you get this ?
wait , let me look at that ... you better come in here .
sorry to trouble you .
our doctor 's gone too .
'scuse me , 'mam . all the ship 's doctors is golfing , and i could n't find nobody to look at this .
it was . i could n't have you go away , wherever it is ... to war ... without knowing something . you think i made a choice , of danny over you . i did n't . i did n't have a choice . i 'm pregnant .
it must of been a convincing letter .
they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along . i wrote colonel doolittle , and told him i needed to see you before you go .
what ? ...
that 's what i have to tell you , rafe . it was n't a choice . it --
of course i forgive you . i know what you feel for danny is real . and your choice is your choice .
rafe ... no . you forgive me .
i need to tell you something . i did n't know what it was to lose somebody , to see death and find how much it scares you . that you have n't lived and loved enough . i did n't understand . forgive me .
rafe --
there 's nothing you can do here , they 'll die or they wo n't , we just --
what else can we do ?
it 's not that i did n't mean everything i wrote . it 's just that -- i thought you were dead . and now --
do n't worry about that . guys away from home , lonely , good-hearted women try to cheer them up .
it 's not your fault , rafe . the letter i wrote you , they --
it 's all right . danny always said i see things with my emotions instead of my eyes .
i 'm so sorry for what you must 've gone through , but i 'm back .
it 's been ... so different , being so sure you were dead .
nothing that wo n't heal . i guess .
i 'm just ... so amazed , so glad to know that you 're okay . you are okay , are n't you ?
i called my folks , then colonel doolittle . the colonel sent a man to pick me up . they wanted to debrief me . i told the colonel i needed to see somebody first , and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour . i 've done a lot of talking . you have n't said anything .
... survive ? i jumped in a patch of fog , and nobody could see me . i hit the water hard . and it was so ... cold .
how did you ? ...
i saw you , i could n't go in , i ... just stood there wondering if you knew . you looked ... sad , and i had to sit down a minute .
why were you sitting here , instead of ...
i sent telegrams , i guess the military traffic held them up .
do one thing for me , before you go .
maybe not . but i need you to know . i love you . and i will come back . i 'll find a way . and then we 'll get a chance to know if what i felt the first moment i saw you , and every minute since then , is real .
i do n't know if you can choose that , rafe .
evelyn ... you know the line -- let 's make tonight memorable . what i feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that . if i do n't come back , i do n't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you 'll carry the rest of your life .
i had to tell you in person . because there 's something else i need to say .
you waited til tonight to tell me ?
colonel doolittle pulled the strings , and put me on loan to the r.a.f . they need pilots , and we need experience . i leave tomorrow .
but you 're in the u.s. army , how could you --
i 'm going to the war . the real war . hitler 's taken europe . the brits are hanging on by their fingernails , and if they lose , there 'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine . and not just there , but here .
we 're all going away .
there 's one thing i have to say . i 'm going away .
it surprises me that i 'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way .
the only reason it 's hard to say is that i keep thinking i do n't have the right to say it . but i 've got to because it 's true . i love you . that must surprise you .
whatever you 're trying to tell me is n't good , is it . or it would n't be so hard to say .
i was hoping to meet him .
no , he ... got some news today . he 'll be okay , he just did n't feel like coming tonight .
danny 's not coming ?
nice to meet you , betty .
oh , this is betty .
you too , lieutenant .
hello , lieutenant . good to see you .
and if we fail , and lose our carriers , we destroy our ability to fight them at all . as soon as the second wave returns , we will withdraw .
if we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots , we destroy their ability to operate in the pacific for at least a year !
the second wave has not returned . and we have no idea where their carriers are . what is the damage report ?
we have achieved complete surprise ! the first wave is returning , the second is attacking now , and we have lost only a few planes . we can launch a third wave , admiral .
we must go ahead . this is our moment .
we have a fighter screen up , in case we are attacked , admiral .
we have achieved surprise , but their carriers are not in port . i do n't like this .
a brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war .
brilliant , admiral .
set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the americans will intercept , concerning every potential american target in the pacific . include hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way .
if we achieve surprise , they will offer little resistance .
everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us .
i have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission .
uncharged torpedoes have different balance .
god help them .
the chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the jap patrols do , if any of the planes make it .
so those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel .
there 've been some complications , sir . the chinese did n't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set . and the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway .
have the planes made it to china ?
we have bombed tokyo , mr. president . radio tokyo interrupted it 's own broadcast to make the announcement .
we 've done studies . we 're confident we would turn them back eventually ... after they 'd gotten as far as chicago .
what if the japanese did invade ?
crank her !
i have'na been able ta --
fook ya dooble !
learn english , then !
fook ya !
and if you do n't give me a plane that can handle combat , you better start learning to speak german .
if ye 'd wanted a bloody cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody states !
all of 'em .
well which of those three ya want fixed ?
the struts are loose , the hydraulics are leaking , and the electrical system 's shorting out in the cockpit .
leapin ' jesus !
the americans themselves have made it possible . we will annihilate them in a single attack -- at pearl harbor .
you see us as capable of such a blow ?
the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans . no matter how great our resolve , they have resources beyond ours . if we must go to war , there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover . in that time we can conquer all of the pacific , and they will have no choice but to ask for peace .
you have something to say , yamamoto ?
the time has come to strike ! or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future . i know what you whisper to the others , yamamoto -- that the americans are strong . yet look at their leader .
if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese .
so you join us , admiral . some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans .
it 's her 18th birthday , i want to show her off .
what 's peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting ?
i 've been trying to drag it out of her for years . you know , dreams are fascinating business . 'specially where you see the future .
i 'm not telling .
what 's it going to be , elizabeth ? seventyfive ? eighty ?
i 've already got some in . i was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight . how would you like that ?
quite a bit more rain than usual this year . i hope it does n't spoil the rhubarb .
peggy sue !
hello , lilla !
it would n't be a lodge without hats .
do you have to wear that hat ?
the last one was six hundred years ago . it 's about time for another one .
i hope so . at least i got to see you and grandma . has it ever worked before ?
i may be an old fool , but i think we can help you .
stag movies . smokers .
what does grandma think you do at your meetings ?
goodbye , grandma .
let 's go .
i 'd take better care of my teeth .
grandpa , if you had a chance to do it all again , what would you do ?
it 's your grandma 's strudel that 's kept this family together .
that never changes . you know , when you and grandma are gone , the family 's gone . i never see the cousins anymore .
it 's gon na rain again . every time i wash the car , it rains .
i remember that book ! grandpa , grandma , i want to tell you something .
well , i like to speculate . this book i 'm reading right now , a woman in colorado says she lived in ireland a hundred and fifty years ago . her name was bridey murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived . she was hypnotized . big bestseller .
do you believe in all of that ?
i do n't know . reunions do funny things to people .
why are you so nervous ? what is the matter with you today ?
i feel ridiculous . maybe i should go home and change .
not from the guy with the lowest prices in town .
mom , lots of people are separated and divorced .
borrow ? ! this was my dress . maybe it 's a mistake . what if i 'm the only one ? i do n't even want to go . everybody 's just going to say ... hi.. where 's crazy charlie ?
hey , you 're a hip chick . you look like you stepped right out of life magazine . any time you want to borrow it again , just ask .
then we 'd both have a miserable time . what do you think ?
come on mom . give him a break . he 's missing the reunion because of you . you know he wants to go .
but i want you and scott to understand . do you think he loves janet ? maybe he 's smashed too many fortune cookies .
it looks great . do n't change the subject . you know how busy saturdays are . and i ca n't do the icing . i always mess up the roses . you 're not being very responsible .
how do you like my hair ?
r was worried about you you did n't even call . you 're always on my case if i do n't call..
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her .
where were you ? you said you 'd be back at twelve .
look , carol , maybe walter 's done you a big favor . you always said you wanted to get out of town . go for it . and be happy , goddamnit , i 'm rooting for you .
what a i going to do for the rest of my life ? i do n't have a boyfriend anymore .
welcome to the singles ' scene .
after charlie told walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field , walter decided he should do the same thing .
what happened ?
it 's that jerk walter .
what 's the matter ?
are n't we a little old for that ?
okay . but let 's have a girls night soon . maybe a pajama party .
that loudmouthed little bitch~
i bet dolores told charlie .
come on . what 's with you and michael ?
you 're kidding ... ? carol , you have beautiful hair .
just what you underlined .
did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts ?
on what ?
all right . what 's the scoop ?
he does ?
yeah . you 're so lucky . he really loves you , too . he 's always telling walter how wonderful you are .
he is kind of cute , is n't he ?
that 's because you ' re not a total moron like they are .
i do n't get it .
yes . let 's stay in touch .
i 'll call you later .
that 's okay . i 'm sure i 'll remember the way .
we 're going to take you home .
maddy , what did you do to your hair ?
were taking you back to the nurse .
where is it ?
go on . you can do it .
i ca n't . it 's all too much .
they 're waiting . come on .
well , besides charlie , of course .
the only one ?
who knows . remember ... whatever walter wants ...
your first boyfriend . what do you think ? any sparks left ?
hi , peggy . god , that walter getz can still dance .
would n't we all .
oh , it 's not so bad . i have two wonderful kids , my own business . still , knowing what i know now , if i had the chance to do it all over again , i 'd sure do things a lot differently .
after you got knocked up , my mother did n't want me to talk to you . she thought it was contagious .
it 's not the place . i do n't buy that . trapped in the same town forever . the price she would pay for her teenage lust .
you should have left here years ago , like i did .
so he started having affairs , and you got depressed .
we did for a long time . we just got married too young , and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things .
you just have to remember ... men are like houses and trade upwards ... i thought you had a pretty good marriage .
i do n't know how you do it . i 've never even dated anybody but charlie .
welcome to the singles scene .
you 're probably the only one who could carry it off .
1 just did it for the reunion . i thought it would be fun .
peggy sue !
carol !
yeah . i 've got ta go . arthur 's picking me up soon .
do n't be silly . it 's saturday . date night !
you better watch out for her . she 's after charlie .
peggy sue !
) oh , maddy , grow up . it says in love without fear that `` the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it '' . page eightysix .
that 's disgusting !
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth .
maybe they 'll be the next dion and the belmonts .
charlie really has a great voice .
why do guys do such stupid things ?
can you believe i want to marry that dork .
michael fitzsimmons ! is he here ?
lucky lady . hi .
listen , i do n't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away . but i would do what i can ...
do n't try to charm me , charlie bodell .
i loved you since the day i met you , and i have n't stopped .
then hold me .
i 'll never give up .
you were terrific . and i kept trying to push you away but you would n't give up .
oh , god , dion .
charlie , i had a strange experience . i went back to high school . and i spent a lot of time with you . and you and walter and leon were singing `` i wonder why '' .
i 'll just set it right here .
it could n't be me . i hardly knew him .
that 's over . i got tired of translating everything . she thought the big hopper was a hamburger .
what about janet ?
i wanted to apologize . i ca n't live without you .
charlie , i thought i knew everything about you .
but happy . very happy , peggy sue .
you look awful , like you have n't slept in days . and so old .
i thought you were ... for a while .
charlie ? was i dead ?
. peggy sue , i love you , and i need you peggy sue ...
i 'm trying .
come back to me .
i 'll love you , too , charlie . i 'll love you for twenty years .
but i love you . i 'll love you forever .
i 've got to go now .
peggy ! where 're you going ? come back !
what the hell is that ?
do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed ?
i think we should get out of here . it 's going to rain .
i know .
i love you .
it opens , too . look inside .
oh , charlie .
of course .
will you take me back to my grandparents ?
i might be crazy , but i 'm not crazy enough to marry you twice . there 's a lot of things i ca n't change . i ca n't even think about them . i tried . but i could n't even help rosalie . i do n't want to be bitter . i 'm a naturally optimistic person . but you took advantage of that .
you 're crazy ! you 're really out of your mind !
you betrayed me , charlie . you were never there for me or the children . and now you come and tell me , `` peggy , you 're scared . '' of course i 'm scared . if you knew what i knew you 'd be scared shitless .
what ?
what do you mean you and my father decided ? who the hell are you to plan my life ? let 's get married and live happily ever after . bullshit . i got knocked up . i had to marry you . i never had a choice .
how could you possibly know what i 've been going through ?
look . i wan na tell you . i forgive you for everything . i know what you 've been going through . you 're just scared . i was scared , too , but i 'm not anymore .
right here . now sit down .
let me got ! where are you taking me ?
you 're going to listen to me .
do n't be ridiculous ! they 're just a bunch of harmless old men . my grandfather was in there .
i was trying to save you . they were going to vaporize you .
what the hell did you do that for ? what are you doing here ?
okay . listen , i cancelled the tickets for fabian . i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant , chez tres .
forget it , it 'll never work .
that 's all i wanted to hear . 'cause i 'm never going to give up on us . it 's easy to fall apart in a crisis . it 's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck . but this is more than love . this is a mental decision . just wait till tomorrow , when you see your birthday present . then you 'll understand .
it means i care about you and what happens to you .
does this mean you like me again ?
if you took the trouble to write it , then sure , i 'll take a look at it . but i 'm beginning to think that maybe there 's more to life than music . i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr. excitement ?
just take a look at it .
fat chance . you know , lee wilkins came to hear me last night . he told me to forget it . you told me to forget it . my parents tell me to forget it .
not exactly , but with your great voice , it 'll be a huge hit . honest .
you 're kidding . you wrote a song ? is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy ... she wants to hurt him , and he wonders why ?
stop being defensive . i want to help you . i wrote a song for you .
that 's real big of you .
i 'd forgotten how much music meant to you .
hey . i guess there 's a lot of things we do n't know about each other .
what were you doing there ? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group .
not terrific enough . what were you doing in that part of town ? who were you with ?
i was at lena 's last night . you were terrific .
how 'd you know about that ?
well , how about a walk , charlie bell..
sorry , the blue thunder 's out of commission for a while .
oh . i guess i always liked rusty better . could you give me a ride to school ?
rusty 's dead . that 's ajax
i wanted to talk to you , and i have one last thing to take care of at school . then i 'm going to ... good dog , rusty . good dog .
what 're you doing here ?
you do n't know zip ! you think i 'm going to end up selling appliances like my father ? chasing women around the store . i 've got to give it a shot . why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me ? until yesterday you loved me and you loved us . ) what the hell has changed ? for two years i 've done nothing but love you . i 'll show you , i 'm going to be just like fabian !
i 'm trying to save you years of frustration ... waiting for a big break ... no . waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me .
what ! what about the group and my singing career ? what about me ?
everything . i have a good head for business , i should be franchising the bakery . and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens , you 'll go to college . and finish .
but what has to be different ?
that 's just it . you can always get to me . there 's this window in my heart and every time i leave it open , you climb in . unless i close it now , nothing 's ever going to be different !
what about everything i said to you this afternoon ...
i just ca n't trust you anymore .
what are you talking about ? who 's janet ?
that wo n't make any difference . we just ca n't live together . and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet .
i will be happy if i have you . i love you .
charlie , . i 've been trying to postpone this . but what 's the point ? it 's over . i do n't want to hurt you . this is very hard for me . i 'm doing this for both of us . i really want you to be happy .
look , i 've got the hair , got the eyes , got the teeth , i got the car . i 'm the lead singer , i 'm the man .
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person , like napoleon ? how come it always turns into an argument with you ?
you 're going to blow it , peggy sue . nobody treats charlie bodell like this .
you know i never could stand your sarcasm .
then it 's true , dammit ! i had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you . when the monotones did `` book of love chapter four you break up , wo n't you give it just one more chance ... '' i 'm thinking did we break up ? 'cause if we did , i do n't even know about it ! . i thought we cleared all that up yesterday . did that maynard g. beatnik give you what you wanted ?
i bumped into him after you dropped me off last night . i did n't feel like going home , so we went for a ride .
i want to know what 's going on . dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons ...
let 's go down to the basement .
what are you doing here ?
i have to talk to you..
charlie . i just had the strangest dream .
do n't be cruel to a heart that 's true .
what am i going to do with you ?
because nothing else matters . that 's the great thing about love . every time we argue , every time something goes wrong , and i know that i 'm not perfect either , things just work out better in the end . cause you 're my baby and i love you .
why ?
yeah , i know . girls mature faster than guys . but last night , i was the one who put on the brakes . and you know why ?
but i 'm not . i 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand .
forget it . i 've been thinking . girls must go through that stuff too . sometimes when i look at you i feel like an animal . maybe my dad 's right . teenagers are nuts .
charlie . about last nights..
nothing.. selling is selling .
what do you know about classical music ?
save it .
i 'm sorry charlie .
you 're damn right ! jesus ! peggy ! you sure know how to spoil a mood .
this is a mistake . we better forget it .
you mean my wang ? listen , it 's running real late .
you know . your love machine ... the throbbing thrill hammer ... your thing !
who ?
i probably meant it when i said it . does n't lucky chuckie want to come out ?
but you 're the one who wanted to wait till we got married . and you were right . we should wait .
a lot 's happened since last weekend .
what ? ! you mean sex ? ! intercourse ? you want to have intercourse ! last weekend you said ... what time is it ?
charlie , let 's make love .
you know i do . i even wrote you into my will .
you really love me , do n't you ?
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight . and the tide rushes in .
mmm . this is nice . i always loved the way you kiss . i missed you .
yeah i know . but i do n't have to flatter you . it just feels right . you 're the perfect girl for me . as in is , was and always will be . i 'm glad dancing was invented . you know the first dances were rituals . like fertility rites .
you 're pretty charming when you want to be .
there is n't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
come on , let 's dance .
hey ! who needs physics when we 've got chemistry ?
he 's trying .
is he gon na help you with that physics stuff ?
charlie , what do you think of richard norvik ?
seriously . what 's it like to be eighteen ?
i 'm fine peggy sue . and how are you ? are we talking on the phone ? are we pen pals ?
charlie , how are you ?
is this slow enough for you ?
right . i promised my mother .
hey ! what 's the fun of being a teenager if you ca n't dress weird ? and we 're going to have fun tonight , right ?
it 's really fifties . you sort of clash with the world .
great , is n't it ?
where did you get that sweater ?
good .
yeah . like that .
rejected , worthless , miserable .
in the abstract maybe . get a grip on yourself ! but when i imagine you going out with other guys , i feel ... ah ...
i thought it had a lot of merit .
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch . i guess i deserved it . i 've been thinking about my three year plan and i think it 's unworkable . i must have been delirious .
thanks .
looking good out there .
would i ? ! ! why i oughta ...
would you ?
want me to drive you home later ?
they 'll learn to live with it .
well , we got the prom coming up , all these parties . we should n't upset our parents ?
why wait ?
it 's not going to be forever . i figure three years is long enough . i can see it the music pans out . and right after graduation we should start seeing other people . kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married . know what i mean ?
i can understand that.. but please do n't start crying again .
maybe i blocked it out .
how could you forget ? we talk about seeing other people and you forget ?
refresh my memory .
you know . about what we said on tuesday . it makes a lot of sense .
oh yeah ?
not that i 'm glad you were sick , but i had a chance to do some thinking last night .
i call this the staccato .
you drive like a maniac !
hey , i can take a hint . you look great today .
not now , charlie . i 've got a headache . get used to the word . roll it around your tongue for a years .
pretty strange .
how do you feel ?
no . you are the undead . you will live forever if you give me your twinkie . come on , let 's have it . you hate them anyway .
charlie ! am i dead ?
i vant to suck your blood . i also vant to suck your twinkie .
i 'm not going .
are you taking janet to the reunion tonight ?
i 'll think of a way to sell , them . one day .
i know . put scott through college .
you do n't want them ? they 're going to make a big comeback any minute . mark my words , these lamps are going to ...
i do n't buy them anymore . you were the only one who drank them .
you got a tab ?
jesus , peggy . take it easy . i 'm not used to that stuff . you always did the bills . blame the damn post office .
well , today 's saturday and it 's still not here .
i mailed it to you on wednesday .
i 'm still waiting for the mortgage check .
come off it , peggy . and what do you mean your house ? this is my house . i paid for it , i 'm still paying for it .
there 's something pathetic parked in front of my house .
and nothing will ever change that .
yeah . come on charlie , turn it off .
but you love me do n't you ?
i ca n't . i 'm too embarrassed .
come on peggy . say what we rehearsed .
... to record how much we love each other . sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world . and she would like to say something .
charlie ...
we 're here on the sofa bed ...
do n't say that ...
and we 're here on the couch ...
of course .
show her a good time , but for god 's sake restrain yourself .
what would that be , sir ?
we think this party might cheer her up . just make sure you know what 's expected of you .
yes , sir . trust is a twoway street . in the past two years i 've been pleased to note that you and mrs. kelcher have , uh , fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the , uh , woman i plan to take off your hands .
charles , in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music , we 've always regarded you a a fine young man . we 've trusted you with our daughter .
yes , sir . but that 's what i like about her . she 's not like all the other girls at school .
she seems confused , irresponsible , overemotional . my wife says that 's the way girls act sometimes .
yes , sir .
fine , thanks . come on in . i want to talk to you .
hello , sir . how are things at the hat store ?
hello , charlie .
have a nice day .
take a long walk on a short pier .
i beg your pardon ?
oh ! you did that on purpose ! i hate you . go gargle with razor blades !
sorry . these fountain pens are so tricky .
touchy , touchy !
are you for real ?
dolores , ca n't you be a little kinder to people ? you do n't even know the boy . if you were n't so neurotic and insecure , maybe you 'd shut up for a while and show some compassion .
god , peggy , you 're so unformed you 're practically fetal . you 're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends .
first of all , richard is not a creep . he happens to be an exceptional person . if any of you gave him half a chance , you 'd find that out .
carol and i saw you with that creep , richard , today .
test ?
did you study for the test ?
first a nerd and then a weirdo . what a bunch of nose pickers . i 'll tell charlie .
that commie beatnik ? what 's she doing with him ? wait 'll i tell charlie .
there 's peggy with michael fitzsimmons .
what , why ?
terry ! slow down .
okay .
terry , slow down .
what if we 're witnessing the end of touch dancing ?
hey terry , what is that ? did peggy make it up ? i 've never seen that on bandstand .
he wo n't tell me , but i 've got my suspicions . and i do n't want any of that . do n't keep her out late .
it was my idea , grandma . i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings .
my children make me happy . i miss them so much . beth . scott and beth . i 'm going to name my daughter after you .
right now you 're just browsing through time . choose the things you 'll be proud of . the things that last .
but i 'm remembering the future .
if you believe it , darling , then i believe . being young can be just as confusing as being old . the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday .
i 'm not afraid . i know exactly when i 'm going to die .
i wish she had n't .
you know , peggy sue , your mother said you had a dream that i died .
that 's a day 's work . but if that 's what you want , maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday .
fine . ) grandma , would you teach me how to make strudel ?
i 'm not going to marry him . i just went out with him once . i know ! why do n't we go to the movies tonight . just us girls . it 'll be fun .
but i always thought that you would marry charlie , carol would marry walter , and i would marry arthur . we 'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every sunday . it 'll spoil everything if you and charlie break up . that michael does n't look like the barbecue type .
cool it kids . he 's free to see other girls , if he wants .
he 's very interesting . for all his pretending to be a tough guy , he 's really got the soul of a poet .
yeah . he 's so cool and mysterious .
she 's unbelievable . who needs satellites when we 've got dolores 's mouth ?
how come we 're your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores ?
come on , where 's your enthusiasm ?
do n't get your hopes up .
it must run in the family .
beth 's boyfriend is playing in the band .
i wish i had the nerve . and the figure .
it was beth 's idea .
my father . he 's not just the ultimate square . he 's a total crook .
what ?
i can dig you being uptight about rita and utah . that 's cool . but i 've got to warn you about something .
can we split now ?
i thought i knew everything about him .
peggy sue 's still stuck on treble without a cause .
ssh . he 's great .
what a treat .
it 's charlie !
i can dig that . bittersweet perfection . dogs of lust on leashes of memory ... yeah .
yes . we had a glorious night together . one day you 'll remember and write about it .
you think so ?
that 's a terrific line . you 're going to be a wonderful writer .
but we had heat baby . passion ! fire ! we owe it to ourselves to fuse together . at least one more time .
michael , you and i are light years apart . you should go , but not with me .
but what about the other night ? we were like two stars in the same constellation .
i hate chickens .
why not ? polygamy 's legal in utah .
i ca n't do that .
rita . i met her last summer . she 's cool . you 'll really dig her . she 's got this great little cabin in the hills , just outside of provo where she raises chickens . i 'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us .
utah ? i thought you 'd be going to new york or paris . what 's in utah ?
now listen , this is the plan . as soon as school is finished we go to utah and ...
for everyone .
five more weeks of school . and ten minutes past graduation i 'm gone . to freedom .
i should n't have put you through that . it must have been agony . let 's do something .
that was quite an evening . bourgeois , phony , decadent , stupid .
okay . here 's a new one . it 's called tenderness . i could n't sleep so i thought i 'd scream betrayed by a kiss , sucking pods of bitterness . in the madhouse of dr. dread razor shreds of rat puke fall on my bare arms i 'm sorry . i guess i was trying to impress you .
i 'd love to .
no , i just made that up . do you want to hear one ?
is that one of your poems ?
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude . falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh . you 'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire .
i already did that . i want to be a dancer , i want to dance .
hey what 's with you ? i thought you were cool . you rode my bike . you blew some pot . what 's your scene miss majorette ? you gon na marry mr. blue impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life ?
they care about you . they 're just a different generation .
the only thing my father digs is cold , green money . all my mother cares about is her standing at the country club .
do n't you get along with your parents ?
maximum intensity . yeah . i ca n't wait to get out of here . i 'm gon na write . i 'm gon na check out of this bourgeois motel . push myself away from the dinner table and say 'no more jello for me , mom . '
what are you shooting for ?
the world is fantastic . it 's the ultimate absurd circus . i am shot from a cannon into the energy .
yeah . i 'm surprised . it 's really old ... travels well though . you know , the world looks a lot better from up here .
this is great reefer .
hey , man , i 'm a hip chick .
i thought chicks like you traveled in packs .
coffee and a donut .
what 're you doing here anyway ?
the young man leaned back in his chair . no bulls would die today .
a writer 's life is his work . jack kerouac does n't have to kill a bull to have something to write about . he 's out there feeling , burning ... grooving on life !
maybe you 're confusing his life with his work .
he 's a fisherman ! the most overrated writer of the century . i mean , he 's the perfect american author fat , violent , drunk ...
you do n't ?
gilfond 's okay , except he thinks hemingway 's great literature .
i was impressed with what you said in english class today .
look young lady , i grew up through the depression . i fought in the second world war . six days a week i get up and deal with the public , the bank and the bill collectors . and on the seventh day , when god rests , i do n't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool !
oh , you 're both so naive .
did n't call , them pantyhose , though . what was it , evelyn ?
oh no !
it 's the darndest thing . ed knew what they were immediately . as a matter of fact , he said he 's got a product like that in development right now .
how did it go with the pantyhose ?
wrong , dad . your idea .
you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea ?
you need a partner . there 's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars , mr. fitzsimmons . i 've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night .
that 's all well and good , but we do n't have the money to manufacture them .
this is your great invention ? would you wear those things ?
ta da ! pantyhose ! the death of the garter belt ! of course , once they 're manufactured they 'll look better than this . what do you think ?
richard nixon 's going to be president . nixon wears hats .
he 'll win .
kennedy 's a catholic . he 'll never win .
but when john f. kennedy 's elected president , men'1l stop wearing hats .
that 's very thoughtful , honey . it 's just a slump . things will pick up .
yes .
i , that what all that nonsense was about this morning ? you 're worried about my business ?
the hat business is in trouble .
this morning was good .
quiet today ?
it 's hard to believe you 're going to be eighteen . want an eskimo pie ? or a creamsicle ? i 'd come home from the store and there 's little you running up to me . i 'd give you a dime and you 'd promise never to grow up .
i wanted to apologize for this morning .
good , you got your money out of that greedy bank .
i closed my christmas club .
open it .
for me ?
doing some shopping ?
hi , dad .
evelyn , take her to her room !
listen dad , please . buy ibm , buy polaroid , buy apple computer . no , no . not yet . buy xerox !
i 've heard just about enough of this lunacy ! go to your room !
oh boy , that 's another thing that 's going to change . who 's going to think for us ? our husbands ? you know , you treat mom like a maid . it 's not entirely your fault . those were the attitudes in the fifties , and that 's the way you raised me . but give nancy a break , encourage her to go to art school .
that 's your problems the more women think , the more trouble they get into .
i think they 're going to deregulate it .
do you know how ridiculous you sound ? first of all , it 's illegal for u.s. citizens to buy gold . and in the second place , the price of gold is regulated by the government .
i want to help with the family finances . i want you to buy some stocks . and gold . by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce . then you sell .
all right . but this better be good .
calm down . just listen for a minute.. please .
yes but i was a boy . and i still had hell to pay .
dad.. it 's not a big deal . did n't you ever stay out all night when you were young ?
thank god for that .
at my age ? do n't be silly .
peggy , let me ask you something . you 're not ... expecting are you ?
it 's not charlie . it 's me .
damn that charlie i
i think i 'm way ahead of them .
if all the kids jumped off a bridge , would you do that too ?
mom , is there any coffee left ?
you 're so young , this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits .
that would be impossible .
thank you.. i accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again .
evelyn , put her to bed .
dad , i never knew you had a sense of humor .
grounded ? ha ! the story of my life . i do n't wan na go to my room . i wan na import japanese cars . i wan na go to liverpool and discover the beatles .
i do n't see the humor in this . go to your room immediately . you 're grounded .
just a little . i 've had a tough day .
young lady , you 're drunk !
mr. fitzsimmons is a very prominent man .
peggy sue , watch your mouth .
we 'll make it , we 'll be fine .
jack , i was just trying to help .
i want everybody to hear because i do n't have anything to be ashamed of .
does everybody have to hear ?
please do n't shout .
i do n't need your charity . i do n't need your grandmother 's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that ?
you have four seasons , you have four slumps .
do n't worry , it 's just a seasonal slump .
a new car . we ca n't afford a new car .
this is not giving blood . this is drunk .
jack , take it easy . she gave blood at school today . maybe she 's just a little lightheaded .
he 's a liar ! he has no such thing ! it 's my own fault . i should have had it patented first . he 's a crook , damnit .
sheerotards . catchy name , is n't it ? like leotards .
yeah , i know peggy sue gets married . case closed . period . mom , if you could live your life over again , would you do the same thing ? get married and settle down after high school ?
what ? when did it happen ? your dad and i always expected you two to get married .
you know mom , it 's okay to have male friends . besides , it 's over with me and charlie .
what does charlie think about that ?
no , just a friend of mine . i do n't think he likes jello .
mom , how about a machine that 's like your blender , only it slices vegetables , kneads dough , chops meat and even make fresh pasta ?
you know , dear , i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea , but the next time you come up with something , please do n't stay out all night . just tell us . we 'll believe you .
we 've got to move fast . this is an idea whose time has come .
is n't that awfully forward ?
instead of a girdle . and light as a feather .
would they go over my girdle or under ?
way to go , mom !
i 'm not the maid !
i went for a drive . up in the hills .
where have you been ?
you accepted an invitation , maddy 's one of your best friends , and i baked the rice krispie squares .
i do n't feel very festive .
maddy 's party .
for what ?
charlie 's downstairs . why are n't you ready ?
peggy , do you know what a penis is ? stay away from it .
what do you mean ?
is charlie pressuring you to do things you do n't think you should be doing ?
i 'm confused about a lot of things right now . charlie 's only one of them .
that 's a good girl ... i hate to see you so upset . tell me , sweetheart . are you having problems with charlie ? you mentioned something this morning .
i 'm sorry , mom . i 'll call grandma back and apologize .
yes , he 's fine , too . you saw them at easter .
she did ? i love her so much , and i have n't seen her in such a long time . and grandpa barney . is he all , right ?
well , she is getting on , but she 's fine . i told her you were n't feeling well yesterday . she called to find out how you are .
i had a dream that grandma died .
what happened to you ?
it 's grandma . i ca n't talk to her now . i 'm sorry , grandma .
peggy ! what 's the matter ? who is it ?
sure , mom . hello .
would you get that , dear ?
it was great to see everybody again . but it 's so boring and regimented . most of what they teach is useless . the worst thing was lunch .
it was nobody . ah ... he 's a poll , taker . i 'm thinking of voting democrat this year . but do n't mention it to your father . how was school today ?
who was that man ?
the house payments .
what about ?
sort of .
what 's the matter ? did you two have a fight ? .
oh yeah . charlie . how am i going to handle him ?
oh . ah ... recently . all the kids drink it .
when did you start drinking coffee ?
i 'm still here , are n't i ? i may as well enjoy myself . i 'm going to go to school today . dad , i want to apologize for yesterday . the car is a classic . use it in the best of health .
you 're looking pretty chipper this morning .
oh . i forgot .
what happened to your hair ? you have such a pretty face . why are you always trying to cover it up ?
oh mom , i forgot you were ever so young .
my little baby . do n't try to grow up so fast .
i 'm home now .
of course , dear . you 're home now .
chanel number five . that always reminds me of home .
mom !
why do n't you go lie down for a while .
i 'm excused .
how do you feel ?
i have a note .
the nurse called and said you 'd be coming home .
mom !
of course , he 'll love it . you 're a terrific artist .
you think this 'll cheer dad up ?
can i tell diane that peggy sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret ? well ?
mom , sit down for a minute . this is so nice , all of us being together again like this .
you know , you two are wonderful parents . i 'm really going to try to behave myself .
and the butter .
they 're bad for you . they cause ... red lips .
why not ? they 're my favorite .
do n't eat the red ones .
look at kenny rossi . is n't he dreamy ? i wish he 'd break up with arlene . she thinks she 's so great .
it 's unbelievable . the man never ages .
okay , what do you want ? what dumb favor do you want me to do ?
let 's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly ? or careers ... clue ... snakes and ladders ?
teenagers are weird . and you 're the weirdest .
i 'm sorry about that . i really want us to be closer . i have enough unresolved relationships in my ... life .
come on ! mom said you were sick . you 're never happy to see me .
i 'm just happy to see you .
what are you doing ?
you 're sick . you should go to the nurse . i 'm going to tell miss dennis .
rosalie , please , listen to me ! you have to stop .
not to me they do n't . i 'm going to win the state , then the . nationals , and then i 'm going to the olympics .
but accidents can happen .
i spend three hours a day practicing . i have trainers , i know what i 'm doing .
i know you are , but you have to stop . i could n't tell you before , i did n't know if i should . but you have to stop before you hurt yourself .
do n't be silly , i 'm the best in the county .
i think you should give up diving . it 's dangerous .
what 's up ?
you have an incredible memory .
i remember when you got that locket , too . you were so excited i think you showed it to the whole school .
rosalie testa !
i remember that dress .
you ca n't . you 're going to be valedictorian .
wait ! i 'll go with you !
no ! no ! no ! peggy sue got married ! case closed . i do n't want to marry anybody . goodbye richard .
okay . why do n't we do something visionary . change your destiny , peggy sue . change your destiny and marry me .
yeah , yeah . i 'm taking a big gamble . i 've loved him for a long , long time .
did you break up with charlie ?
vision ? i 'm a walking anachronism ! i 've upset my parents . i miss my kids . i could be trapped here forever ! and poor charlie ... i got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married . tomorrow 's my birthday ! i 've got to get out of here now .
so are you . you 've got a vision .
you were meant to you 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to .
goodbye ? where 're you going ? what about our partnership ? i 'm making real progress with the microchip .
i came to say goodbye .
you were meant to . you 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to . i have to get out of here .
not true . i think i 'm making real progress on the microchip .
it 's all , gone wrong , nothing 's working out .
what 's the matter ?
oh , go feel up your hamsters ! i hear rodents put out .
hey ! do you have any idea how much those beakers cost ? i usually charge for hypnosis .
god dammit ! how 'm i gon na got out of here ?
i think it has something to do with your birthday . you were rambling . i did n't understand the rest .
that 's just perfect is n't it ? did it work ? did you find out why i came back ?
me ? you went crazy ! you started taking your clothes off . i was putting them back on for you .
richard ! you should be ashamed of yourself .
one ... two ... three . you are now awake .
i could n't help it i loved him .
no ! yes ! i 'll be right out , dad . oh shit ! peggy , i 'm going to snap you out of it .
yes , every day . maybe i should n't have worn that dress ? i told beth it was a bad idea . that 's why they made me queen .
will you take of f your blouse ?
no . the pill will be for birth control . but girls do like sex . maybe not the first time .
you mean you 'll give a girl a pill and she 'll want to have sex ?
no . the pill will change all that . then he would n't have blamed me . we were just too young .
in the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
we were lying in the sand . it was my eighteenth birthday ... we were so awkward ... i would have married him anyway ...
silicon is from sand .
i think it 's called silicon . charlie told me that .
what will they be made of ?
ah ... .. they 're very tiny ... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set ...
oh boy . peggy , what are microchips ?
peggy sue kelcher . or , peggy bodell . i 'm not sure .
you are completely relaxed . when i count to three , you will open your eyes . one ... two ... three . we 'll start with something easy . what is your name ?
no offense , but you 're pretty out of it now .
look , i 'm desperate . i 'll try anything . but what if you ca n't snap me out of it ?
everything . this is perfect . the subconscious mind remembers all . you can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion . maybe that 'll give us a clue on how to get you back .
what do you know about hypnosis ?
suggestion ! hypnotic suggestion ! why did n't i think o~ that before ?
like what ?
look , the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case . may i make a suggestion ?
for god 's sake , forget the money ! i 'm going crazy ! i 'm a walking anachronism . i 'm a puddle of deja i 'm worried about my kids , scott must be scared to death , i think my daughter 's doing drugs again . i ca n't have any fun here , i do n't have that innocence any more . i ca n't keep all this in anymore . i feel like i 'm going to explode .
cheer up . now you can give some other guy a shot . make it up to him later and buy him a yacht .
it was an unfair fight . he did n't have a chance . i 'm taking a real gamble . i loved him for a long , long time .
that 's terrific . you did it . you really changed the course of your destiny .
yep . it 's going to be a law . i broke up with charlie last night .
that 's what you were talking about yesterday ? everybody does that in the future ?
jogging . i was running , now i 'm jogging .
what are you doing ?
hi , richard .
high tech . i like the sound of that .
the wave of the future ! i 've decided on our first fortune ! i 'll see you later . you just think high tech .
what are you talking about ?
richard ! they do n't have any ! they never heard of them ! is n't that wonderful ?
oh . and huge portable radios . everything else gets small , but for some reason , portable radios get enormous .
all right . these are the choices : microwave ovens , pocket calculators , walkmans , digital watches and miniature tv 's .
you do n't have to use pig latin ! nobody could possibly know what we 're talking about .
not for you . okay , there 's lots more .
are you talking ~about exercise ? like gym ?
there are major fortunes to be made here . leisure time and lifestyles .
come on . you ca n't be serious .
ah . this is a biggie . forget sneakers . running shoes , jogging shoes , tennis shoes . fifty to two hundred dollars a pair .
when do we start ?
you 're taking advantage of a minor .
sixtyforty .
look it 's very simple . you tell me everything that has n't been invented yet , and i 'll invent it . we 'll be partners . fiftyfifty .
wbat 're you talking about ?
good . you 're discreet . i like that in a partner .
give me some credit , will you ?
i 'm curious , but i do n't want to know . jeez , i hope you have n't been telling people what 's going to happen to them .
how come you never ask me any important questions ? do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? or a cure for cancer ? what about your family ? what about people ?
no offense , but for a person who says she 's lived an extra lifetime , you certainly are thick . money is power.. money makes people respect you ...
richard , take it easy .
i 'm talking about invention , no investment . i know what people think of me . mr. spasmatician . dick the square root . i 'll show them . you said i was going to be a millionaire . and you 're gon na help !
i tried to tell them , but they would n't listen to me .
but you have a vision . do n't you want to help your parents ?
i 'm just not the type . besides , i want to get out of here .
the way i see it , you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world .
what if you 're not here tomorrow ?
i 'm trying . i 'll see you tomorrow .
all right , i 'll work on it , i 'll , do some research . but in the meantime , do n't get crazy .
i told you , i 've already lived my life . i do n't know how or why i 'm here , but you have to help me get back . i want to get back to my real life !
you 're a molecule in chaos , a discontinuent aberration . maybe you 've just got powers of precognition . well , maybe you 're just out of whack .
what if it 's beyond science ? what it it 's god ?
okay , you 're not dead , but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible .
confucious says , the way out is through the door . there 's a truck . there 's your door .
what 're you doing ?
there 's one way to find out .
am i dead or not ?
you 're giving me the creeps .
come on , richard , i 'm serious .
you look pretty good for a corpse .
that 's why i was getting a divorce.. what i really think is that i had a heart attack at the reunion and died .
i 'd be very careful if i were you . you don ' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain .
i do n't know .
but when did you leave ? are you here until then ? were you there until now ? what direction are you going in ? are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past ? can anyone do it ?
holy toledo ! that 's six years ahead of schedule !
because i 'm telling you the truth . i know what 's going to happen . there 's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants . and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon . on july 20 , 1969 .
how , did you know about my grandfather ?
you have a blind grandfather . one day you 're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people . i read about it . you 're going to be famous . you 're going to invent a lot of things .
you probably are crazy . wait a minute . is this some kind of joke ? i know what you all , think of me .
this is serious . nobody can know . ah , i 've returned from the future . i traveled back here 25 years .
okay . i promise .
listen , you 've got ta keep this a secret . you ca n't tell a soul . promise ?
absolutely . people , dogs , elephants .
so you think time travel is possible ? for people ?
you can till it with whatever you want . from illusions to memory , from experience to innocence , from happiness to the entire universes
what 's inside ?
well , i think time is like a burrito . sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other .
i know what a burrito is .
that 's my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito . i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland .
what 's that ?
and then , there 's richard 's burrito .
well ... in a newtonian framework , the possibilities were limited , but with the advent of relativity theory , the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed .
sort of .
are you doing some kind of science project ?
i want to ask you a question . do you think ... time travel is possible ?
i 'm writing a book on kite construction . what did you want to talk about ?
what a great kite .
all right . i 'll be in the physics lab . make it fourthirty . i have a rocket club meeting .
it 's not that . can we meet after school ? please ?
i 'm not doing any tutoring this year . i 'm too busy .
i have to talk to you . it 's very important .
it really was n't that difficult .
congratulations on the math contest , richard .
you know , i never told anybody this , but i always had a feeling that when you die , before you go to heaven , you get a chance to fly around high school for a while .
i guess part of us never really leaves high school .
you 're a sweet man , richard .
dancing with you .
what was ?
you were always friendly to me . i appreciated that . you know , this used to be a fantasy of mine .
well , you showed them . you 're rich and famous and successful . and you have a beautiful wife .
the only time people like dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me . that guy , doug snell , who shook my hand when we walked in , he used to call me a foureyed worm .
gee . i 'm sorry to hear that .
he 's not here . we 're getting divorced .
where 's charlie ? i was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials . really made me laugh .
hello . nice to meet you . please call me peggy . i 'm peggy bodell now .
i just did it for tonight . i do n't normally dress like this .
you look exactly the same .
i was once . richard ! ? richard norvik ? i did n't recognize you .
are you peggy sue kelcher ?
my god ... ... how is that possible ? you have to help me , doctor yolander . i do n't know what i 'm dealing with here ! they 've dug up my wife ...
believe what you saw , matthews . the dog was dead .
well ... uh ... thanks ...
you want some advice , friend ? you get in your car , you pick up your family ... and you get the hell out of that town .
exactly ! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition ... immune deficiency or ...
the creed cat , that 's right . bastard 's name was `` church '' . let me guess . your dog 's tissue is n't healing , pupils are n't dilating ... maybe you ca n't find a heartbeat ?
... the pathologist ... he said that you had reported a similar incident ... with a cat ...
i ... um ...
why are you bothering me about this ? ca n't you leave it be ?
god damn it gus , you dug up my wife ! what the fuck is going on around here ? !
i was building a doggy door .
how 'd you know that ?
i hear you 've got marjorie hargrove working for you now .
-- drew , he 's your dog . are you listening to this ?
thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly . i 'll give you som antibiotic cream --
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes .
when i was young i thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys .
i suppose so .
that 's renee alright .
i wanted to get geoff out of l.a. just start things over , you know ?
i hear you moved into town .
pretty much so .
did she always have reporters following her around like this ?
because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander ...
yes ... why ?
you took over for doctor yolander ?
not this dog . there was n't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea .
wait , there must be some mix-up . he was ... the dog is alive .
i do n't know what you expected to find , matthews . there 's nothing wrong with the antigens , nothing to indicate an unusual death ...
what ?
he does n't . i do n't know what he has , but i 'm hoping to god it 's not infectious ...
i hope he does n't have rabies .
you sure did ...
i had a little run-in with zowie .
what happened to you ?
oh , you know ... drink beer , tell ghost stories . they try and spook each other out , talking about zombies and things ... it 's no big deal , chase . i did it when i was young .
what do they do up there ?
he 's probably going up to the pet sematary . kids 've been going out there on halloween night for years .
out ?
well we 're glad to have you , marjorie . you can call me chase , by the way .
i 'm real excited about working for you mr. matthews ...
uh ... no . you just ... look different than you sounded on the phone . please , come in .
is something wrong ?
anywhere but here .
so where 're we going ?
all set .
all set ?
he did . we buried him . there 's a place out in the woods ... if you bury something there , it comes back alive .
geoff , this is crazy . zowie did n't die .
i can bring her back . the same way drew and me brought zowie back ...
what are you talking about ?
i 'm not hungry .
geoff , dinner 's ready ! geoff ? !
i 'm really tired , dad ... can i just go to sleep ?
`` out . '' well that 's great , geoff . look , i 've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks , but i 'm not going to stand for crap like this . i do n't care if it 's halloween ... it 's a school night , and if you do this again ...
just out .
i 'm going out , dad !
hey ! where 're you off to ?
remember zowie , drew 's dog ? he got hurt again . i 'm going over to take a look at him .
who was that ?
i still ca n't believe she 's dead ...
your mom and i loved each other , geoff . do n't ever think that we did n't .
i think so .
you alright ?
what ?
it sucked .
hey ! how was your first day at school ?
i 'll be fine , dad .
you nervous ? new town , new school . i know it must be pretty hard for you ...
sure .
what 's a lunch cost these days ? you want ten ?
nothing . i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs .
what 's wrong ? !
it 's been a few years .
how long ago did this guy retire ?
say your goodbyes . zowie 's going outside . you 're grounded , buddy . that 's the new law .
zowie ...
i 'm not trying to prove anything . i was burying my dog .
your momma 's worried sick over you . you take off in the middle of the night , you do n't show up for school . what 're you trying to prove ?
hey , i 'm so sorry i 'm not the stud that you are .
not that much appreciation . i thought we were gon na tone down that flabby ass .
just until he heals up ?
drew , i do n't remember inviting zowie in for dinner .
is he gon na be okay ?
damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him . i swear that dog 's an idiot .
all the time .
you ever think about running away ?
go later ...
i got ta go back and do my chores ...
dies ?
i do n't know ... ... maybe it depends on what you were like before you ...
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus ?
i do n't know but i 'm not taking any chances ...
what was that all about ? you think he 's trying to scare us ?
it 's like he 's not gus anymore . he 's different . you know , like zowie ...
what do you mean ?
it 's weird ...
maybe it takes a while ...
how can he not have a heartbeat ?
you think he 'd believe it if he did ?
you think my dad 'll figure out why he 's not getting better ?
he was dead . you know he was .
maybe he was n't dead when we buried him .
yeah ...
it 's getting pretty late . we better go .
you never get over it .
i 've never had anyone die before ... ... but i guess you get over it . i mean , eventually ...
you have to bury your own . that 's the way the indians did it . it 's like a rule ...
you want me to help ?
look , if there was even one chance in a million it 'd work , would n't you want to try ?
drew , i know your dog died , but ... get a grip , man , you 're freaking me out .
what if it 's not bullshit ? if i bury zowie there , and it works ... ... he 'll come back alive .
come on , that 's just a bullshit story . you said so yourself ...
the old indian burial ground .
what did ?
this is it ... i was n't sure if it even really existed .
there 's a better place ...
why not ?
i 'm not burying him here ...
is this a good spot ?
nothing . it 's just an old ghost story . let 's get out of here ...
what was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life ?
stepdad . gus is my stepdad .
you should n't ever say that about your parents , not even your dad .
i swear , sometimes i wish gus was dead ...
sorry about your mom . i could n't handle not having my mom around . just having gus ...
he pissed me off .
i 've never seen anybody punch clyde before .
zowie .
what 's his name ?
i came back for you , geoff . we 're going to be together again .
mom ...
you know everything , do n't you ?
i know , mom .
i miss him too ...
good . he said he 'd be over for dinner at eight ... i mean ... he misses you , mom ...
how did it go with your father last night ?
couple minutes . i saw the last shot . that was pretty cool .
how long have you been here ?
right here , mom ...
geoff ? anybody see my boy ?
yes , bob , i do . excuse me ? am i being fired ?
do you really think so , andy ?
maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it . we 'll try combinations of those letters ...
k-r-o-one .
what was the file name ?
sorry ...
allright . calm down .
what 's wrong with my face ? you want to know what 's wrong with my face ? i 've got a skin condition . next question , bob ? no more questions ? fine . now can you help me find the complaint ?
what 's wrong with your face ?
bob ...
what in god 's name ... ?
you 'll never find it in the dark .
i do n't know what to do , bob .
jesus .
you 'll have to get right on it , andy , we 're up against the statute of limitations .
yes !
bailey , brackman .
andy , do you know who reps kronos inc. ?
if macrosystems wins , an energetic , young company will be destroyed , five thousand americans will be out of work . moreover , the laws of copyright and anti-trust were enacted to prevent exactly the kind of bullshit macrosystems is trying to pull .
charles is right behind me .
in a word , bob ...
are we interrupting , andy ?
oh , you 're right , beckett , you do n't have an attitude problem .
excuse me , charles . with all due respect ... this is ... preposterous ! it does n't make any sense , it sounds as if we 're talking about someone else . pardon the lack of humility , but i 've had the distinct impression i was kind of ... one of the rising stars around here . and i feel that was n't just my imagination . and i also think i deserve to know what 's really going on here , charles .
really ? who thinks that , sir ?
some people think you have an attitude problem , beckett .
perhaps ... you 're right . i 've certainly been busy . with the kronos complaint , a preliminary injunction hearing and the saunders trial all falling at the same time ...
there wo n't be a next time , i guarantee it .
this time . what about next time ?
andy ?
you 're right , i probably just misfiled ...
whacked with a racquetball . i appreciate your faith in my abilities .
what 's that on your forehead , pal ?
thanks , walter .
because they deserve to , walter .
why , beckett ?
i hope you 're ready for `` studs , '' because that 's what 's on .
whatever .
ready for what , baby ?
i 'm ready ...
do you think i 'm ready for it ? ! i hate this shit . i 'm not a fucking martyr ! i hate every goddamn part of it !
i 'm not ready to die .
then , what < u > are < /u > we , drew ? ! the < u > winners < /u > ? `` ladies and gentlemen , the first prize of aids goes to andrew beckett and his lover miguel ... '' excuse me , i 'm not your lover . i 'm your care partner . fuck !
you want me to give up ? let this thing turn us into < u > victims < /u > ?
that 's right . we 're on the positive plan . you do n't have a fatal disease , you have manageable illness .
i 'm not going to die .
maybe you should think about it .
what 's that mean ? !
maybe you should think about it .
maybe i should start making plans , is that what you think ? start planning my memorial service ? `` begin to prepare for the inevitable . ''
no .
you 're scared . you think we 're near the end .
that 's not what i said .
you do n't think there 's much time left , do you ?
the least you can do is look at me , while i 'm sticking this shit into your arm . forget the fucking case , one hour a day , and give me a little of your time .
allright it 's closed ! jesus !
close the fucking law book !
i 'm not going to close the --
close the law book .
what 's wrong with you ?
that shit 's saving your life , you asshole !
fuck you . this shit 's probably not doing me any good anyway .
fuck you .
i said , skip it , michael . it 's my treatment .
we 're not skipping this treatment .
i have too much work to do . skip the treatment .
hold still . shit . the goddamn vein 's clotted . we have to go the goddamn hospital , so they can change the goddamn catheter .
yes . i think it will be a simple solution . they 'll put it in a syringe , inject it into your bloodstream . it 'll neutralize the virus . it 'll revitalize the immune system , and people with aids will become healthy again .
you got that right , mikey ... you still believe that , do n't you ?
i said , `` everyone 's going to die , jimmy . but drew 's not going to die of aids . there 's a cure around the corner , and he plans to be around to take advantage of it . ''
jerk ... what did you say ?
i promise !
drew !
one hour !
you 're leaving the hospital ? you 're going into the office looking like that ? are you insane ?
you 're not smiling .
you 're going to the office ? !
thanks for leaving school , and coming here , and ... i will be back . an hour , tops .
you 're not going to like this . please try to smile ...
why are you getting dressed ?
i am relaxed .
that 's the third time . i better call the office . would you relax , please ?
he 's not sorry , okay , fine . why do n't we see what we find out from the blood work ? i 'll work on getting a specimen , i 'm sure hospital food could help in that direction . maybe , by then , we 'll hear from my doctor , and we 'll go from there . okay ? everybody happy ?
do n't apologize for me .
a reaction to azt ...
it could be parasites , an infection ...
so what ? it 's nothing to be ashamed of . you have nothing to be ashamed of , okay ?
i almost did n't make it to the bathroom , miguel . i almost lost control right in front of everybody .
i said , do n't worry about it .
are n't you giving an exam ?
yeah . thanks , guys .
thanks , you guys .
i 'm seeing him this afternoon .
longstreet 's interested in the harrisburg deal .
do n't do this , andy .
you can save it for the jury , charles . i want to hear you say , under oath , in front of a judge and a jury , i 'm a bad lawyer . gentlemen . counselor .
a carrot ? !
i hoped the challenge would improve your performance . you could say it was a carrot .
if you 'd lost confidence in me , why did you give me the kronos suit ?
take it easy , walter .
honesty is always best .
we 've been talking it over , andy . your future that is ... we feel that , because we respect you so much , we have to be honest with you .
more than your friend . family .
i know that , charles .
of course .
thanks for coming in .
no sweat , buddy .
thanks , charles .
bearing in mind that bill wright , the chairman of macrosystems , is a close , personal friend of mine ... which side of this mess would < u > you < /u > desire to be on , andy ? and do n't allow my very tight , personal relationship with bill to influence your answer in any way .
it is , and it is n't , charles . macrosystem 's new software copies all the best-known elements of kronos ' spreadsheet program . if they 're allowed to sell it , kronos will get undersold right out of business . for me , the legal principle , involved is copyright infringement .
he 's upset , he 's sorry .
i 'm trying to help your `` partner . '' you 're not a member of his immediate family , i could have you removed from the er .
dr. klenstein . it 's not a pleasant procedure , but if the ks is causing the diarrhea , we ought to know right away .
this is my partner . we keep records of hospital visits . nothing personal .
sounds delightful .
... meanwhile , i 'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy , so we can take a look inside .
we 're waiting ...
about my blood work ?
mr. beckett , i 'm sorry ...
you bet . we 'll see you later .
thanks for coming by .
sure thing .
i better get home . lisa and i are having some friends over .
it was good working with you , andrew . you 're welcome . hey . should n't you put that thing back on ?
excellent work , joe . i thank you .
a good start .
what ?
what do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean ?
thank you .
yes .
can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror ?
if it please the court , i 'd like to ask mr. beckett to remove his shirt , so that the jury can have an < u > accurate < /u > idea of what we 're talking about .
yes . on my torso .
do you have any lesions on < u > any < /u > part of your body , at this time , that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired ?
well ... many things . but i think the thing i love the most , is that every once in a while , not that often , but occasionally ... you get to be part of justice being done . it 's really quite a thrill when that happens .
what do you love about it ?
i love the law . i know the law . i excel at practicing it . it 's the only thing i 've ever wanted to do .
what makes you an excellent lawyer ?
i 'm an excellent lawyer .
are you a good lawyer ?
you do n't bring your personal life into a law firm . you 're not supposed to < u > have < /u > a personal life , really . anyway , i did plan to tell charles , eventually . but then , this thing happened at the tennis club ...
can you explain < u > why < /u > you did n't ?
no . i did n't .
in the years you worked at wyant wheeler , did you ever tell charles wheeler you were gay ?
i still am .
except ... you were gay ?
i suppose you could say that .
a regular all-american guy ?
you did n't look then , the way you look now ?
it 's possible i was infected with the hiv virus at that time , but i was n't diagnosed until several years later .
obviously , at this time , you were n't sick .
possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law . a razor sharp litigator , a genuine leader , gifted at bringing out the very best in others . an awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues , courtrooms , the person on the street . the kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but does n't sweat . but underneath the elegant surface , was an adventurous spirit .
what kind of person is that ?
he was ... the kind of person i thought i wanted to be .
what impressed you about him ?
particularly , charles .
you 're ready , do n't worry .
i 'll look over the q and a .
opera ?
want to hear my favorite aria ?
opera ?
thanks . do you like opera ?
i know a good probate lawyer .
i 've made provisions in my will for some charities . miguel will need a lawyer . i know it 's not your area ...
we proceed , representing your estate .
what happens ?
i 've considered that .
there 's a possibility i wo n't be around for the end of this trial .
for a healthy baby . for lisa to make it through the delivery . for the phillies to get into the playoffs .
what have you prayed for ?
then we establish how wheeler 's boys recruited you after law school ...
do you ... pray ?
what ?
charles . okay . miller ?
beckett ?
uh huh ...
when you refer to wheeler , call him charles , to show how you 'd been admitted to the inner circle , you were considered one of them .
let 's review these notes for your testimony . we have a big day on monday .
thank you for sharing that with me , joe .
let me tell you something , okay ? when you 're brought up , like the rest of us , in a place like where i was brought up , there 's not a whole lot of discussion about ... homosexuals . as a kid , you 're taught right away that queers are weird , queers are funny , they 're a danger to kids , they 're afraid to fight , and they all want to cop your joint . and that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there , if you want to know the truth .
you survived your first gay party intact .
you 're right .
correct .
you think i 'm uncomfortable ...
thank you .
no , we have to do it . but later , allright ?
sure . it 's fine .
excuse me , i 'm having a goddamn party , is that allright with you ?
beer . we need to go over your q and a .
what do you want ?
let 's find you a drink .
get it ?
not bad .
i 'm a law suit .
i had a blood transfusion today . i feel great .
beckett . you seem ... better . energized , more alive ...
it 's me , you dork .
we 're friends of beckett 's .
parrtyy !
any settlement agreement < u > must < /u > include , and this is critical , a letter of exoneration , making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work .
one more thing , your honor ...
arline ?
arline decision . supreme court .
there is no relevant precedent .
thank you .
so kenton connected the ... lesion , < u > and < /u > whatever suspicions he had about your personal life ... to this woman , maria ... and blew the whistle on you . suddenly you 're losing files , and it 's time to let you go . but , up to this point , you 've been their golden boy , their rising star ... their behavior is ... inconsistent .
no . they did n't fire her .
they did n't fire her ?
the partner who spotted the lesion , walter kenton , used to work for benton , myers , in d.c. there 's a paralegal there , maria torres . she 's had lesions on and off for three years . she says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by aids .
one of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead .
how did they find out ?
rayisha . very nice .
rayisha .
what 's her name ?
huh ? oh . great . she 's great .
i 'm a lawyer . how 's your baby ?
find a lawyer ?
what ?
who 'd you get ?
fine .
oh , beckett . how 's it goin ' ?
do n't send flowers , joe . i 'm not dead yet .
beckett ? i 'm sorry about ... what 's happened to you . it 's a fucking kick in the head .
thanks for your time .
correct . i do n't .
look . i know i have a case . if you do n't want to take it for personal reasons ...
i knew you were going to say that . i do n't buy it , and i do n't see a case .
they sabotaged me .
okay ... they want you out . it 's against the law to fire you for having aids , so they make you look like a fuck up . which leads us to the mysterious , lost file .
joe , from the day i arrived to the day they fired me , i performed consistently , thoroughly and with absolute excellence . and if they had n't fired me , that 's what i 'd be doing today .
okay , okay ... they discover you have this horrible , disgusting , terminal illness , and they panic , for any number of perfectly valid reasons . they 're frightened for themselves , their families ... maybe it 's the homo angle . maybe they do n't want to rub elbows with someone who 's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne . and how do they explain your status to the client for chrissake ?
the law says people with disabilities can not be terminated , so long as they can perform the duties required by their position ...
as in , the vegetable ?
i buy that .
charles , i must apologize again , for the kronos mishap . it was a scary few minutes around here . wow . but thank god , the complaint was found . and no damage was done .
big trouble .
makeup .
hell , they are staring . what 's that shit on your face ?
i dove back into work , everything was fine . until the lesions started ...
continue .
miguel alvarez . we 've lived together for nine years .
your ... lover ?
my lover and i .
we ?
i was diagnosed with aids eight months ago . during a bout of pneumonia . i recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days . since i was doing so well on the azt , we decided against telling anyone about it .
continue .
nine .
how many lawyers did you go to , before you called me ?
i misplaced an important complaint . that 's their story . want to hear mine ?
continue .
correct . i 'm seeking representation .
you want to sue wyant wheeler hellerman tetlow and brown ?
i was fired by wyant wheeler . i plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against charles wheeler and his partners .
thanks , beckett . i 'm real excited about it . what can i do for you ?
kids are great .
little baby girl .
congratulations .
one week old .
new baby ?
uh , yeah .
it 's okay . can i sit down ?
whoa-oh ! sorry , i ...
i have aids .
jesus christ , what happened to you ?
funny .
client of yours ?
i know what it means . your honor , imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel . the pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper , a tribute to mankind 's greed , grows daily , casting an ominous shadow over their lives , filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black , toxic fog , blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs ! and counselor calls it harmless ? !
defined by webster 's as harmless .
innocuous ?
your honor , i submit there were no complaints until counselor began knocking on doors , drumming up business . and the dust , which counselor refers to , has appeared on only three occasions . each time it has been examined and the results ...
your honor , since rockwell corp. began construction , the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling , germ-carrying , pestilent dust . my client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily ! other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage !
get down to word processing . help jamey look .
what can i do ?
fucking word processing lost my kronos complaint . which must be filed by fucking five o'clock ! if it 's late , there 's no case ... every problem has a solution .
i thought i was supposed to be covering for you . god , andy , you look awful .
catch me later , i 'll be here . and tell amy , i love her painting , it 's on my wall .
i 'm late , i have to pick up amy from her afterschool but i want to talk to you about that hansen thing .
rach .
thank you .
no . i ca n't really see it .
answer the question , please .
by the time i was fired , there were four lesions on my face , much bigger ...
one . here , in front of my ear .
do you have any lesions on your face at this time ?
absolutely .
and it 's your contention , that when the partners were made aware of the lesions , they jumped to the conclusion you had aids and fired you .
that 's right .
you 've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with , correct ?
yes .
really ?
miguel has not been infected . as i said , we were n't aware of aids , then , or how it is spread .
you could have infected him , is n't that right ?
yes .
is n't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you 're not , so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you ? !
in some situations .
as a homosexual , one is often forced to conceal one 's sexuality , is that right ?
some do . i did n't .
do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks ?
no .
did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk ?
that is < u > not < /u > correct . i never lied about it .
while you were employed at wyant wheeler , you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual , correct ?
no .
do you need a break ?
i 'd heard of < u > something < /u > . the gay plague , gay cancer , but ... we did n't know how you could get it , or that it could kill you .
you 'd < u > heard < /u > of aids in 1984 , 85 ?
that happened once . people were n't talking about aids then , the way we are now . or safe sex .
but you < u > were < /u > having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 ?
it 's impossible to know exactly when or how i was infected with hiv .
were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there , called aids , and that you could contract it through sexual activity ?
i guess it was 1984 , 85 .
when ? approximately what year did this event take place ?
yes .
do men have sex with each other in that theater ?
yes .
gay < u > pornographic < /u > movies ?
gay movies .
what kind of movies do they show there ?
have you ever been to the apollo cinema on sansom street ?
not unnecessary ones .
in general . do you take risks in other areas of your life ?
in my work ? yes . calculated risks . you have to .
do you take risks ?
something like that .
you said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had `` an adventurous spirit . '' is that correct ?
thanks , mom ... dad ?
all i know is , you got through your diagnosis fine , like a trooper . but when they fired you ... you were so devastated , andy ... i do n't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus . fight for your rights .
mom ?
he 's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower .
where 's dad ?
ancient . how do you think i feel ? put that thing down and give me a hug . andrew , stop ! ... he still does n't listen .
hi , mom . how do you feel on your fortieth anniversary ?
are you on one of those conference calls ? i hate when you put me on hold .
gillman says i 'm fine . my blood work is excellent . t-cells are up . just a sec ... yes , i think that would alleviate most of our concerns . my platelets look good too .
hold on , mom . there 's no way my client will go along with that .
what 's dr. gillman say ?
i 'm fine .
andy ! this is a nice surprise . how are you , hon ?
hi , mom . it 's me .
hello ?
thank you .
yes . i 'm now in charge of the paralegal department .
were you recently promoted ?
yes .
miss burton ? do you still work at wyant wheeler ?
objection .
he was losing weight . he looked kind of tired sometimes . but he was working so hard ... still , i felt something was wrong . and i ca n't believe < u > they 're < /u > saying they did n't notice anything .
thank you . no more questions .
i said my earrings < u > are < /u > american . they 're african-american .
what did you say ?
apparently , mr. wheeler felt they were too ... `` ethnic '' is the word she used . she said he would like it if i wore something smaller , less garish , and ... more `` american . ''
your earrings ?
well ... one time , mr. wheeler 's secretary , lydia , told me mr. wheeler had a problem with my earrings .
in what way ?
yes .
no . have you ever felt discriminated against , at wyant wheeler ?
is that a question ?
ms. burton . you 're black .
your honor , if mr. beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair , would the defense ask him to park it outside ? we 're talking about aids , we 're talking about lesions . let 's < u > see < /u > what we 're talking about .
we object , your honor . it would unfairly influence the jury .
i 'll withdraw it . mr. beckett ? were you living with miguel alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater ?
objection !
i 'll withdraw . you were aware , when you worked with maria torres , that she had aids , correct ?
objection !
i 'll rephrase . did you have anything to do with this file being ... misplaced ?
objection !
fact . andrew beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level . fact . he made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit ... fact . he claims he is the victim of lies and deceit . fact . andrew beckett lied to his employers , going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them . fact . he was successful in his duplicity . the partners at wyant wheeler did < u > not < /u > know andrew beckett had aids when they fired him ...
and , when lawyers break the law , when this society loses respect for the law , when that day comes , our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground , and our children and grandchildren will live like savages .
or unprotected sex with someone you did n't know very well , any time during the last twelve years .
uh ... . no . not really .
unprotected sex with a prostitute .
get real .
a homosexual encounter .
thanks , doc , but i do n't need an aids test . are you crazy ? but thanks for the information . really .
not by touching , or shaking hands , or hugging , using the same toilet ... even kissing someone with aids is safe . but it there 's something in your past you 're worried about ...
it does n't travel through the air , by breathing , or touching , right ?
right .
the guy sat in my office ! you ca n't get aids that way , right ?
you want to give me an aids < u > test < /u > ? !
joe . i do n't care a whit about your private life .
why are we going to do that ?
we 're going to draw blood .
yeah , but doc , is n't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease ? so you tell me , today , there 's no danger , and i go home , and i hold my baby , and six months from now i hear on the news : `` whoops ! we were wrong . ' you < u > can < /u > carry it on your clothes , your skin , and now i 've got to worry about my kid . what are you doing ?
leave that .
right .
the hiv virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids , namely blood and semen .
i 'm not worried . what are you doing ?
you had contact with someone who has aids , and you 're worried .
since that time i 've devoted more thought to the subject , and that 's how i feel now .
five months ago you characterized andrew beckett as caviar and now you 're calling him a cheeseburger . your standards have shifted a great deal , and i 'd like to know why you 've changed your mind .
i might .
it 's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied . a cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming . do you agree ?
it satisfied me .
did that thrill , impress and overwhelm you ?
we won .
okay , mr. laird . explain this to me like i 'm a four year old : did andrew beckett win your lawsuit for you or not ?
i may have said something like that . but that 's not how i feel at this moment .
according to the deposition , you said you were `` thrilled , impressed , overwhelmed '' by the quality of andrew beckett 's work . do you remember saying that ?
that 's correct .
mr. laird , when i approached you about being a witness at this trial , and you agreed , you gave sworn testimony in a deposition . is that correct ?
we were satisfied .
were you pleased with his work ?
that 's correct .
but , andrew beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit .
wyant wheeler represented us .
andrew beckett represented your company in a lawsuit in 1990 , is that correct ?
people who want to bend the rules ...
what kind of people ?
sometimes it seems like society is < u > run < /u > by these kinds of people .
yes , character . to the extent that it affects a person 's ability to do a great job .
explain to me , if you can , mr. wheeler , explain this to me like i 'm a ten year-old . this trial is not about a disease , is that what you 're saying ? < u > not < /u > about your understandable , if unfounded , fear of catching aids through casual contact with someone who has it ? you 're saying , this trial is about andrew beckett 's character . am i getting this right ?
... we 've got a committee meeting .
but he 's got lots of other people 's lives to ruin ...
and i hate to rush you out of here , but ...
we do n't think it 's fair to keep you here , where your future is limited . but we wish you luck , andy , all the luck in the world .
in a word , yes .
let 's put it this way , andy : your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure .
you 're in trouble .
andy . before we begin , i 'd just like to say : everyone in this room is your friend .
get a life .
you 're the asshole , buddy .
fuck you ! you want to kick my ass ? you want to try ? asshole .
do n't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys ?
take it as a compliment . geesh .
relax ? i ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you !
do i look gay to you ? relax .
what 's the matter with you ? do i look gay to you ?
are n't you ?
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa ... do you think ... ? you think < u > i 'm < /u > ... ... gay ?
would you like to have a drink with me ? i just finished a game , i could use a beer . i do n't pick up people in drug stores every day .
great .
second .
good school . what year ?
night , honey .
i 'll see you in an hour , max .
my lettuce is wilting .
did i ever tell you , i hate costume parties ?
great , lisa . thank you .
okay , so ... help me with this one , joe ... is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone 's mouth ? or , is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into < u > their < /u > mouth ?
lisa , c'mon . one guy sticking his dick in another guy 's mouth ? it 's disgusting .
two men making love ... ? now tell me again ... < u > why < /u > is that disgusting ?
yeah ... ?
joe ?
very funny . i had a box of pampers under my arm for chrissake !
have you changed your aftershave ?
is there some kind of expression i 've picked up from beckett ? ! some kind of fairy attitude i 've unconsciously adopted ? ! am i walking different ? ! some kind of vocal thing ? ! have i picked up some kind of homo < u > vibe < /u > ? !
do n't know , joe .
would you take a client if you were constantly thinking : `` i hope this guy does n't touch me . i do n't even want him to < u > breathe < /u > on me ? ''
that 's perfectly clear .
and the way they work out , pumping up , so they can be macho and faggot at the same time ... i ca n't < u > stand < /u > that shit . now i 'm being totally honest with you .
fine , joe .
i mean , two guys , doing the horizontal thing ? i do n't get it . do n't they get confused ? `` is that mine ? i thought it was yours . '' hey , call me old fashioned , call me conservative ... i think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is .
okay , joe ...
allright . i admit it : i 'm prejudiced . i do n't want to work with a homosexual . you got me .
probably since she was born .
since when ?
duh ...
your aunt teresa is gay ? that beautiful , sensuous woman is a ... < u > lesbian < /u > ?
karen berman . aunt teresa . my cousin tommy who lives in rochester . eddie meyers from the office . joe cantwell , he 's one of the partners . his lover , greg . stanley , the guy who 's putting in our kitchen cabinets .
who ?
lots .
how many do you know ?
how many gays do you know ?
not especially .
you have a problem with gays , joe .
give me the camera , joe .
you load the film ... ? no , on this side ... or this side ? do n't move the baby !
tell iris all about it . take good care of mrs. finley , iris . beckett , come in .
now that you mention it ...
of course you have a case ! now , i want you to go with my assistant , iris , and fill out some forms . she 'll tell you about our fee arrangement . mrs. finley ? any back pain since the accident ? dizziness ? nightmares ?
yeah . do i have a case ?
why should i ?
why did n't you cross at the crosswalk ?
right .
i felt , and still feel , nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like maria , who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own .
but did n't you avoid contact with ms. torres , after you found out she had aids ? she says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her , is that correct ?
i < u > know < /u > the difference . that does n't mean i 'm always able to recognize the difference .
so you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise , is that correct ?
< u > she < /u > did n't try to conceal it .
like firing andrew beckett taught < u > him < /u > a lesson ?
yes , we did .
you taught him a lesson .
we stuck his head in the latrine , after ten of us had used it .
how did you do that ?
yeah . but we took care of him .
like ... two sailors playing hide the salami .
going on ... like ... ?
so during those long voyages , months at a time , out to sea , no women in sight , a hundred , hardworking , robust , young men , in the prime of their life , at the peak of their natural appetites , desires , their god- given , hormonal < u > instincts < /u > ... anything going on ?
not when i was in the navy .
any women on board ?
anywhere from two weeks , to several months .
a trial takes < u > time < /u > , beckett . do you know what i 'm saying ?
whoa , whoa ... what do you expect them to say , you 're alan dershowitz ?
beckett ?
your honor ? may i have ten minutes in re-direct ?
this would be a good time to break for the day ...
you had one guy `` like that ? ''
let 's continue .
no . we do n't ... however , as regards this witness , i 'm going to sustain the defense 's objection .
with all due respect , your honor ... we do n't live in this courtroom , do we ?
in this courtroom , mr. miller , justice is blind . to matters of race , creed , color , religion . and sexual orientation .
very good , joe . now , belinda , i 've got a figure over here , of one million , five . i ...
based on what my client would have earned over the next three years , including benefits and projected raises , and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with acquired immune deficiency syndrome ... we would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars .
hold it , joe . he wants to come back to work , chuck .
reinstatement at full salary . back pay covering the period of unemployment and ...
by god you < u > will < /u > settle it ! if you force this case to trial , young man , you 'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days ... now , joseph . what would you require to settle this matter today ?
if it please your honor , we < u > hope < /u > to settle this matter .
on behalf of the defendants ?
i 'll take that under consideration , your honor .
i 've seen your television commercials . `` if you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others ... it should say , `` through the < u > negligence < /u > of others . ''
joseph miller , your honor . macready and shilts legal services .
attorney for the plaintiff ?
you have to make a decision : is this guy partner material ?
... to suit their personal desires , and the rest of us have to live with it .
andy , you do n't want this .
you 'll be sorry , beckett .
holy shit . did you , bob ?
wait a minute . the man was fired for incompetence , not because he has aids . you did n't know he was sick , did you , bob ?
we ought to be suing him .
andrew brought aids into our offices , into our men 's room . he brought aids to our annual goddamn family picnic .
dr. j. !
julius !
helloooo ...
andy . it seems that something has come over you , lately : a kind of ... stupor , a fogginess , a lack of focus ... earth to andy . anybody home ?
kings are out of fashion . i 'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant . it 's an anti-trust action .
it 's good to be king , hey charles ?
... it 's time to get this society back on track !
... but we should n't have fired him ...
... but now , we 're standing up for ourselves ...
i did n't tell the others , i was afraid to ...
if you feel differently , bob , you should say so , when you 're called to the stand . after all , this is n't a conspiracy .
charles ...
very interesting , bob . let 's make a note of that . andy did n't lose the complaint in his computer . he never put it in . he lied about that , too .
no matter how hard i try , i ca n't lose a file in my computer .
... keep them from that area , on grounds of relevancy . what , bob ?
i 've discovered something interesting , charles .
bob . i must ask you to shut the fuck up . did andrew beckett say `` i might not be able to serve our clients to the < u > best of my ability < /u > ? '' he said nothing . and now , andrew beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law , to sling accusations at me , in full view of the entire , philadelphia , judicial establishment . my god .
he was doing a great job .
bob . you 're trying my patience . andrew beckett is making his private life our business . we gave him kronos . did he say , `` i 'm sick . i might not be able to see this through ? ''
that 's kind of ... extreme , walt . andy 's private life is none of our business .
let 's settle with andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us .
what deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to ? what is it , bob ? !
charles ...
what about other homosexual facilities , whatever they are ?
jesus .
... interview every employee , support staff , associates , partners . did < u > any < /u > of them know andy was sick ? < u > how < /u > did they know ? did he tell them ? did they notice something was wrong with his appearance ? none of this information got to the managing partners . we know that . make sure everyone else does too ... and beckett : i want to know everything about his personal life . did he frequent those pathetic bars on camac street ?
not sure . i was just runnin ' away when this whole thing ... .
not sure where to go . i was just runnin ' away when this whole thing started . where you goin ' ?
probably okay to talk to me now .
yeah , yeah -- we 're all fuckin ' amazed . anyone not ready for this ?
you came for us ... .
it 's a fucking staircase ! go over it ! go over it !
what ? what is it ?
he died fast . and if we got any choice , that 's the way we should all go out . do n't you cry for johns . do n't you dare .
gon na lose everybody out here ... .
lookit . lookit !
do n't wan na miss this .
oh , sure . why not ? sounds like a hoot .
you mean ... tonight ? with all those things still out there ?
it was just somebody else . from the crash . he was just ... .
oh , lord ... .
assailing my fragile sense of security , that 's what .
okay , it was me . what 'd i do now ?
tell me that was you .
< u > what < /u > ?
audrey ? oh , audrey ... .
does n't seem like enough to turn back on , does it ?
three full bottles . but almost time to refill .
leave the sled , let 's go , go , go !
what 're they doing ? what 're < u > we < /u > --
bring the light !
no , we 'd never ... .oh , god , honey , you shoulda told me sooner .
i did n't want you to leave me there ... back at the ship ... that 's why i did n't say anything ... .
four fulls , one half . that mean we 're halfway there ? i hope ?
bottle-count .
well , is someone coming for us ? or are we all just gon na die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse ? hey , you do n't have to worry about scaring me .
liquid oxygen canisters inside . start ripping them out . quick hits only -- try to make it last .
but i 'm human . i know you view that as a weakness , but i 'm sorry -- i < u > do < /u > feel fear , theirs too . goddamnit , riddick -- yes . i would die for them .
you barely know them .
i would try for them .
you 'd die for them ?
no one 's gon na blame you . c'mon . take my hand and save yourself , carolyn .
but they ... they could still be ... .
just give me your hand .
do n't do this to me ... .
here . make it easy on you .
i ca n't ... .i ca n't ... .
step aboard , carolyn .
no , you see , i < u > promised < /u > them ... i have to ... i have to go and ... .
'course i am -- but does n't mean i wo n't leave you here . if you believe anything about me , better be that .
you 're fuckin ' with me . i know you are .
they 're already dead . get on board .
got a better idea . come with < u > me < /u > .
just come with me !
truthfully ? i would n't know how .
< u > i trusted you < /u > , riddick . goddamn , i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race .
confusin ' me with johns now -- fear was < u > his < /u > monkey . i only deal in life and death . all that stuff in between ? some shade of grey my eyes do n't see .
what , you 're afraid ?
think you 've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck .
i promised them we 'd go back with more light . and that 's exactly what we 're gon na do..
you 're not leaving . not until we go back for the others .
strong survival instinct . admire that in a woman .
we ca n't make it .
tell me the settlement is right there ! riddick , please !
riddick ? how close ?
so where the hell 's god now , huh ? i 'll tell you where ! he 's up there pissing on me !
as fast as you can .
you sure you can keep --
as fast as you can .
let 's drop back an ' boot up .
we 're just here to carry your light , are n't we ? just the torch-bearers .
audrey ?
one or two .
how many you see ?
so everybody huddles together till the lights burn out ? until you ca n't see what 's eating you ? that the big plan ?
get out of our way .
back to the ship , huh ?
what it 's gon na be like when we hit that canyon . with her bleeding .
what about her ?
think about what ?
canyon ahead . i circled once to buy some time to think .
< u > listen < /u > .
riddick ? what the hell are you --
hunger . i see 60 years of hunger .
what do you see ? riddick ?
saw something i did n't like .
where are the sand-cat tracks ? why are n't we still following them ?
actually ... that 's what i been askin ' myself .
we can , ca n't we ? trust you ?
been a long time since anyone 's trusted me . that 's somethin ' right there .
nobody 's gon na turn a murderer loose . i fuckin ' knew better .
but i just wanted to say --
had it with deals .
riddick ... was thinkin ' we should make some kind of deal . just in case , you know , this actually --
well , guess if it was trickeration he 'd just do me , huh ? then again ... i am worth twice as much alive . did n't know ? johns ai n't a cop . oh , he 's got that shiny badge an ' all , but nah -- he 's just a merc and i 'm just a payday . that 's why he wo n't kill me . the creed is greed .
why , what 'd you hear ?
you scare me , riddick . that 's what you wan na hear , is n't it ? there , i admit it , can i get back to work now ?
i asked what < u > you < /u > thought .
entered our minds .
an ' now you 're worried about a repeat of history ?
i got the quick-and-ugly version .
strange , not doin ' a run-up on the main drive yet . strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape .
they 're coming .
power cells .
look deeper .
then where is he ? he 's not in the hole . we looked .
fairly fuckin ' ironic , would n't you say ? slamlight 's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here . three ass-kick suns . maybe i did do a few people . but not this one . no ma'am , not this time .
heard about it . just never seen it .
slam doctor . well , we called him `` doctor . ''
you did this ? to yourself ?
show me your eyes .
all you people are so scared of me -- an ' most days , i 'd take that as a compliment -- but it ai n't me you got ta worry about now .
the ones tellin ' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine , fourth lumbar down . the abdominal aorta . what a gusher . had a cup on his belt , so i used it to catch a little run-off . metallic taste to it , human blood . coppery . but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps , that goes away . course , that 's more for winter . summertime , i take mine straight .
what whispers ?
'mean the whispers ?
tell me about the sounds . you told them you heard something right before ... . if you do n't talk to me , johns 'll take another crack at it -- at your skull .
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that . and i 'm not sure i can ... . okay , that 's a lie . i just do n't want to be alone back there anymore . if you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
what , switch what ?
can we switch ?
let 's move . just a detour . he 'll get us there .
we 'll have to carry the cells ... drag them ... whatever it takes .
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact , but that sand-cat wo n't run at night .
awright . so maybe we 'll have enough light .
possibly .
those umbrellas , the ones that mist . would they burn ? if you got a receipt ?
not sure . ten ?
how many bottles ?
spirits . anything over 45 proof burns well .
... one cutting torch ... one handlight here , two more in the cabin ... i < u > think < /u > two more ... .
it hurts them . light actually hurts them ... .
like the light is scalding it .
there ... .
i know what 's in here !
christ , you do n't know what 's out there !
cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .
just a suggestion , but perhaps we should flee .
it 's starting ... .
what do my eyes see ?
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to `` booze '' as foie gras is to `` duck guts . ''
this is it ? booze ? < u > that 's < /u > what you have to drink ?
how much you weigh right now , fry ? huh ?
we can not go through there ... .
would you rag your stupid hole !
-- tried to kill us in our sleep . paris had it right -- we < u > are < /u > disposable . we 're just walking ghosts to her .
just shut up , okay ?
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin , tried to kill us --
this does not help us , johns .
no , no , you 're right , fry . what 's to be afraid of ? my life is a steamin ' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow . so i say mush on ! canyon 's only couple hundred meters , after that we 're in skiff city ! so why do n't you just butch up , stuff a cork in that kid , and get --
are you fucking high again ? just listen to --
i dunno . nice breeze , wide open spaces -- you know , i 'm startin ' to enjoy myself out here .
i was wrong . i admit it . my bad , okay ? now let 's just go back to the ship .
hey , < u > you 're < /u > the one who got me out here , turned me into a goddamn sled dog . an ' now you 'spect me to go back like a < u > whipped < /u > dog ?
stay in the light ! everybody ! stay in the fucking --
we are n't completely stupid .
riddick . < u > riddick < /u > .
so you noticed too ?
i do n't get it , johns . what is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? huh ? is there anything at all ? besides your next hype ? got no right to be so scared . neither one of us .
you give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you . he will leave you all out there to die .
we 're just burnin ' light here .
he 'll lead you over the first cliff . you know that , do n't you ?
because you 're 79 kilos of gutless white meat , and < u > that 's < /u > why you ca n't come up with a better plan .
79 kilos .
how much ?
what the hell 's it matter ?
how much you weigh , johns ?
hey . why do n't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that does n't involve mass suicide ?
for your own fear .
smoke screen for what ?
oh , do n't use her like that , for a smoke screen .
look , we got ta think about everyone now -- the kid especially . how scared is she gon na be out there ?
we can stick to the plan . if we get four cells back to the skiff , we 're off this rock .
oh , lady . if you 're in your right mind , i pray you go insane .
'sokay , 'sokay . i killed it .
stop it , stop it , stop it !
you coulda helped . and you did n't .
my first run-in with riddick . went for the sweet-spot and missed . they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there . i can feel it , sometimes , pressing against the cord . so maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business .
anything < u > else < /u > we should know about you , johns ? christ , here i am lettin ' you play games with our lives when --
owens was already dead . his brain just had n't caught on to that fact .
< u > you < /u > made it a problem when you let owens die like that . when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team .
not a problem unless you 're gon na make --
and here you got two mornings every day . wow , were you < u > born < /u > lucky ?
you have a little caffeine in the morning , i have a little morphine . so what ?
never said you were a hype , either .
i never said i was .
you 're not a real cop , are you ? just some mercenary who goes around talkin ' about the law like --
i wo n't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot 's throat .
dancin ' on razor blades here ...
he 's a murderer . the law says he 's got ta do his bid .
you know , he has n't harmed any of us . far as i can tell , he has n't even lied to us . just stick to the deal , johns . let him go if that 's what it --
-- we need a fail-safe . bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready , when we < u > know < /u > we 're ready to launch .
you mean , if he learns that you 're gon na royally fuck him over .
may 've noticed chains do n't work on this guy . only way we 're truly safe is if he believes he 's goin ' free . but if he < u > stops < /u > believin ' --
oh , this is a dangerous game you 're playing , johns .
that 's what i said .
you said we were going to trust him now . you said there was a deal .
he also figured out how to kill the pilot , fry .
okay , maybe that 's a < u > good < /u > thing . maybe i can use him to help with --
hijacked a prison transport , made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down .
he can pilot ?
< u > get the fucking cells over here < /u > , johns . what 's the discussion ?
we 're not sure < u > when < /u > it happens , so let 's not --
wait for what ? until it 's so dark we ca n't even find our way back to --
let 's wait on the power cells .
... need those cells from the crash ship . shit , still got ta check out the hull , patch the wings --
wha ' ?
60 years ago .
let 's board this up and get the hell gone . they seem to stick to the dark , so if we stick to daylight , should be all --
so what happened ? where are they , then ?
rag it , riddick . nobody wants your theories on --
25 kilos each , huh ?
15 6-gigs here ... 90 gigs total ... other ship carries 20-gig cells , so ... five . five total to launch .
how many ?
okay , that should buy us a sys-check . but we 'll need more cells .
nothing we ca n't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts .
little ratty-ass .
thanks for the tip , johns .
you said it , not me . let 's just not let one bad call lead to another .
what , you think i 'm doin ' this to prove something ?
hey . bein ' ballsy with your life now does n't change what came before -- it 's just stupid .
nobody else is going down but me , okay ?
i do n't . but that ground looked none too stable , and i do n't want anyone --
thought you did n't believe his story .
well , do n't ask me to .
< u > we 're gon na find the body < /u > , johns . christ , you 're a cop . why am i tellin ' you this ? we got ta go down and find it .
i < u > am < /u > sure . look , murders aside , riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame . he loves the jaw-jackin ' , loves making you afraid , 'cuz that 's all he has . and you 're playing right into --
let 's just be sure .
i < u > know < /u > what happened -- he went off on the guy , buried him on the hill somewhere , and now he 's trying to --
i assume he licked it clean .
so why is n't it all bloody ?
sir shiv-a-lot . he likes to cut .
he used that ?
ease up , ease up . johns ! just tell me what ... .
... i do n't play that ... i do n't play that so just try again . c'mon , riddick , tell me a better lie ... .
like my pistola .
like what ?
sorry . thought i heard something .
shut up .
no juice , looks like it 's been laid up for years . but we might be able to adapt --
thought he might be coolin ' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us . so i left the bottle out as bait .
what ?
did n't bite .
fuck . guess i 'm more glad to be here than i thought .
so now you know .
during the landing ... when things were at their worst ... owens was at his best . he 's the one who would n't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin .
you see anybody else here ? just between you and me .
promise me . swear to me you wo n't --
hey . you can tell me , carolyn .
what 'd owens mean ? 'bout not touching the switch ?
better keep moving ... .
so i noticed . never seen a `` captain '' quite so ready to leave her ship .
no , no , i wanted to get away .
probably right .
probably makes it worse . dehydrates you even more .
tell me it 's not a mirage .
what ?
which means he went toward sunrise .
thought you found his restraints over there . toward sunset .
a very good sign . that 's riddick 's direction . you do < u > not < /u > wan na be caught in the dark with this guy .
little swamp-flu from the conga system . never shook it with all this cryo-sleep .
s'matter ?
only around humans .
i do n't need his life story . is he really that dangerous ?
be my choice . already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
we just keep him locked up forever ?
big evil ?
and him ?
carolyn fry . i 'd shake hands , but ...
amazing . i 'm johns .
hey , me . over here .
hey , who ?
hey .
johns is leaving you a gun . just do me a favor , huh ? get my crewies buried ? they were good guys who died bad .
what , you 're goin ' off , too ?
imam . we should leave soon . before nightfall but while it 's cooler .
ask if anyone has anything in cargo ! anything to drink !
well ? is it just the pump ?
somethin ' knocked us off-lane . maybe a rogue comet . maybe we 'll never know .
so what the bloody hell happened , anyways ?
it 's the atmosphere . too much pressure , not enough oxygen . might take a few days to --
70 seconds ! you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out !
owens !
and there was n't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site ! < u > that 's < /u > how they train you ! on a fucking simulator !
when captain went down , you stepped up -- whether you like it or not . now they train you for this , so --
company 's not here , is it ?
look , fry . company says we 're responsible for every one of those --
so what , we should both go down too ? out of sheer fucking nobility ?
you mean that `` load '' of passengers ?
ca n't get my nose down ... too much load back there ... .
fry ?
just tell me we 're still in the shipping lane . just show me all those stars , all those bright , beautiful , deep-space ... .
1550 millibars , dropping 20 mb per minute , shit , we 're hemorrhaging air . < u > somethin ' < /u > took a swipe at us .
oh , no . not owens , not ... . wai ' , wai ' , wait . < u > i 'm owens < /u > . right ?
you hear me ? captain 's dead . owens too .
i mean , i mean , chrono shows we 're 22 weeks out , so gravity was n't supposed to kick in for another 19. i mean , i mean , i mean , why did i fall < u > at all < /u > ?
he 's dead . cap'n 's dead . christ , i was looking right at him when --
why did i fall on you ?
rain .
oh , no . no , no , no ... .
and what about the cells ?
the sled as a shield ... .
do what i say . please .
i would rather we all stay --
do n't stop , just slow down . little more space 'tween us and them .
what ?
imam . slow down .
no , i 'm not . but < u > he < /u > can .
and you 're certain you can find the way back ? even in the dark ?
they 're afraid of our light . that means we do n't have to be so afraid of them .
riddick ?
hasan ?
quiet , please . everyone .
i saw the cut-marks on the bones . was n't a natural die-off .
for now .
one is all ?
we 're all on the same hajj now .
frightening thought .
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage . to know god , better , yes , but to know yourself as well .
you were on a pilgrimage ? to new mecca ?
`` some prophet guy . '' and a city man . but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god .
some prophet guy ?
you know who muhammad was ?
so quiet . you get used to the sounds of the ship , then ... .
one of the christian habits we < u > did n't < /u > adopt -- perhaps unfortunately . we 'll have to wait .
i do n't suppose ... .
it 's more a place where souls are found , mr. riddick .
think a soul could get lost there ? with all those pilgrim-types ?
new mecca ... .
keep going or i will !
suleiman !
get the girl back under . keep going .
suleiman !
give my blessing to the girl . she needs a spare .
he will be with us . nonetheless .
'cuz you do n't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe . and you surely do n't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe . oh , absolutely i believe in god . and i absolutely hate the fucker .
you < u > do n't < /u > see .
i see . well , even if you do n't believe in god , it does n't mean he wo n't be --
and pointless .
blessing you like the others . it 's painless .
what 're you doin ' ?
you mean ... .
which half ?
where 's mr. johns ?
there is no `` safe . ''
well ... we must keep her close , then . here , she 'll be safe if we put her between --
has anyone checked the coring room ?
has anyone seen the young one ? ali ?
listen to her ? < u > her < /u > ? when she was willing to sacrifice us all ?
she 's the captain , we should listen to --
he 's running us 'round in circles . look for yourself . look !
we crossed our own tracks .
please ... this solves nothing ... please ... .
oh , trash baby , you 're gon na regret this .
those suns got ta come back < u > sometime < /u > . and if these animals really are phobic about light , we just sit tight till then .
i had the impression ... from the model ... that the two planets were moving as one . that there would be ... a lasting darkness .
the child heard you before any of us could even ... .
we got you ... it 's okay , it 's okay ... we got you now ... .
i 'm born-again .
`` god is great , '' yes ?
all deserts have water , somewhere . god shall lead us there .
for what ? there is no water . you understand that , do n't you ?
oh , so i 'm disposable ?
she 's the pilot , she should stay close to the cells .
not staying in here another ... .
very big beads .
like an emergency life-raft , right ?
well , just a skiff . disposable , really .
did n't say that . but least this way i do n't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin ' up .
so just like that . wave your little wand and he 's one of us now .
maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india . very rare .
what the hell are these ?
i 'll need a receipt for that . for all these .
a toast to whatever he just said .
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system . here . this wooten here -- easy , easy . very rare .
king tut 's tomb ... .
anyone else having breathing problems ? aside from me ?
... then we saw this .
like who , mr. chrislam ?
just wonderin ' if we do n't need a bigger piece of chum .
aw , do n't tell me you 're growin ' scruples .
oh , you 're a piece of art , johns . they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere . or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you .
what 's one more to you ? like < u > this < /u > is the one that sends you to hell ?
what , you 'spect < u > me < /u > to do it ?
then let 's not name the thanksgiving turkey , okay ? i assume you still got a shiv .
what do you care ?
what 's her name , anyway ?
don ' look , don ' look , don ' look ... .
so which one caught your eye ?
do n't wan na feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent .
nice embellishment .
< u > trawl < /u > with it . there 's a cable on the sled . we can drag the body behind us .
sacrifice play . hack up one body , leave it at start of the canyon . like a bucket of chum .
either way , figure it 's something you can grab onto .
kept calling it `` murder '' when i did it .
look , it 's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies . it 's called `` triage , '' okay ?
what if you 're one of five ?
not if i 'm the one .
six of us left . if we could get through that canyon and lose just one , that 'd be quite a fucking feat , huh ? a good thing , right ?
just realized that , huh ?
ai n't all of us gon na make it .
they been nose-open for her ever since we left . they go off blood .
aw , this ca n't be happening to me ... .
no . she 's not .
what 're you jaw-jackin ' about ? girl 's not cut .
about the girl .
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff . goddamnit , we 're just doin ' the heavy lifting for this prick !
hard to tell , sometimes ... even for me ... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin ' each other 's gonads off . thought we 'd swing wide . okay by you ?
such as .
looks clear .
well , what 's it look like now ?
said `` looks clear . ''
< u > fuck me < /u > . you said `` clear . ''
how 'bout a cut in your gut ?
i 'm willing to take a cut in pay .
think about that reward , johns .
wan na rag your fat mouth ?
well , you got the big gauge .
i 'd rather piss glass .
not afraid of the dark , are you ?
are you fuckin ' kidding me ?
if you were me , i 'd kill us both . c'mon , you wan na sit at the grown-up table or not ?
my recommendation : do me . do n't take the chance that i 'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass . ghost me , riddick . would if i were you .
only if we both get outta this alive . and there may be a way .
you 'd cut me loose , boss ?
truth is , riddick , i 'm tired of this head-up shit . i wan na be free of you as much as you wan na be free of me .
for what ? the honor of goin ' back to some asshole of a cell ?
here 's the deal . you work without the chains , without the bit -- without the shivs . you help us get off this rock ... .
say that again .
want you to remember this moment , riddick . the way it coulda gone and did n't .
we 're movin ' . and i 'm just wondering if i should n't lighten the load right now .
found somethin ' worse than me , huh ?
well , just keep your bloody-fuckin ' eyes open . do n't want that ratbag sneakin ' up on me bloody-fuckin ' arse .
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries .
so much for my cocktail hour .
so much for your nightfall .
well , what 's the need , anyway ? if he 's gone , he 's gone . why should he bother us ?
'cuz they could n't hunt shit with these things , be my guess .
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea . very < u > very < /u > rare , since the tribe 's extinct .
an ' this ?
startin ' to acclimate , anyhow . take it .
what , it 's broken ?
take it .
just wanted his o-2 . though i notice he tried to ghost my ass . when he shot up that stranger instead .
you were tryin ' to kill him too .
i know you do n't uncrate your emergency ship unless there 's a fucking emergency .
maybe they had weight limits , you do n't know .
what , you do n't really think they left with their clothes on the lines ? photos on the walls ?
does n't need to be . use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes , stick out a thumb . you 'll get picked up . right ?
not a star-jumper .
that 's correct . and you will both stand trial for heresy .
seal the cave ?
well ? for a time the ancients kept humans as household pets . until the lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed . keep digging cornelius . you 'll find evidence of the master of this house : an ape .
no sir , i have n't forgotten .
your conclusion is premature . have you forgotten your scripture ? the thirteenth scroll ? 'and proteus brought the upright beast into the garden , and chained him to a tree , and the children made sport of him . '
a doll alone proves nothing . true . but the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man -- and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit .
to begin with , your methods of dating the past are crude , to say the least . there are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations .
i apologize .
do n't speak to me in absolutes . the evidence is contestable .
indeed , the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own . some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
i 've seen some of your fossils and artifacts . they 're worthless .
we 've never meant to be treasonable , sir . but up there , in the face of that cliff , is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts .
i ask you to reconsider the rash course you 've taken . if you 're convicted of heresy , the most you 'll get is two years . but if you persist in pointing guns in my direction , you 'll hang for high treason .
it was n't difficult . only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the forbidden zone . i see you brought along the female of your species . i did n't realize a man could be monogamous .
how did you know we 'd come here ?
yes , sir , so it was -- thanks to you . but not before i discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the sacred scrolls were written ...
he exceeded his orders . his travel permit was promptly revoked .
certainly , sir . it 's a pleasure to see you again .
you know dr. maximus , our commissioner for animal affairs ?
oh. , no. , sir . i was just assembling my notes .
did you forget our appointment , cornelius ?
dr. zaius --
certainly , sir . i 'll get my notes and come right over .
cornelius , if you have a moment today , i 'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail .
good luck then .
they ca n't convict us of that . you proved our innocence . besides ... ... his culture is our culture .
and now you know the truth . cornelius has beaten you , doctor . he proved it . man preceded you here . you owe him your science , your language , whatever knowledge you have .
that was different . we thought you were ... . inferior .
reconstructing a life . care to have a look ?
what are you doing there ?
yes . i have to agree . from all you 've found so far , his position 's as good as yours .
no . you saved me from this fanatic . maybe i can pay you back .
taylor , i 'd rather you -
shut up .
taylor , you 're not in command here . put down that gun .
if there 's any shooting , dr. zaius , you 'll be the first to die . depend on it .
right now , if you like .
when are you going to show me what 's in the cave ?
no one really knows . it 's an ancient taboo . set forth in the sacred scrolls . the lawgiver pronounced the area deadly .
you 've never told me why this region 's called the forbidden zone .
it empties into a sea some miles from here . that 's where the cave is .
where does the river lead ?
i know ... nevertheless , i thank you for saving us . you 'll be in trouble for going there .
sorry , taylor . the terrain around that lake is poisonous . there is no fresh water , no vegetation . nothing .
nothing much . the remnants of a life raft . maybe a small flag . the emblem of my countrymen .
it 's a long detour to dead lake . what would we find ?
you still do n't believe me , do you ?
to the diggings i worked at a year ago . it 's a three day ride across the eastern desert , near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours .
zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the forbidden zone . that 's what we 'll try for . what about you ?
as you wish .
just the same , i want one .
the best . but we wo n't need them .
do you have any weapons ?
well , taylor -- we 're all fugitives now .
right . let 's put the water and provisions in the wagon .
we 'd better get started . if the mounted police pick up our trail , they 'll come this far at least .
there was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us .
how did it go ?
zira ... .
a toy . it floats on the air . try it .
zira , listen to me . we 've got a fine future ahead of us . marriage . stimulating careers . i 'm up for a raise --
oh , cornelius , show some strength !
no , thank you ' . i wo n't get into that battle .
well , maybe they 're not .
because if he is a missing link , it means the sacred scrolls are n't worth their parchment .
'i am not a missing link . '
how can scientific truth be heresy ? what if taylor is exactly the proof you needed ? a mutation . a missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
that was before dr. zaius and half the academy said the idea was heresy .
you did n't think so then .
the evidence was very meager --
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate , possibly man . in his trip to the forbidden zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
it 's probably wrong --
cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
no , they wo n't -
do n't be foolish . if it 's true , they 'll have to accept it .
zira , are you trying to get my head cut off ?
but what about your theory ? the existence of someone like taylor might prove it .
i do n't . and i 'm not going to try .
'then how do you account for me ? ,
no creature can survive in that part of the forbidden zone . i 've been there . i 've seen it .
cornelius , why do you insist on provoking him ?
and even if it were n't , why fly ? where would it get you ?
flight is a scientific impossibility .
and they fell out of the sky with you ?
'dodge was killed in the hunt . what happened to landon ? ' i do n't know .
oh , cornelius , be quiet .
now , just a minute --
where did you learn to do this ?
dear , you 're a scientist . do n't you believe your own eyes ?
it 's a stunt . humans do n't write .
zira , come on . you know they ca n't -- oh oh . here comes number one .
the blood transfusion .
remembers what ?
look -- she remembers .
watch . hello , bright eyes . how 's our throat today ?
what 's so special about him ?
that 's bright eyes . the one i was telling you about .
neither do i .
no .
do you have to work tonight ?
blessed are the vegetarians .
well , at least they have n't tried to bite us .
let 's find them all .
where there 's one there 's another . and another . and another .
you 're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet . your loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries . even if you could get back , they 'd think you were something that fell out of a tree .
taylor -- quit riding him .
none at all .
any particular reason ?
that way .
which direction ?
okay . if there 's no life here , we 've got just seventy-two hours to find it . that 's when the groceries run out .
no .
any sign of dangerous ionization ?
nothing will grow here ... . there 's just a trace of hydrocarbons , and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates .
good question . landon -- check your communications kit .
but how long is a day ?
one pistol ... twenty-four rounds of ammo . two medical kits.. one camera ... one tx9 . we 've enough food and water for three days .
yo !
geiger counter ?
yo !
got your sensors ?
they 're still dirty . and their bite is septic . look at that ...
the foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals .
hmph .
that 's because dr. zaius realizes our work has value .
you do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment .
what do you mean , made it ? i 'm an animal psychologist , that 's all . we do n't have any authority .
but the quota system 's been abolished ! you made it . why ca n't i ?
these animals are dirty , doctor . they stink , and they carry communicable diseases . why are n't they cleaned up before they 're brought here ?
this place is dirty , doctor .
i do n't know . this beast lost a lot of blood .
will he live ?
him .
which one was wearing the strange clothes ?
be it so ordered . the tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . this hearing is adjourned .
yes , sir . the state charges doctors zira and cornelius with contempt of this tribunal , malicious mischief and scientific heresy .
sustained .
objection !
sustained . your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature .
objection ! these remarks are profane and irrelevant .
very well . i suggest we go and look at them .
that 's true , dr. zaius . my witnesses -- correction -- my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater .
proceed . but do n't turn this hearing into a farce .
he can reason ? with the tribunal 's permission , let me expose this hoax by direct examination .
directly , mr. president . this wretched man , the accused , is only a pawn in the conspiracy . we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture . the state charges that dr. zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal , tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
come to the point , dr. honorius .
there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith
learned judges : my case is simple . it is based on our first article of faith : that the almighty created the ape in his own image ; that he gave him a soul and a mind ; that he set him apart from the beasts of the jungle , and made him the lord of the planet .
state your case , mr. prosecutor .
well , dr. zira ? this is a man , is he not ?
objection . the accused is indeed a man . therefore , he has no rights under ape law .
show this to the president .
ridiculous . that answer is a contradiction in terms . tell us , bright eyes , why do men have no souls ? what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain ?
some apes , it seems , are more equal than others .
of course he does n't know our culture - because he can not think . tell us why all apes are created equal .
i admit , i know nothing of your culture .
tell the court , bright eyes -- what is the second article of faith ?
do as i say .
he 's vicious , doctor . besides , it 's against the rules .
get me a collar and leash . i 'm taking him to the infirmary .
i 'll see .
those fools and their torches ! do you have any ointment ?
what happened ?
well , you know what they say . human see , human do .
he 's trying to form words .
huh ?
did you see that ? it 's remarkable !
see ? he keeps pretending he can talk .
awww , it still hurts , does n't it ?
do n't be silly . he 's perfectly tame .
you could get hurt doing that , doctor .
no change . the minute you open the door , he goes into his act .
good morning , julius . how 's our patient today ?
good morning , dr. zira .
you 're our optimist look at the bright side . if that 's the best there is around here , in six months we 'll be running this planet .
we got off at the wrong stop .
try telling them our names .
no cigar .
okay .
can we take a dip ?
let 's take a look .
scarecrows ?
i 'd like to know why not . you thought life on earth was meaningless . you despised people . so what did you do ? you ran away .
but i 'm not prepared to die .
dodge ... he 's not like me at all . but he makes sense . held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew . i understand why he 's here . but you ... you 're no seeker . you 're negative .
do n't bother
okay . you read me well enough . why ca n't i read you ?
oh , and one last item . immortality . you wanted to go on forever . well , you damn near made it . except for dodge and me , you 've lived longer than anybody . and with stewart dead , it looks like we 're the last of the strain . you got what you wanted , kid . how does it taste ?
taylor . i 'm telling you --
and the glory , do n't forget that . there 's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere . it 's probably turned green by now , and nobody can read the name plate . but never let it be said we forget our heroes .
climb off me , will you !
straighten me out on something . why did you come along at all ? you volunteered . why ? i 'll tell you . they nominated you for the big one and you could n't turn it down . not without losing your all-american standing
i 'm prepared to die .
there 's only one reality left . we 're here and it 's now . you get ahold of that and hang on tight , or you might as well be dead .
all right --
what would you learn ? i 've told you where you are and when you are .
if only we could get a fix .
it 's a fact , landon . buy it . you 'll sleep better .
prove it . if we ca n't get back , it 's still just a theory .
because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they 're dust .
long pause ) you know it .
apart from that , you look pretty chipper for a man who 's two thousand and thirty one years old . i read the clocks . they bear out hasslein 's hypothesis . we 've been away from earth for two thousand years , give or take a decade . still ca n't accept it , huh ?
by our time . you 've turned gray .
then we 've been away from earth for eighteen months .
it 's a little late for a wake . she 's been dead nearly a year .
you do n't seem very cut up about it .
air leak . died in her sleep .
sorry ... i was thinking of stewart . what d'you suppose happened ?
landon ! join the expedition .
we 're some three hundred and twenty light years from earth . on an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of orion . that could be bellatrix .
well ? where are we ? have any notion , skipper ?
we 're here to stay .
gone .
forget it . abandon ship .
it 's no use ... there she goes .
to earth ! that we 've landed !
what signal ?
landon ! send a last signal .
the flags of discontent . it 's the only way anything ever gets changed . do n't try to follow us . i 'm pretty handy with things like this .
what ?
that 's the boy . keep 'em flying .
i think you 're making a mistake .
lucius .
i 'll start by following the shoreline . and my nose .
they think you 're behaving foolishly . i must say i agree . where will you go ?
yes , i can do that .
i want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner .
what is it ?
all right , all right . will you do me a favor ? no orders .
disillusioned ... but vindicated ! i 've been right all along . you ca n't trust the older generation . it 's a matter of values --
not everything . they left a hostage . how do you feel , lucius ?
relax . you 'll see it all later .
always giving orders . just like every other adult .
sorry , lucius . you 'll have to stay here and guard the horses .
in my world -- before i left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair .
why did you do that ? scrape off your hair ?
i 'm for that .
should n't we be moving on ?
fine . just let her out .
if you insist . but i 'm not taking any orders --
i want her .
zira does n't want your female .
she comes along too .
come on . get me out of here .
so you can talk . i 'm dr. zira 's nephew . this abduction was her idea . you 're not really going to the zoo . that 's just our cover story in case we 're stopped . although i do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
who are you ?
to scare off humans ?
the hunt club .
who put them up ?
keep moving . we ca n't turn back now .
gorilla hunters ...
all right ... get in ... hurry . put this on .
he would n't leave her .
i told you not to bring the other one .
at the very least , this man has the right to know whether there 's a charge against him .
and our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast , and determine what 's to be done with him .
my own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation .
you asked for the opportunity to present your case . surely you must know why you 're here .
we 're -- conducting a new experiment .
why special ?
yes , sir . but this -- creature is a special case .
i know it 's a man . and you know the rules . no animals outside the compound , and most certainly not without a leash .
a man , dr. maximus .
what is that ?
bailiff ! stop this outburst ! gag that monstrosity !
you destroyed his memory ! his mind ! his identity ! and , you want to do the same to me !
dr. zira ! silence that man !
one is in a museum !
bailiff ! make the animal be quiet .
this hearing is absurd ! let me tell my story ...
it says here that his name is bright eyes . you gave him that name yourself .
my name is taylor .
dr. zira -- tell bright eyes to sit down .
sustain all objections , but face the truth !
sustained .
let us assume , as common sense dictates , that the prisoner 's story is false . but if he does not come from another planet , then surely he sprang from our own . yes , sprang . as an animal psychologist , i have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute .
how so ?
is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ?
this is a joke in very poor taste .
stop right there . bring me that paper .
'i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system . i am an explorer in space , with no hostile intentions against your civilization . on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal , while the apes remained ... ''
read it yourself .
since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense , he asks that this statement be read into the record .
did we create his mind too ? not only can this man speak . he can write . he can reason .
mind your tongue , madame .
thats a lie !
then why is he called the accused your honors must think him guilty of something .
sustained . in all fairness , dr. zira , you must admit the accused is a nonape , and therefore has no rights under ape law .
by your leave , mr. president -- the tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry .
let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential , and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the tribunal . you may proceed , dr. honorius .
do n't look for it , taylor . you may not like what you find .
we 're back at the beginning . i still do n't know the why . a planet where apes evolved from men . a world turned wrong side up . a puzzle with one piece missing .
the forbidden zone was once a paradise . your breed made a desert of it , ages ago .
what evidence ? no weapons were found in the cave .
because you are a man . and you were right -- i have always known about man . from the evidence , i believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy . his emotions must rule his brain . he must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself .
why ? from the first , i 've terrified you , doctor . and in spite of every sign that i 'm an intelligent being who means no harm , you continue to hate and fear me . why ?
no , thanks . i 'll take freedom .
where else , but in a cage , does man belong ?
sure . in a cage .
of course , you could return with us . our society might find a place for you and your mate .
then there is another jungle ?
he might have been wiped out by a plague . natural catastrophe . like a fiery storm of meteors . from the looks of this part of your planet , i 'd say that was a fair bet .
then answer this : if ran was superior , why did n't he survive ?
cease fire ! withdraw !
tell him to pull back !
that 's lunacy . i can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that 's equally as inventive as yours . but it would be conjecture , not proof .
i do n't say he was a man like an earthman , but i 'd call him a close relative , for he was plagued by most of man 's ills . yet , fragile as he was , he came before you -- and was superior to you .
okay.up to the cave .
of course .
very well . if zira and cornelius can prove that those scrolls do n't tell the whole truth of your history ; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past -- will you exonerate them ?
twelve hundred years ago .
when were the sacred scrolls written ?
what is your proposal ?
all right , let 's see if you 're willing to put that statement to a test .
there is no contradiction between faith and science . true science .
do n't be a fool . you 're outnumbered and outgunned .
stop right there .
you 're a menace ! a walking pestilence . i do know who you are , taylor . as i know that others of your kind must live in the forbidden zone . you have just six hours to make a full confession . after that i 'll employ surgery to obtain one . guards !
i 'm not protecting anybody ! that hearing was a farce . what have i done ?
if you are protecting others of your kind , it will cost you your identity .
i do n't know .
you may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . and deservedly . the eastern desert has never been explored -- because we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . save yourself , taylor . tell me -- is there another jungle beyond the forbidden zone ?
thank you for calling me taylor . dr. zaius , i know who i am . who are you ? how did this upside down civilization ever get started ?
i admit that where there 's one mutant there 's probably another . and another . a nest of them . where 's your nest , taylor ? where are your women ?
then you admit --
because you 're not unique . there was the one you call landon --
all right , suppose i am a mutant ? why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic ?
of course .
that 's exactly what zira and cornelius claim . you 're talking heresy , doctor .
certainly not . you 're a mutant .
i take it you do n't believe the prosecutor 's charge -- that i 'm a monster created by dr. zira .
a fort ! unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . where were you nurtured ?
what about it ?
then how is it we speak the same language ? even in your lies , some truth slips through ! that mythical community you 're supposed to come from -- fort wayne ' ?
my tribe , as you call it , lives on another planet in a distant solar system .
you lied . where is your tribe ?
i told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours .
however , it 's within my power to grant you a reprieve . that is why i summoned you here tonight . tell me who and what you really are and where you come from , and no veterinary will touch you .
emasculation , to begin with . then experimental surgery . on the speech centers . on the brain . ultimately , a kind of living death .
no .
oh , your case was preordained . in a way , you performed a service for the state ... because your hearing made it possible for us to expose zira and cornelius . and now the tribunal has placed you in my custody for ... final disposition . do you know what that means ?
what about me ?
identify him , then . speak to him .
with one of them .
well ... do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures ?
god bless you .
go with god , taylor . that 's an old expression . it comes from both ape and man .
all right , but ... . ... you 're so damned ugly !
dr. zira , i 'd like to kiss you good-bye .
it 's better than going to prison for heresy .
we ca n't .
would you like to come along ?
was n't i humiliated ? by all of you ? did n't you lead me around on a leash ?
it 's humiliating .
why not ?
taylor , please -- do n't treat him that way .
taylor , you ca n't .
then tell them dr. zaius wo n't leave here alive .
he has a point . on my planet children often play with ape dolls .
taylor ! tell him .
except that he 's also the chief defender of the faith .
taylor , please --
and that 's your minister of science . honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge .
she 's not sick at all . she 's pregnant .
what 's the diagnosis , doctor ? a touch of the sun ?
you threw us together , remember ? and you guessed right . men , like apes , get despondent without a mate .
you want her that much ?
maybe not .
actually , you 're a different breed . this creature will never evolve .
yes .
are you going to take her with you ?
you 're going back to the forbidden zone ?
cornelius and i have been indicted for heresy . unless we can prove our theories , we do n't stand a chance of acquittal .
taylor -- just keep quiet and we may get away with this . remember that men all look alike to most apes .
listen-
you did this to him ! you 've removed his frontal lobes !
no , i swear -- i never saw this man before .
you ! ... you knew about this ?
second from the left .
which one ?
it 's him ... landon .
a hearing .
what is this ?
shhhh !
where have you been ? why did n't you come to see me ?
dr. zaius , i could have sworn he was answering you !
i 'm not acting ! i can talk ! how much proof do you want ?
there ! can you believe it ? i looks like he 's talking .
my - name - is n't - bright eyes it 's taylor !
speak ! go on . speak again .
listen , listen -- i can speak --
well , bright eyes , is our throat feeling better ?
in a few minutes there will be no doll . there ca n't be . i 'm sorry .
but the proof ? the doll ?
he wo n't survive . do you know what sort of life awaits you out there , taylor ? that of an animal . if you are n't eventually hunted down and killed by apes , some jungle beast will devour you .
but suppose you find nothing but a wasteland . how will you survive ?
what ?
but there 's the doll , sir .
secondly , if these 'tools ' as you call them , are unidentified , why are they introduced as 'evidence ' of anything ?
sirs : our theories have a bearing on his identity .
let them talk , mr president . let them talk .
mr. president , i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes .
he does n't know .
how sad . stuffed and mounted , eh ? dead men , like sunken ships , can tell no stories . and his other companion ?
where are they now ?
this is his assertion .
but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished ? you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture .
like you , i find it difficult .
do you believe him ?
i do not state it , sir . the prisoner does .
dr. zira -- you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert .
yes , sir .
would n't it more properly be done in your office ?
but perhaps he understood --
of course . he saw you moving yours .
he 's moving his fingers !
kill you motherfucker ! ! !
i shit on all o ' you .
yeah . back about 100 metres . he 's dead , now get going , the gooks are all over the fuckin ' place .

maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in '66 , first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin ' pieces ! give me three men , if i 'm wrong , i can still roll up that flank .
sounds pretty far out to me 'lias .
no i do n't . i do n't know what the fuck you 're talking about , elias !
you know what i 'm talking about !
what are you talking about !
why the fuck did n't you do something lieutenant !
alright , six says torch this place ! blow the weapons in place . round up all suspected vee cees and shake it up ! we ai n't got much light left .
they 're on their way ... there 's a gook village half a klik downriver , battalion wants us to move in and search it asap , something 's going on ... where 's barnes ?
tell six we need engineers here , this pos . is crawling with traps .
i remember first time you came in here taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard .
right on .
he dugged his own grave .
then you jes gon na forget 'bout elias and all the good times we done had ? right in here .
so he got a reduced and come over here . nam 's his freedom man , nam 's his pussy . three years he been here .
not the only man to meet his jezebel either .
yeah , you done said it . revenge on us .
the good lord works his revenge in strange ways .
... and you know how many times he done been shot ? seven times ! seven .
he done a year in japan in the hospital , then when he gets out , the first thing he done is re-up . four years he been in the field ...
barnes gets killed , his jaws 'd go on clacking ...
i know barnes six months and i 'll tell ya something - that man is mean , red in his soul like a dick on a dog .
sheeit , beats burning hutches anyway ...
found it . growing in a garden .
whew ! - where that come from ?
merle ? jesus ! ... patty ?
merle ?
this ai n't taylor . taylor been shot . this man chris been resurrected ...
whatcha doing in the underworld taylor ?
baaaa ! fuck it , they sold us out - so what ! what 'd you'all expect ? civilian life is phoney bullshit man . they 're robots man - watchin ' dopey television and drivin ' dopey cars , and they fuck up , nobody dies . that 's all right , you keep fuckin ' up , politicians keep lyin ' . cause it do n't really matter . do n't mean shit . so what ! whatcha want - a parade ! fuck that too ! no war time no grunt never got no respect . till he was dead - and even then ! you 're fighting for yourself man ! you 're fighting for your soul , dat 's all . remember dat . and it 's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man , wrestle with that angel ... ... love and hate - the whole shitbang show , that 's the story then and now and it ai n't hardly gon na change ...
i was home on leave y'know and everybody 's just worried 'bout making money , everybody 's out for themselves , they do n't even want to talk about it man , it 's like the fucking twilight zone back there - you would n't even know there 's a war on here . my sister says to me why you have to go there like i started this ...
that 's what he is ... baaaa !
well he ai n't normal that 's fo sure .
barnes took a bullet right there . at ia drang valley ... and the cocksucker survived - that 's baaad man . that 's his high , baby . high on war !
tennessee someplace . hill country .
bah , you 're a child , lerner . rhah do n't waste time on you .
i did n't like it .
if you 're gon na do it man , 'least do it right .
and baaaaaaa ! back on you .
this is one time we could sure use elias .
right ...
that 's right . i do n't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth , i do n't give a shit okay ... i just do n't give a shit anymore .
you do n't want to hear about it ?
i do n't want to hear about it jackson .
hey lieutenant i did n't ask for this job , i ...
i do n't want to hear your problems , jackson . you 'll get new men any day . time being you make do like everybody else .
begging your pardon lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody 'd see them - i got five live bodies left ...
these two holes are yours ...
squad ? i did n't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir .
jackson , looks like you got elias ' squad now .
you wanted to see me sir ?
next time you try that , mr. mitchell ... ..do n't . i 'm warning you .
what 's the matter , baby ? do n't you like being kissed ?
just drunk enough .
i think you 're drunk .
maybe you 're going to have to like me .
i do n't like being referred to as babe , or addressed as baby . i do n't like your possessive attitude , nor your hints of secret knowledge . in fact , to be very frank , mr. mitchell , i do n't think i like you .
how careful should i be ?
please be a little more careful how you talk , mr. mitchell .
why certainly , baby .
i think i 'd like to dance .
how do you do ?
betty , this is margo west . she wants to meet you . miss mayfield .
if i change my mind .
if you change your mind about the cocktail party , or anything else , give me a buzz .
okay . you win .
would you mind ?
do n't i even get my face slapped ?
i 'm trying very hard to be polite about it .
the brush-off , huh ?
nobody i 'd rather have on a leash .
perhaps i 'd better get you straightened out , mr. mitchell . you 've been rather nice to me , in a couple of ways . and i 'm grateful . but i do n't think this entitles you to put me on a leash .
nobody gets invited to clark brandon 's parties . they just go .
i have n't been invited .
well , how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock ? a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there .
i 'm sure you have .
we have some nice places around vancouver .
i 'm not in the mood for dining and dancing .
what 's the matter ?
not tonight .
dine and dance tonight ? i 've got fifty bucks to throw away .
do n't get me wrong , betty . i 'm not suggesting you murdered anybody , you know .

how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm ? he 's a useful guy to have on your side .
yes ?
i have a darned good idea you 're name is n't betty mayfield at all .
i think you 're a nice girl . i like you . but i can read signs if the print is large enough . it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector . a sort of tenseness , as if you were afraid of something .
i 'm supposing .
suppose i had n't known that immigration inspector ? had n't put in a good word for you ?
thank you .
no thanks ?
very nice mitchell turns .
nice room . balcony and everything . lovely view too .
you do n't know .
i do n't know .
indefinitely ?
i really do n't know .
a very small service . it does n't even ask for thanks . how long for ?
well..
i 'll make one for you . i live there .
is it ? i expected to go to the vancouver royal . should i have a reservation ?
where are you staying in vancouver royal . it 's pretty crowded you know .
perhaps i do n't take it so lightly .
or reno ? they always throw them off the bridge there , i 've heard .
i 'm going to vancouver , mr. mitchell .
vancouver , b.c .
how far does this train go ?
you could tell me your name . and where you 're going .
i 'm afraid there 's nothing i can do about it , mr. mitchell .
same as an hour ago . remember ? i 'm the steady type .
my name 's larry mitchell . i live in vancouver .
no thanks , i 've seen seattle .
possibly , miss .
they might think i was running away from something .
crossing the border this time of night they 're a bit particular . you 'd have to prove your identity , you know ... unless you 've got a passport . they might even want to know why you 're in such a hurry . otherwise they might think ...
immigration officer ?
well ... they have to service the plane ... and get a pilot down to the field , unless there 's one hanging around there still ... and then they have to get the immigration officer ...
how long would that take ?
i 'm afraid there 's nothing more tonight , miss . unless you charter a plane .
how soon can i get a plane to seattle ?
good evening , miss .
i 'm carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks . how much of a deposit would you like ?
merely for our records , miss mayfield . it 's usual for the guests who come here for the first time .
bank ?
i 'm mr. campbell , miss mayfield . purely as a matter of routine , i want to ask the name of your bank .
i 'm miss mayfield . is mr. campbell here ?
good morning . can i do something for you ?
if i did-i don't-now .
do you think i was faking ?
i think you mean that .
yes . you . you 're not really a murderer yet .
me ?
if it has to be -- do you mind if i do it myself ? oh , i do n't mean with the gun . this is no trick . when i wrote that note you have in your pocket -- that was no trick either . it 's not so hard for me as you think . i 'm not crying about it , i 've been skating close to it for quite some time . the water is cold down there -- but so is everything else . and there 's you .
this is it , betty . they 'll find us again , fog or no fog .
shut up ! cut it out ! even if i have to kill both of us --
every day of your life you 'll want me . you 'll never get over it . every time you see your face in the mirror --
would i want to ?
but the next one is murder . first the little step , then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back . you could tell about mitchell . you could tell about magruder -- and the detective . it would hurt , but you could do it . you could never tell about me .
you think magruder wants to hang beside me ?
magruder does .
who 'd believe it but you ? i took him out to sea and threw him in the water . even if they find him , what connects him with me ?
and that nasty man that followed us last night . you did n't kill him .
mitchell was dead enough .
yes . yours . you have n't murdered anybody . you killed mitchell . was n't that an accident ? it must have been . if you kill a blackmailer , you kill him dead -- so that he ca n't talk anymore .
mine ?
and i 'm begging for my life -- and yours .
it was n't the time or place . do n't worry about the note , baby . i 'm playing for my neck now .
i 'm still on course to victoria . nobody saw you get on board , nobody seen you since .
you 'll never make it . you 've out- smarted yourself .
so that i will never be found .
do n't go soft on me , baby . i 've got your note in my pocket . you wrote it , all by your own self . and i have to use it . it has to be found in exactly the right place .
i guess i 'm a little screwy . maybe i could believe it . should i try ?
magruder obliged me . no use my saying it was n't planned that way . i had to clean up . i 'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore . nobody in the world would believe i did n't plan the whole thing .
you-killed-him ?
not this one . and not mitchell .
he 'll come back ... they always come back when you give them money .
no . i paid him off .
that man that was following us last night -- he did n't come back this morning . i 'm beginning to wonder about him , too . was he really following me -- or you ?
it buys things , just like any other kind .
the money that makes you mr. clark brandon . let 's you live in a penthouse , on top of the vancouver royal . lets you own a cruiser . lets you do as you please , go where you please . you big , open-handed , generous guy . that 's the kind of money it takes , is n't it ?
nobody believed i was n't in on it . i was just a dumb-smart collage boy , and he was my father . i thought it was a legitimate business . he was a politician , with fingers in a lot of pies . i never saw the pies . they had names . for the record . innocent names . you know where that kind of money comes from , do n't you ?
what your father did does n't condemn you .
so could you . but our records were a little against us .
if it was an accident , you could have told the truth .
in a way .
larry mitchell found out . so you killed him .
i told you my father died in jail . he stole a fortune . most of it pretty dirty money . i do n't care to have that known .
including killaine ... i still ca n't think of you that way .
including killaine .
funny , i never thought of you that way . you were so close too . we were all pretty stupid about you .
that 's right .
i thought you had to be back to the hotel . to leave my -- my note .
that , and the fun of it .
if you 're doing all this just for me .
wonder what ?
i decided i did n't want a drink ... i 'm beginning to wonder .
go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink . careful how you go , we 're hitting the swell now .
frozen .
cold ?
there would be a moon tonight .
i can still see the shoreline . the moon is rising .
see anything ?
killaine 's wise to what ?
killaine 's wise . we ca n't wait any longer . here , put this on . but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor . i 'll tell you when .
you leave it .
well ?
my father died in jail , and he was twice the man i am .
you would n't like it . i 've been there .
i 'd still go through -- even if i ended up in jail .
it 's the frame on the picture . but not if you say so .
do you have to leave the note ?
it did , but it never paid off -- until now . i ought to be back within an hour . we ca n't leave until near dark anyway .
this must have cost a fortune .
you 'll be safe here . i wo n't be long . help yourself to anything you want . the galley 's through there . you can make coffee if you like .
the best interference runner we 've got . he thinks he 's in love with you -- and he 's a gentleman . come here , baby .
killaine ...
if they had any reason to . why make it tough for themselves ? why go to all that trouble ? here 's an open book . close it . no reason to keep it open . she was a nice girl , anyway . and perhaps she did n't kill him on purpose . perhaps she did n't kill the other one . you never know . give her the benefit of the doubt . leave her stay where she is . close the book . finis .
but that 's what i 'm doing . could n't they think of that ?
blonde , beautiful , and sad -- and nowhere . of course she might have run away -- if she knew how . and where to go . she might have dyed her hair . bleached it before probably . and changed her name again . but look at this note . and look at her room in the hotel . her stuff is all there . has n't a rag except what she stood up in . you do n't run away like that . not if you are young and beautiful . no chance .
and betty mayfield --
i run over to victoria . play some golf with some people i know . do it all the time . that 's why i have a cabin cruiser . custom- built.forty knots . mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure . member of six golf clubs . broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course . you have to be good to do that , and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria , in a few hours you can look right down on mr. brandon 's boat , the valkyrie . came alone ? sure . he always comes alone . mr brandon 's a rather lonely man .
they 'll look for you .
this is the ace , betty . but not of spades . they 'll find out about the other . they might know already . and when they get this -- what would they look for ? where ? out there somewhere ?
i was tried for murdering my husband . guilty . the judge set the verdict aside . there was one man on the jury -- -- but he was afraid . they were all afraid -- of my father-in-law . that man followed me last night -- he came from him of course . my father-in-law will never give up . never . he promised me that . so i came to vancouver , b.c . as far away as i can get from north carolina . and it happens all over again . almost the same thing . almost the same way . do you wonder about this --
how bad is the other thing ? the secret ?
take me where i have n't the courage to take myself .
yes . i 've never been very far from it , for a long time . will you do something for me ?
how bad is it ? bad enough for --
that was n't why i called you . why did i hope -- when i had n't any right to hope ?
there 's a lot of water between vancouver and the u.s.a. this note is a suicide note . after you 're gone where would they look for you ? why would they look for you ? darkness , and open water , and a fast cabin cruiser . and i have a pocket full of money . and if i helped you , i 'd be committing a crime , or so they tell me .
wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store . with somebody 's pekingese trying to climb into my lap . perhaps you 're right . perhaps i did n't mean it . all i know is that i 'm licked .
if you meant it , you would n't show it to me , betty . or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine ?
i have my own warrant . stop a minute , please .
i know . killaine has a warrant .
they 're going to arrest me .
no percentage in that .
i hated to go to that place . i almost went to the police station instead .
you 're probably mistaken about that . let 's get together sand talk it over . there 's always a solution to these problems . but it must be near the water . quite near -- yes , if you do n't mind waiting .
there 's another man -- right outside the booth here . i never saw him before .
cant be too close for me . right across the street from it suits me . anything else listed ?
i do n't think that 's on the market anymore . i 'd like something much closer to the water .
i 'm in the hudson bay company 's store . that man last night -- the one that followed me --
it sounds like a fair location . could you be a little more exact ?
from you , i like it .
so have i .
that 's the second round i 've lost tonight . that fellow hurt me .
no use waiting , then .
nothing matters .
it still does n't matter if i kiss you ?
try not talking .
take me home -- and forget you ever saw me . that 's a silly remark is n't it ?
anything i can do about it ?
no matter . there 's nothing i can do about it .
why ?
all right -- following me .
us ?
he was following us -- but he 's not a policeman .
he 's not a cop . a cop would n't have kneed me .
you do n't know who he is ?
he 's a fellow with a very hard knee , and he knows how to use it .
we 'll find out .
absolutely sure .
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby ?
then he 's --
could n't be .
then he 's got to be a detective .
killaine 's not that sort of guy . he said no -- he meant no .
we walked right passed him . he 's following us .
i did n't notice him .
that man over there . he was in the hotel lobby .
i know everybody . i do n't look at half of life , just the nice half , i look at all of it .
they know you here -- know your name .
why not ?
dance ? here ?
want to dance ?
at this time of night . it 's not as bad as it looks .
is this the best you can do ?
cold ?
i 'm different . i like it fine .
you , too ? my name is betty mayfield . i was born , and i am here . message ends . that 's what i told him . he did n't like it .
just who are you , anyway ?
certainly not to me .
let 's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us .
dance ? tonight ?
so there is . you do n't want to go to bed . i do n't want to go to bed . let 's go somewhere and hear some music -- have something to drink -- something to eat -- even dance .
there 's a lot of night left to live through .
quarter after one . why ?
what time is it ?
that 's putting it mildly .
he could hardly help suspecting you .
bad enough .
bad ?
you did n't have to tell him that .
there 's one thing i may as well tell you . you 'll find it out anyhow . i tried to run away -- when i found him out there on the balcony . there was n't any plane .
no thanks .
want a spike in it ?
it 's always a mistake to run away . always .
there was n't any plane .
you tried to run away .
i 'd rather wait until it does matter .
go ahead ... if you want to . it does n't matter .
that 's all there is .
he was a great boy for that . what else ?
he knew the immigration officer . he eased himself in .
nice of him .
on a train . he said he lived here , and he offered to make a reservation for me .
how did you meet him ?
i do n't .
they 'll know whether he killed himself .
sure ... but somebody always does..
no . and i 've never fired a gun in my life , are n't you supposed not to touch it ?
not with my consent , strange as it seems . i do n't know how he got in . i do n't know anything .
he got in here how ?
there is n't one.. that anyone would believe . i went for a walk after dinner , down to the ocean ... alone ... i came up and went to bed . i did n't sleep very well . then there was a thunderstorm . and it began to rain . i went across to close the french door . that 's the first time i saw him out there .
there 's one less tonight .
what 's funny about that ? if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you . the world is full of larry mitchells .
you said it was n't a tragedy .
do n't take it so big ... it is n't a tragedy .
much too late .
i know it 's a littler late for an apology .
no thank you .
dance ?
he does n't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor .
you 're sure mr. brandon wo n't mind ?
thanks for the fresh air . that felt good .
do you think i do n't ?
neatly said ... but to the wrong man . the trouble with pretty girls is that they ca n't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls . i get tired of it .
i hate to be alone . but i 've heard all the approaches there are ... even yours .
i do n't know you and you do n't know me . i made a reasonably polite suggestion . but i 'm sure you 'd rather be alone .
i did n't say anything .
whatever you say .
would it make you anymore amusing ?
i can be talked out of it . as a matter of fact , i 'd like a dry martini myself .
you 're drinking it .
no . are you really going to drink that stuff ?
and do you amuse the guests ?
i never pay for anything . they just keep me here to amuse the guests .
you 're not paying for this . it 's quite enough that you let me sit at your table .
sure . but i 'd hate like the dickens to be held to everything i 've said before , would n't you ?
as i said before ...
no.. not very well . and i like his friends even less . but.. if you really want a good dry martini..
you do n't sound as if you liked him very much .
brandon . clark brandon . fellow about my age . lot of money ... that he did n't make . former american . now naturalized in canada . social standing indeterminate . manners not quite perfect . scotch superb .
what did you say his name was ?
it 's open-house . no crashing involved . anybody in the hotel 's welcome .
i do n't need it that badly . i do n't enjoy crashing other people 's parties .
it might be worth a martini to you .
i see .
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here . he 's holding open house . i was up there . too noisy . bored .
disgusting , are n't they ? if you really want a martini , i know where you can get one .
your liquor laws..
i see .
sit down then . we often have a double up here .
no , please .
you can have the table yourself , if you 'd rather . i 'm only killing time .
right , miss .
ale . i do n't mind .
beer or ale , miss ?
beer ? well , all right .
sorry , miss . beer and ale only . canadian law .
i 'd like a dry martini . very dry , please .
yes , miss .
i understand , betty . i understand perfectly .
but i tell you -- -if you 'd only understand .
i hope he can prove it . come on . you do n't want to get pneumonia .
no , jeff . you do n't . he 's not a murderer , i tell you . he ; s not a murderer .
we know everything .
he could have killed me a dozen times . you 'd never have known .
goodbye , betty .
not sometimes . always . just because it is the hard way . you 're that kind of man , jeff .
sometimes .
you do things the hard way , do n't you ?
there 's an empty taxi across the street . if you 're so anxious , take it . he 'll know the way to the police headquarters .
but even if you were in love with me .
i know that .
what proper grounds ? you ca n't be in love with me . you hardly know me . i 'm not in love with you .
i 've been a soldier too . there is a difference . a policeman , like a judge , has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds .
what are you going to do -- toss your job into puget sound ? because i make you think of magnolias ? i thought policeman was something like a soldier . that his duty came first . however much he might happen hate it .
you 're still a police officer , jeff . i saw you send those two men away . i know they were watching me .
that 's they 're business . can i drop you somewhere ?
what will they do to you ?
i ca n't answer that .
to do what ?
you 've got a couple of hours , maybe .
i 'm enough of a copper to do my duty . my boss made it tough for me . if i do n't arrest you , i 've gone soft . if i do , it 's to save my face . i do n't play those rules .
because you think your in love with me ?
that 's something i ca n't spare you . but i wo n't do it myself .
they 'll only find someone else -- who wo n't be so kind .
time 's up . i 'm off the case .
i always wear gloves when i shoot people . a bad joke -- but better than tears .
so mitchell had handled it . afterwards , brandon picked it up . there 's no indication you handled it .
looking for peanuts , i suppose .
not quiet yet . we know who the gun belonged to . margo west . she told us this morning . it does n't mean much . mitchell took it away from her . he had a habit of going through her bag .
jeff . shall we go now , jeff , and get it over with ?
they call me jeff .
what do your friends call you ? -- the ones that know you well ? -- and like you very much ?
that 's my hard luck -- i 'm man enough to tell you about it -- and not be sorry .
very ridiculous .
palm trees against a sunset -- waves breaking on a coral reef -- the taj mahal by moonlight -- roses in an english garden , just after a shower -- clichs , one and all -- but good ones , with a lot of mileage left in them -- there 's one thing he does not see -- murder -- and murder was what he was sent to find . pretty ridiculous , is n't it ?
what does he see ?
he looks at the girl , looks into her eyes --
points very straight to her .
i 'm about to be very silly . a man passes a girl on the street -- a very lovely girl -- his eyes meet her eyes , and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart -- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd -- and he says to himself , `` there goes my lost love '' -- and it 's true -- if he never sees her again , it 's still true . of course , after a while , he forgets -- or almost forgets -- because after a while we forget almost everything . but this man is a copper . he gets orders -- routine orders -- to go to a place and investigate a murder -- and everything points to a certain girl .
there must be -- but when i 'm with you i ca n't find it .
you would n't even try there must be some copper in you , or you would n't be an inspector .
i might be able to save you . if i knew enough .
i expected nothing else .
i 've come here to arrest you for murder .
i do n't want to talk .
this is n't a very good place to talk .
there is n't anything you can do .
then there is n't much i can do , is there ?
you understand perfectly .
if i understand what you meant by that .
nobody can help me . you , least of all .
you wo n't tell me who you are ? you wo n't even give me a chance to help you ?
you 're a police officer . a very nice one -- but you have a job to do . i 'm a girl who 's in a jam , and it 's your job to keep me there . do n't go considerate on me . i might start to bawl .
we try to be decent .
you -- or the vancouver police department ?
i would n't make you talk about it . my job is the death of marry mitchell . why ca n't you give me your confidence ?
you 've has an experience that you do n't want to talk about . an unhappy marriage , for example .
the police always do , do n't they ?
i 'll find out , you know . perhaps not today -- perhaps not tomorrow . but in the end , i 'll find out .
i 'd like to believe that . it 's not too easy .
you were there when i last saw him .
we 're 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered . there are a lot of reasons . was he very drunk when you last saw him ?
is it a crime ?
but not in the investigation of a major crime , i hope .
who has n't -- one way or another ?
you 've had dealings with the police before ?
you were a galahad , compared to some cops i 've known .
true . i was a bit irritable last night . i apologize .
we would n't have met at all .
down below 's stanley park . on the other side of the trees , there 's a beach . you can see it . steveston 's over there . coast guard station . there 's the yacht club , and beyond it , the docks . the over on the other side of the inlet , there 's grouse mountain . it 's about 4000 feet high . there 's a restaurant on top of it . very nice restaurant . i 'm sorry we could n't have met in pleasanter circumstances , miss mayfield .
i 've never been to florida .
florida ?
you must come from pretty far south .
deep blue ? i 'd call it grey-blue .
care for a stroll outside ? beautiful morning . the air is like wine , the sky is a deep blue .
they 're all crude , when they do n't work . had breakfast ?
good morning , mr. killaine . i 'm sorry i ca n't give you the name of my bank -- because i have no bank at the moment . that was a crude trick .
i probably shall -- after i 've tortured you a little more .
why do n't you arrest me and be done with it .
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that .
a graduation present .
where 's you get it ?
yes .
what this ?
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him ?
stop saying you 're sorry . i want information , not regrets .
i 'm sorry .
regimental ! seaforth highlanders .
your family coat of arms , mr. killaine ?
there 's the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger .
who told you i was married ?
well , that 's not getting us anywhere . you wo n't tell me who you are , or give any account of yourself . you wo n't even give me your address in the united states . why ? unhappy marriage ?
it is ?
that 's an evasion and you know it .
you did n't ask a question . you made a speech .
please answer my question .
miss mayfield , the humor of the situation escapes me . within 24 hours i shall know officially whether mitchell was murdered . privately , i 'm quite sure of it now . it happened in your room , and you came to vancouver with him.. at any rate , he made your hotel reservation.. and you arrived together . here in this room he behaved nastily to you , and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat . a few hours later he was found dead on your balcony . would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious ?
i 'm sorry , that 's all there is .
i 'll have to know a little more than that .
i was born in new york city . i grew up . and here i am .
you probably know the type . you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world . they always have clothes , and money , and usually have had three or four husbands . they dress and enamel themselves with great care . they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell . tell me about yourself , miss mayfield .
i do n't know her.. or particularly want to .
mrs. west is a very emotional woman .
this way .
mr. reed , please , for mr. brandon . very well . have him call . mr. brandon is in his office now . mr. reed stepped out , mr. brandon .
who 's goble ?
and there 's a mr. goble to see you . says his business is personal .
all right . get him .
mr. reed would like you to call him .
morning . any calls ?
good morning , mr. brandon .
charlie 's suits me fine . i do n't scare .
i do n't like your perfume in my office . make it somewhere else if you do n't like charlie 's .
why not here ?
there 's two hundred . i 'll meet you in an hour -- where we met last night
get it in half an hour .
got the information on you ?
got it on you ?
a thousand .
sorry . another client paid for that . you can hire me not to use it .
you mentioned information .
i stick around and wait for the five hundred .
for two hundred ?
i go home and paint the kitchen .
for five hundred , what do i get ?
bluff . you 've waited too long .
if i call the police , your price will go down to a minus sign .
you hurt my feelings . i ought to raise the price to be a thousand .
i do n't know whether to knock your teeth down your throat -- or call the police -- or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose .
quit trying to scare me , mr. brandon , i 'm neurotic .
that 's a nice hard knee you 've got , goble . how 'd you like to trade it for a broken neck ?
mayfield ? oh , that girl you were with last night . you have n't hired me yet . mr. brandon .
what have you got on miss mayfield ?
$ 40 a day and expenses . expenses run pretty high on a case like this . i 'm a long way from home . i do n't have a b.c . licence . i 'd need about $ 500 for a retainer .
what are your rates ?
you guessed it . the card 's phony . i got plenty of 'em . different names , different jobs . i work out of san francisco . go anywhere , do anything . all it takes is the folding .
private eye ?
information -- protection -- you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio . that 's the funny part of my business -- once in a while , i get hired not to work . nice girl you were with last night . known her long ?
name it .
i 'm not sure i want anything from you . you might want something from me .
i 'm still asking . what do you want ?
you asked for it .
nice friendly approach you 've got . goble . i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning .
i 'm not interested in blind dates .
i 'd like a few words with you , in private .
that comedian ?
until he comes . he 's a nice guy . you 've met him .
i 'm sorry . this thing has just knocked me silly . how long do we have to wait for this police character ?
they still hang women in canada , i 've heard .
leave that one lay .
and without much discrimination .
sometimes .
you make friends quickly , do n't you , clark ?
you , killaine ?
martini .
what 'll you have , margo ?
fascinated .
let me introduce you . mr. killaine , mrs. west .
in the same elevator . it is a public conveyance .
hi margo . hello killaine . you two come together ?
i do n't like to be tailed . the lady i 'm with does n't like to be stared at . to put the matter in a couple of nutshells , i do n't like you .
what 's this in favor of ?
the new ones are fine . the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble .
how are your teeth getting along ?
i 've got good ears .
who told you my name ?
me a cop ? what made you think that , mr. brandon ?
so you 're not a cop .
what 's a buzzer ?
all right , let 's see the buzzer .
oh . that was just one of those idle questions . one does n't expect an answer .
you asked me where it all came from .
what ?
i had a father who knew how to steal .
where did it all come from ? or is that a permissible question ?
i buy my shirts by the dozen . fortunately .
i tried it once . i lost my shirt .
now and then . mostly just for the fun of it .
you do a lot of real estate trading , brandon ?
wait a minute . i 'll go with you .
i 'm afraid they do . far too often . so long .
you forgetting the gag line , killaine . the police do n't take anything for granted .
where would she go , anyway . do n't tell me you have n't got her covered .
no more for me , thanks . remember what i said . i ca n't interfere with the law .
no idea .
you do n't buy it . okay . so i still want betty mayfield . where is she ?
romeo in reverse . uh-uh . no sale , killaine .
or just drunk enough . he was with her when she registered . he knew where her room was . you were out most of the evening . there was a lot of mess to clean up . waiters coming and going , the door standing open . suppose mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself , then wandered out on this balcony , then realized betty 's balcony was just below yours .
mitchell was too drunk .
she did n't have to . he could have climbed down from here .
how could mitchell ? after that act he put on up here , is it likely she 'd let him in ?
mitchell was killed down here . how could clarendon get in to do it ? or margo for that matter .
and old man clarendon ? he had a motive , too . margo and her money .
your concentrating too hard , killaine . what about margo west ? she had a motive . i guess you know by this time whose gun it was ?
not if she knew she would n't be believed .
that could be told .
it could have been an accident .
do n't kid me . you do n't think she murdered mitchell .
information .
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her . what toughened you up ?
the only answer i have for you .
does n't answer the question .
you 'd be breaking the law .
would that make me a heel ?
i 've always thought you were a pretty nice guy , brandon . i 'd like to go on thinking so . if you tried to help her get away --
that must hurt .
i have a warrant for her arrest .
a couple of hours .
sure . let 's discuss betty mayfield . how long since you saw her ?
could we discuss that some other time ?
`` money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others . '' very appealing , especially to a poor man .
i would n't know .
i would . fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap . wonderful thing , money is . remember what somerset maugham said about it ?
i never notice the view after the first week .
thanks . lovely view you have , have n't you ?
thanks . i do n't mind .
if it does n't take too long . drink ?
time for a little chat ?
well -- good night .
i do n't .
in case you want to have us followed .
delightfully . every time miss mayfield says something , i know less than i did before . well , i may as well knock off for tonight . good night , miss mayfield . do let me thank you for your cooperation .
how are you two getting along ?
no thanks . i had some . how would you like to take a walk for , say , half and hour ?
how about a cup of coffee ?
we do , when we get the chance .
near his right hand . about a foot away . perhaps more . good heavens , one does n't use a tape measure .
it was lying where on the balcony ?
no .
i rather thought so . and before that , had you ever seen the gun ?
could be .
quite sure you had no motive ?
on miss mayfield 's balcony.. beside the chaise , i picked it up . do n't ask me why . i ought to know better .
where ?
yes , i 've seen it before .
thank you .
that 's what i thought , at first . maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party . with my liquor of course .
she does n't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train .
somebody mitchell picked up on the train . i do n't even know her name .
hardly . who 's the girl ?
would it have helped if i 'd knocked him down ?
if i can get off .
round of golf saturday ?
the usual grind .
how 's life treating you ?
that 's what i like about cocktail parties . everyone is so perfectly natural .
you 're not english .
it goes with this ... cold houses and warm drinks ... the effete englishman .
a private joke .
what ?
do n't bet on it . i 'm eccentric .
you do n't throw guests out , brandon .
want to walk out ... or get thrown out ?
how would you know , brandon ?
i would n't know . just do it somewhere else . there is such a thing as good manners .
did i do something wrong ?
do me a favor , mitchell . find yourself a nice secluded park bench .
lay off what ? this is my new girl friend . met her on the train . she 's very fond of me . love at first sight . was n't it , baby ?
lay off , ca n't you ?
what 's the matter , baby . do n't you like me anymore ?
the liquors lovely . the rest of the party you can have .
hello , mitchell . having fun ?
nothing to discuss . tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter . be grateful for small mercies .
i think we 'd better discuss this in my office , mr. mitchell .
i 'm afraid this is all for the moment .
rather more than a little something , mr. mitchell .
a little something on account perhaps ?
mr. mitchell .
good afternoon , mr. campbell .
he was very easy to hate . if you 'll look in your mirror , when you are in a better temper- you 'll know why .
nastiness . you 're nasty with words . why would n't you be nasty with deeds once in a while ? you hated him -- and i know why .
with what motive ?
you could have got in that room , just as you got in here . how do i know you did n't kill larry ?
how clumsy . i 'd never forgive myself . good night my dear .
one of these days , you 're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you 've cut your throat .
convenient , is n't it ?
they 'll arrest that girl . everything points to her .
so he did -- but he has n't told you what he saw . i have .
he saw my face too .
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun . you lied . it was obvious .
that 's not enough .
i 'm a very observant man . you had something in your bag this afternoon , something that causes you to hold it in a particular way . something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar . you went out with mitchell . none of us ever saw him again .
sardonic , if you will my dear . bust nasty . you lied about the gun .
you nasty , sardonic --
and now that he 's safe from all other women , you can go on loving him .
do n't be a fool . i loved him . he was n't worth it , but i loved him .
or -- since one is a well-known and respected guest -- one could go to the desk in the lobby and say `` miss mayfield seems to have lost her room key -- have you another '' ? they always have another .
passkey ?
see how easy it is ? perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked . or if she did n't , there 's a passkey on every floor in the linen room . the head porter has a passkey . the bell captain has a passkey . the hotel 's full of passkeys .
what do you want ?
i do n't think you locked your door .
what are you doing here ?
oh , shut up ! you have n't even got your spats on .
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair .
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again .
i 'm getting positively haggard . in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved .
thank you . it is rather late ... and i 'm not young anymore . good night .
i need n't keep you any longer , mr. clarendon .
thank you .
no , not recently . i 'm sure of that .
recently , then .
i 'm sorry , inspector , i do n't know much about..
mr. clarendon , have you ever seen this before ?
we do n't need him .
magruder 's conked out . adrenaline injections , oxygen tent . he may come out of it and he may not . as a source of quick information , we ca n't forget him .
what 's the face for , driscoll ?
men like you do n't need orders .
thanks , inspector . what are your orders about this wire to san francisco ?
the super 's just given me the sweetest dressing down i 've ever had . i 'm still reeling from it . and believe me , i had it coming . i apologize . what you think is important -- i think is important .
how important would it have to be ? it 's only murder , inspector .
catch me at the vancouver royal if it 's important .
if you 're asking my opinion , no . i 'd read it to greer over the phone . ask him if he had any objections .
would you ?
send that ?
i 'd suggest a telegram . something like this : chief of police , san francisco . a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble , address so-and-so , has been found murdered within our jurisdiction . his partner , name something-something greer , refuses to give us any information . correction . refuses information necessary to our investigation . can you assist ? signed detective sergeant driscoll , vancouver , british columbia , police .
i got through to greer , his partner in the detective business . greer wo n't give out .
i understand . pity to mess up a nice clean boat .
if you 'd seen the blood on his head -- and some body had to carry him out to sea --
swimming with his hat on ? that 's original .
we 've done that . he 's a san francisco private eye . name martin j. goble , g-o-b-l-e. had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it . goble and greer is the firm name .
you told me when we 'd identified this fellow --
i 've got a year . or a second . i 'm not sure which .
got a moment , inspector ?
i 'm an irishman , sir . an irishman is always logical .
and do n't get too logical , driscoll . in police business it does n't work . i wish it did . but it does n't
let me know when you 've identified him
i 've been on the waterfront detail for twelve years . this man had n't been dead an hour . he was n't killed last night . he was killed today . in broad daylight . that 's no drunk- rolling job .
drunk-rolling job . they hit him too hard .
you have two murders to investigate . this man 's head was beaten in . and there 's nothing in his pockets .
you 're the waterfront specialist . find out about it . i 've got a murder to investigate .
not a floater . only just dead .
floater ?
the harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water .
when you sign for it , you count it . it 's your dough .
open it and count it .
i need a receipt . sign your name across the flap .
sounds like a fair swap . let 's take a look .
you get it 's brother .
what do i get for it ?
one of those nice long manila envelopes -- sealed . not too fat- not too thin .
mr. brandon could n't be here . he might have left something for you . what would it look like ?
talk english . how do i know you 're you ?
it 'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet .
go live in a tent .
i have an appointment with him , right here , right now .
the joint 's not open , mac . who 's brandon ?
i 'm looking for mr. brandon .
a think wire -- -but very , very strong . let 's get out of here .
greer and goble in the call building , san francisco . just like you thought ... two murders in two days . different places , different methods , different people . nothing connects them , but a telephone number .
and a motive -- which we have n't got . so this could all be a dream .
you win , inspector . you win all along the line . why did n't we think of brandon before -- or did we -- some of us . yeah . of course you did . when a suspect thinks he 's safe , you go on letting him think he 's safe . wait for a mistake .
did we ever really think it was suicide ?
no suicide .
if she did n't -- if luck was against him -- he wipes the gun off , reaches the wall up there -- drops it on the chaise .
and she did give him the chance , the way it worked out .
he could have tried . if he was up there in the dark , listening , he 'd know when she came home , know when she found mitchell dead , know what she did about it . if she telephoned , he 'd probably hear that .
how did he know he 'd get the chance ? he could n't have arranged it .
i 've got to find a way to handle it , openly . like brandon .
so ?
i 've handled it . mitchell 's handed it . if i wipe it off , no suicide . if i take it out and lose it , no suicide . if i leave it here ... .no suicide .
well . what about it ?
this is the shell . what about the gun ?
you 've got a dead man on your hands . like this .
pretty big chance , huh ?
you can find out the first part . the second part you have to take a chance on .
do i know that she 's out of the room ? likely to be out of it for some time ?
you can find out .
do i know who lives down there ?
assume there is something to hid . i go to a lot of trouble . what do i do ? what would you do ?
such as ?
exactly . now i 'm the killer . and there 's something i do n't want you to know . something that would destroy my comfortable life , rob me of my friends , my position .
before i took the story and closed the case , i 'd want to know a lot more about these people . i 'd want to know just about everything about them .
they 'll probably believe you . but they 'll want to know what you were fighting about . why mitchell had a gun . you 'll tell them a simple story . they 'll pretend it sounds all right to them . now you 're headquarters . how does it sound to you ?
if i 've got any sense i 'm going to call headquarters .
you 've got a dead man on your hands . you killed jim -- even if it was n't murder . what are you going to do about it ?
should be over there .
where 's the shell ?
i think so .
was that about the right angle ?
there was n't any motive ... let 's try out the act .
maybe we 've been pretty dumb --
not too hard , is it ?
somebody did it twice last night -- in the dark .
that 's pretty risky business , inspector .
market ... it seems to me that 's a san francisco exchange .
gigi , huh ? sounds french -- one of those fancy ladies . must have been very fancy , if he scratched her phone number in gold .
`` g.g . market one-eight-four-two . ''
i guess i 'm just ballast around here .
i 'll know when i find it .
she did n't seem the type to lam out -- even if she got the chance . that stuff was all gone through last night . anything special you 're looking for , inspector ?
i 've always looked forward to it . all right , let 's get him out of here and tidy up .
right . a clean deduction from observed facts . they 've got to be simple once in a while , inspector .
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer .
unless the gun was slanted up .
so the shell ought to have gone over ?
this make of gun throws a shell backwards , high , and to the right . the chaise is only about four feet from the wall .
correct , inspector . a woman 's gun . u.s. 125 caliber ammunition in it . it was on a table in there .
pearl-handled .25 automatic , uh ? no , it 's a belgian gun ... 6.6 mm .
it 's her room . she only got to the hotel this afternoon , . with him . i guess he took too much for granted . here 's the gun .
i 've met her .
... i supposed you knew her , too , inspector .
they tell me he 'll be a great loss to the liquor trade . this mayfield girl ...
i knew him . he was easy to dislike , poor chap .
i hate to pull rank on you sergeant , but once in a while ... for moral purposes ... you might address me as `` inspector '' . in moments of extreme desperation , you might even call me `` sir '' .
right .
so it seems sergeant .
you in charge here ?
you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun -- and not as an accusation , but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession . very neat . good morning , mrs. west .
and if you did n't believe me ?
sure . you did n't come here in person just to tell me about the gun . you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell . if i believe you , it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night .
now , you 're being beastly .
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems .
i do n't understand .
i 'll investigate mr. clarendon 's financial position --
it does . may i go now ?
not if it clears the air .
at first , it does n't hurt at all . that 's shock . then it hurts terribly -- you would n't believe such pain could exist -- and six months later you ca n't remember what pain felt like . it has n't taken six months this time . it has n't even taken twenty- four hours . is that a beastly thing to say ?
mortar shells are not funny , either .
did you ever have a serious operation ?
you did n't play it for laughs last night .
yes -- and he 's already becoming vague to me . funny ! last night i was furiously jealous . jealous of what ? i out that gun in my bag deliberately . who was i going to kill with it ? a girl i did n't even know ? a man i knew to be a thief and a forger ? a half-man ? a gigolo ? it 's already ludicrous . love ! what a comedy !
that depends upon your motive . you were in love with mitchell , were n't you ?
i am a fool .
of course not . thanks for telling me . i have n't seen mr. clarendon .
you could n't possible have traced it this soon -- not possibly .
it was clarendon . he knew i had the gun in my bag .
other people always know so much more than we know -- so much more than they 're willing to tell us .
how did you know ? clarendon . you cops never tell anybody anything , do you .
remember that time , did n't i ? good morning mrs. west . does your visit here mean you 've changed your mind ?
thank you very much , mrs. west .
i 'd be delighted to ... anytime you can show me the doubt . i 'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her .
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt ?
anybody could commit suicide , if he felt low enough . i 've felt it myself .
i shall . from your knowledge of mitchell , would you say he would be likely to commit suicide ?
i was in love with him ... which shows you the quality of my brains . why do n't you ask her about the gun ?
you knew mitchell pretty well , did n't you , mrs. west ?
not quiet yet .
what about me ?
positive ?
i never saw it before .
warm water , no doubt .
scotch and plain water , i think .
are you always this witty ?
oh nothing .
may you what ?
i never wear a hat . oh , so i am . i forgot . i guess i 'm terribly sorry again , mrs. west .
oh , the coldstream guards . do n't you take your hat off in elevators ?
brandon handled the money envelope .
the card says so , does n't it ?
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon ?
i 'll take your word .
you 'll have to take my word for it . we do n't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison .
she might .
mayfield ? she fit into this ?
try betty mayfield . the mitchell case .
so far .
that leaves two strangers .
he checks too .
how about magruder ?
no doubt about that one .
four different people , inspector . three men and a women . i 've made slides for two . they handled both envelopes .
i 'm interested in who handled it .
yes , i think so . here are two glazed manila envelopes . one is the bag type . the other one had the money in it . do n't ask me how i know . i know .
you think i 'm wrong about this bit of a girl . go out and prove it against me !
what are my orders , sir ?
get out of here !
this badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk . it is not a thing you can give up as of no value . it may be taken from you -- and you may die defending it . but you 'll not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with . it 's a naked steel of the sword of justice . put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it -- and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now .
not too far , i hope .
you 're a young man . you 're romantic . you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together . you think a soft voice means a soft heart . you 'll grow out of that .
nor i. this is why i gave it to you .
there are people in this world who do n't think a police badge is a badge of honor . i 'm not one of them .
two .
i believe you won decorations during the war .
i do .
but you still think she 's innocent .
i think you 'd be entirely justified , sir .
`` physical description : age 26 , height 5 1 3/4 inches : weight , 188 pounds : light brown hair : deep blue eyes : small , perfectly formed features : ears and earlobes small : slender build : wears size 4 aa shoe : quiet refined manner : new york accent : no charges pending . no prior criminal record . mayfield , mother 's name . air-mailing you photographs today . signed hubert tollison , chief of police , greenwater , north carolina .

'' have ye any comment , killaine ?
yes , sir .
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases , does what she pleases ?
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield 's toilet articles . washington ought to teletype us within a few hours .
ye have , have ye ?
i disagree , sir . as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion , the right to act on it .
this girl is a murderess , killaine .
nobody 's covering her , i detached the officer assigned to that duty .
well , find out . who 's covering her ?
i do n't know , sir .
it wo n't look pretty good on your record , killaine . where 's the girl now ?
a little of both , sir , and perhaps not quiet enough of either .
are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop ?
when i give an order , you 'll not need it interpreted . you have an hour to make your mind up . well , are ye satisfied , mr. mitchell ?
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield ?
aye . you have a point there .
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment .
i hear she 's a very pretty girl .
no .
she 's the only one who had a dead man in her room . the only one who wo n't give an account of herself . the only one who tried to run away . and the only one , so far , i 've been told , who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes . what more do you want ?
she 's a suspect , naturally . but not the only one .
i 've explained the situation to mr. mitchell up to a point . now about this mayfield girl ?
how do you do , sir .
killaine , this is mr. mitchell , senior . young mitchell 's father . he just flew in from toronto .
unsophisticated ? if i knew about this babe ...
you 're very attractive , my dear . and you look very unsophisticated .
i say yes !
she is beautiful . and young . no thank you .
in that case , there 's someone here i 'd like to introduce to you . over there .
i have no intension of being nasty , mr. mitchell .
be nasty .
it 's quite unimportant , mr. mitchell . after all , you got what you wanted .
i 'm sorry . i forgot about calling for you .
in an hour , larry .
right .
a girl you meet on the train . excuse my bringing it up again . be back in an hour . right ?
i told you she 's just..
how about your new friend ?
of course .
oh , forget it . clark brandon 's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening . take me ?
i did n't mean it that way i 'm sorry .
you already have the checks , darling .
it 's against the law to cross the border with a gun . the canadian police might like to know about this .
years , why ?
how long have you had it ?
what does it look like ?
what 's this ?
kind or not kind . what 's the difference ? it always ends up the same way .
that 's not very kind .
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself .
i seem to recognize this routine . first the kiss then the touch . oh , what 's the use . you 're you .
it 's the only pose i have left . i 'm sunk . broke . i do n't even have my hotel bill .
you do n't have to make a pose of it .
i 've always been a heel . i guess i always will be .
she is much younger than i am . that 's something i 'm going to have to get used to . is n't it , larry ? they 'll all be much younger than i am . here . tear them up .
what 'll we do about it , margo ?
correct . i could n't even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me .
you 'd go to jail . for a long term .
i have a rough idea .
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police ?
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared . i was n't lucky .
splendid . now she can return the compliment .
i do n't . my hunch is she 's just torn up an unhappy marriage . i was able to do her a small favor .
you ought to know why .
rich ? i have n't the faintest idea . why ?
she 's very beautiful . she 's much younger than i am . and she 's rich , i hope .
margo , darling . you washed me up . remember ? we 're just friends . you wanted it that way .
as thoroughly as i could . it was n't easy . but you are helping me .
you should n't . you washed me up very thoroughly .
why should i mind ?
she 's just a girl i met on the train . you do n't mind do you ?
nice .
her name 's mayfield . betty mayfield .
who 's the girl ?
so-so .
with your charm ? how could i help it ? have a nice trip ?
i 'm afraid you 're not very glad to see me , margo .
oh , many things . inertia ... stalin and the cold war ... a failure of nerve . we took the seediest , most inefficient fifth of the economy into state care , paid out millions for it , put the same old duffers in charge . a new broom with very old bristles . when the tories were returned , i went and sat in the bm and wrote my little book on chartism .
what went wrong ?
did he ? i left school and worked for the labour party . my older brother , george , had just been killed in greece , and he 'd been an active member . i hero-worshipped him . he was 25 years old ... it was an exciting time for us , those first couple of years after the war . we thought the country was about to become a true democracy . i can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time . they feel betrayed . they want to know what went wrong .
did n't evelyn waugh say that the country under atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation ?
then i began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now the war had just ended , and the language was much the same as it had been before the first reform act . a small minority thought that england was really theirs , they had made it , they owned it . the rest , the wage earners , were foreigners , outsiders intent on wrecking it all .
yes .
shall we go ?
well , we were just ...
hello . anyone for a walk ? tom is n't , i can tell you .
these are transcripts of various radio broadcasts , including gaitskill 's , the one they tried to stop . you ought to have that ...
i will , thanks .
the references are to hansard or to newspapers . i have n't got the actual speeches now . you 'll have to chase them up .
we 'll see you next week , and if --
thank you .
do n't be silly . i 'll look out some more suez material for you . you 'll be very welcome .
well , i 'd hate to be a nuisance .
she 'll be here next weekend . why do n't you come too , james ? i 'll * show you the marshes properly . if you 're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from siberia .
yes .
it 's a pity she could n't make it up here today .
actually , we 've only just met . but we 're quiet good friends .
i do worry about susan . have you known her long ? she has n't mentioned you .
i think you 'll do very well .
you 're kind to be so encouraging .
if you like . but do n't be too modest , james . the citizen 's duty is to remember , not necessarily to write books . you are highly qualified . you 're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job . every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history . a genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you .
so i can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.i shall be fulfilling a citizen 's duty .
thanks .
here i am lecturing you . have some pt .
if we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost . everyone must have a memory , everyone needs to be a historian . in this country , for example , we 're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present .
history books are first onto the bonfires .
to james . i remember what it was i was going to say . we were talking about forgetfulness . the czech writer kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting .
to ann .
and i 'd like you to call me ann .
please do . i was beginning to wonder who this mr. penfield was .
since you are a friend of my daughter 's , i think i 'm entitled to call you james , do n't you think ?
it 's fine , thank you .
my husband apologises for not joining us . it 's not too cold for you , mr. penfield ?
good . suez was a minefield for both parties .
yes .
i see . are you a socialist , mr. penfield ?
well , i am a great admirer of your work . i read your books on chartism when i was still at school . i 'm a journalist , not a historian . there are questions of method , and approach . i wondered --
it was n't much more than a pot boiler.suez was very important for our generation . i did n't want it to be forgotten . and that 's why i 'd like to be able to help you . but really mr. penfield , i looked through my notes before you came , they 're all very much out of date , there 's been so much published since . i do n't think i 'm your man .
what a shame .
my first husband worked for the bbc . i doubt if anyone there remembers him now , just another long dead diligent administrator . he would have been useful in the fight to preserve the bbc 's independence during the suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about . i became involved too . i started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of suez . then he died , and i loots the will to write it . by the time i was over his death , other books had been published , and it was n't worth going on .
he was delightful .
he 's a little unhappy . i hope he was n't a nuisance ?
tom , daddy would like to see you in the garden . and will you ask betty to bring us some coffee . and remember to say 'please ' .
it 's kind of you to see me .
mr. penfield . i am sorry to have kept you .
i 'll suggest it . remember though , we 're news , not features . it might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police . anyway , i 'll be back with this soon . thanks .
but what we need is national coverage . it 's difficult with this falklands madness going on . do you think you might be able to do something when you get back ?
terrific .
very good .
give them here . this tells you how the women 's peace camp came to be set up . all local women at first , then we had support from women and men all over the country .
that does n't matter . as long as we can get our message through to someone there . jill , where are those handouts ?
but i 'm not an interviewer or a correspondent .
this is jill , carol , betty , mandy , louise , pete over there , and i 'm carmen .
penfield . james penfield .
now first of all , tell us your name .
sit on that log , dear .
thank you .
exactly that .
aha . james giving some woman the old heave-ho .
look , i 'd rather you did n't ask me questions . i ca n't talk about it .
no . that 's terrible , charles . what happened ?
she 's fine . well , actually we 've broken up . it 's all over .
how 's mary ?
keep me company .
i 'm not sure i can face it .
working hard on that book i was telling you about . coming to the meeting ?
not too bad , thanks . how have you been ?
charles ! i did n't know you were back . have a good holiday ?
a glamorous young lady way above his station ...
congratulations . who with ?
it need n't concern you , edward . james has got some news . he needs a poet 's advice .
why , is there a new foreign secretary ? who was the old one anyway ?
of course .
attributed ?
i see .
committed to memory . forever .
do n't tell me you 've actually read it , jeremy .
it 's terribly good .
and to history .
it 's everything we wanted . a very good read . a terrific piece of work . so , here 's to you and suez .
thank you .
james ... i ca n't begin to tell you how pleased we all are . congratulations , and i really mean it .
like i was saying , the american angle in suez is very important . i would n't want to say they let us down . i think that 's wrong . a good ally is one who does n't back you up in your mistakes , who tells you when to pull back . and the americans were good allies . simple as that .
you know the lingo . jolly good . so your language will have to be simple , not stupid , mind , but simple , very , very simple , and always remember it 's an american readership .
freshman and sophomores ...
personally james , i 'm very excited by this new arrangement we have . it gives us direct access to literally hundreds of american collages . twentieth century history is a growth area over there , do n't ask me why . your readership will be first and second year american collage students ...
thank you .
and you 'll join me in a sambucca ?
yes , please .
are you going to have coffee ?
i 'd want to set out events as they happened . the way i see it is this : the british empire was an ideal . it may have become totally obsolete by the middle of this century , but it was n't totally dishonourable to try and defend its remains and try and salvage some self-respect , which is what i think the conservatives were trying to do . then there 's the essential --
good .
no . i 'd want to --
yes ... you 're not a socialist then ?
... from all the moralising and talk of national humiliation that is now the standard line on suez ...
and some of that . sorry .
... break away completely from --
i 'll have some of that .
no thanks . i 'd like to break away --
would you like a dessert ... i 'm having one .
i wo n't introduce you all by name . basically james , this is our uk sales team . what was i saying ? yes , these graduate trainees ...
hello .
i know , i know ! gentlemen , let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to the cold war . james penfield . he wrote the opening chapter , on 'the berlin airlift ' . one of the best chapters in the book .
i know . i 'm sorry .
we do n't seem to get much time to talk .
oh ... excuse me . there 's nicholas .
shall we have a drink or something ?
why not .
in your car
that 'll be fun
he 's making plans for brighton . he thought we could travel down together .
what did he want ?
jeremy phoned this morning
yes . might . remember , you 're here to talk to my mother .
might ?
might ?
i might .
look , will you come on a walk with me tomorrow ?
he 's all right , the professor .
no . it 's a bit of a madhouse . for some reason a lot of my mother 's friends specialise in monologues .
i have n't seen much of you .
well , you should .
i have n't really thought about it .
do you think she 's invited you up for her sake or for mine ?
no . we talked about history , and siberian geese .
did she talk about me ?
i think she liked me .
i think we 're ready now , thank you . and how was norfolk ? did you get on with my mother ?
you just might .
i might see you in norfolk over the weekend .
i bet . thanks for the drink .
in radio we 're different .
i do n't trust anyone . that 's what comes of working in television .
you do n't trust me .
too late . just my luck .
two or three years ago i would have stayed . and fucked you .
me too .
i have to be up early .
why not stay ?
yes , if you like . call me at work .
again ?
well , you know ...
very thoughtful .
i called you a taxi .
who ?
damn . they 're early .
that must be rather nice , in a way . i mean , you do n't have any --
both dead .
it makes me weepy just to remember it . so we were fine again , and then she got married to matthew who 's a womaniser and a bit of a yob , but quite nice really , makes tv commercials . what about yours .
how nice .
mummy and i , we were more like lovers , really , or sisters . then a couple of years after daddy died , and not long after i left oxford , she started seeing various men and i was furious . i really was upset . i stopped going home . i never phoned . i went round telling everyone how awful her books were . and she hardly seemed to notice , and that made me angrier . then i got a job i was interested in , and i started to see lots of men , and i suppose i grew up a little and began to understand . so i wrote her a long letter , almost seven pages , saying how sorry i was , and how i was worried that we were drifting apart . and do you know , she wrote me a poem , a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters .
yes . you 're much too old to making a drama out of alienation , or whatever you call it . you 've got to take responsibility for your own happiness . that 's what i think anyway .
oh yes ?
i think you 're exaggerating . and if you are n't , you should jolly well change your job .
no , there 's a fourth . numbness . you do everything right , but you feel nothing either way .
and you 're at this third stage
everyone describes the same process . at first it is exciting . you 're at the centre of the world . as soon as anything happens , you 're the first to know about it . and there are deadlines a dozen times a day , even more , and that 's intimidating and exciting . then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off . your a clerk in a rather dowdy office . there 's none of the glamour of television , or the penetration of serious journalism . you 're a processor of semi-official news . some people leave at this stage . then , if you hang on , and especially if you 're promoted , you discover a new kind of pleasure . you 're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts , by the way you ca judge length . ending a broadcast on the dot , having everything run smoothly , selecting a running order that makes sense , knowing instinctively what you can and can not do . professionalism .
my real father ? well , he was a flashback .
too bad . what did your father do ?
good theory . but i like my mother . i have no aversions to what she does .
you do n't like flashbacks because your mother 's a historian .
really ? i thought those long flashbacks were extremely good .
and the shape of it all . it was sort of ... shapeless .
oh , but he was terrific .
and i did n't like that man .
i could n't bear for it to end .
i think it went on rather too long .
i thought it was tremendous .
i quite liked it . i was n't as enthusiastic as everyone else .
what did you think of that wadja film ?
no , it 's all right . i can get a cab . night night .
can i give you a lift ?
yes , that 's right . i 'm being terribly rude . bob ? oh , bob . this is bob tuckett . bon was at oxford too .
thank you . we met last week , at the wajda film . you wo n't remember . we did n't actually speak .
was that your chapter , then ? it was very good .
that 's her .
so it 's all worked out perfectly ...
i 've known susan for more than fifteen years . james , we 're old allies .
you 're a piece of shit
it might have worked . really . i would have been delighted for you if it had . but she was n't interested . not my fault .
my god . you even cooked up that norfolk trip .
and you were obviously getting nowhere with her . i was waiting for the right moment to tell you that .
fuck off .
susan and i are very old friends , james .
are you up to something ?
big mistake , i think . you might have learned a lot .
yes , finally .
six onion bajees ! great girl . did you shake the mother off ?
i 'm not sure .
still in love ?
i 'll ring you .
i 'm off . let 's meet . you promised to tell me about norfolk .
perhaps i will , then .
will it be fun ?
delivering gossip and goodwill . it seems we 'll both be doing brighton . perhaps you should come too .
sorry . got held up . what are you doing here ?
fortunate that i was here to keep susan entertained .
tame those rights ... you know , we 're even freighting in a couple of exiled argie trade unionists from paris for a tv tie in . one of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police . the other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police -- yes my good man ?
hold those rights .
on the torture of very small children , but do n't start telling them about their rights --
the torture of small children --
well , everyone 's desperate for a new falkland 's angle . purdy 's come up with a real dog . worker 's rights in argentina . so i 've been running round getting people to do things . but no one 's keen . workers rights . when did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights ? i said to purdy , `` look , tits , bingo , jingo , horoscope , sport , celebs , gossip and the occasional firm stand on -- ''
what have you been up to ?
far too long .
we 've been playing ten minutes for christ sake .
that 's enough of that .
no need to thank me , if you do n't want to . just pay for these drinks .
you 've really got it all worked out , have n't you ?
according to this , the daughter goes up to stay quiet often . you 'll need to get yourself invited for the right weekend .
ha ha ...
she 's very nice , apparently . lives in norfolk . and very left-wing . you 'll have to watch yourself there .
you 're so gross .
it 's obvious what you have to do . your way into the daughter 's pants is through the mother , up the suez canal ...
mmm ...
she 's never written a book in it , but she clearly knew a lot .
ah , ah . there 's more . the piece celebrates the undying affection between eminent left-wing historian and he dazzling daughter . then the news editor , who happened to be in the room , said that years ago , when he worked on the guardian , anne barrington had written a very good piece on ... guess ... suez . it was 1966 , the tenth anniversary .
let me see .
... an innocent interest , and found out that last year vogue ran a series called 'mothers and daughters ' number seven , anne and susan barrington . being a decent loving friend i went to the files and made a copy for you .
oh yes .
you 're so hard . all right then . i was chatting to some people from the diary page , and the name of barrington came up . i expressed an interest ...
jeremy , just let me see what you 've got .
get way . you 'll see when i 'm ready . first i want you to reflect on my noble behaviour , on how your interests are closest to my heart , how i lay awake at night worrying --
let me see .
you approve !
it 's shit .
uh-huh . tell me what you think of this first .
come on . hand over .
now , top secret file .
the argies .
and the argies .
to the fleet .
to the fleet .
name so susie barrington . daughter of the eminent historian , anne barrington , step-daughter of the scandalous matthew byrd the acclaimed sack-artist ...
bastard .
no jokes . james is in love .
c'mon . i do n't want any jones about this .
we were just chortling over that . blas and epicene . it perfectly describes the new foreign secretary . so -- i hope you do n't mind , edward , i pinched it for my piece today .
blas and epicene .
nonsense .
one or two . a grey lot . some social democrats . some diligent anti-communists . a political section man from the us embassy . and this exquisite californian wine , courtesy of the cia .
not yet you know any of these people ?
any sign of the goddess barrington ?
to the airlift .
to the airlift .
not here .
they do n't count .
what about the cromwells ?
it goes from henry viii . henry viii , edward iv , mary , elizabeth i , james i , charles i , charles ii , james ii , william and mary , ann , george i , ii , iii and iv , victoria , edward vii , george v , edward viii , george iv , elizabeth ii .
all right .
do you want to hear my list of english kings and queens ?
suez . 1956 .
what period ?
not at all . history .
have you come to talk about me ?
oh , i see .
she 's not my mother , anyway . my mother 's in italy .
okay , i will .
why not sit down and wait ?
thanks .
she said awfully sorry , make yourself comfortable , she wo n't be long . .
i 'm waiting for your mother .
hello .
hello .
next time tell her i 've gone away .
i 'm terribly sorry . he does n't seem to be here ... no ... yes , if i see him , i will . .. goodbye . she 's going to phone back .
i 'm not here .
it 's that lady from norfolk again .
terrific .
fifteen news items . i got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk . they 're all old pros .
not bad .
take a look at these .
wait ... and with talks at the united nations still making little progress , tension and anxiety settled on mps of all parties in westminster . speaking on the jimmy young show earlier today , mrs thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging . what is it ?
i 'll ring you in the next couple of days .
the bed 's all made up if you want to stay .
i 've got to be going . i 've got a meeting tonight .
or a beer . i 've got some in .
no , thanks dad .
now , are you going to have some more tea ?
yes , you said .
and joe ramage - do you remember him ? he comes and helps out in the shop .
that 's good .
everyone 's been marvellous really , jimmy . the neighbours come and sit with her while i 'm at work .
oh she knows you 're very busy , especially now , with everything going on ... the doctor said to try her on solids , but she 's been right off her food ... you take this up to her . tell her you made it . she 'll like that .
i 'm sorry about saturday , dad . it was just impossible to get away .
well , she does n't complain much . you know what she 's like . she keeps asking when you 're coming ...
so how is she ?
come into the kitchen . i 'm just making your mother 's tea .
dad .
hello , jimmy .
no , no , let me go on before you get the wrong idea . ann and i have kept to our separate bedrooms for the last three years . and i ca n't imagine that susan has n't hinted at the kind of life i lead in london . i 'm not telling you how to run your affairs . i 'm just saying ... i do n't mind . i 'm giving you permission .
now listen ...
you were n't really interested in suez at all . incredibly enough , you were interested in my wife .
she said that ?
susan told me that your visits to norfolk had ... well , an ulterior motive .
in fact it 's the invention of an advertising campaign they ran in the early sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs . a completely successful fabrication of the past , the ploughman 's lunch was .
u-huh .
ploughman 's lunch . traditional english fare .
i dunno . ploughman 's lunch .
what would you call it ?
yes .
i 'll tell you another thing . we might have led the world once into the industrial revolution , now we lead with television commercials . we 're the best , it 's as simple as that . even the americans will admit it now ... the camera work , the acting , the scripts , special effects . we 've got the lot . nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films . that food you 're eating .
well , it 's worth seeing .
no .
i just might give you a ring when we get back to london . there 's one or two things i 'd like to ... will you let me have your number before you leave ? have you ever watched a commercial being made ?
no , he was n't . he just lowered himself into a bar stool and said ... 'oo i do feel bad . i 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees ! '
then one of them was sick all over your new dress .
it 's true ! i was here last year doing a piece , remember ? i was in the bar with all these northern trade unionists and their sponsored mps . they were all incredibly fat and beery , huge trousers and braces . and so sweet . they all stood round me like children saying 'you ! working for television ? you 're just a young thing . ' they would n't let me buy drinks even when i told them the programme was paying . they kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'oo , can i ? '
it 's because he desires you . the women get all the breaks at these conferences .
it was incredible . he came back , made a pompous little bow and said , 'my dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish . ' and he 's promised not to talk to the press .
promise .
promise ?
we 'll see what we can do .
oh , yes ! where 's mine ? i want to look like you .
you 'd look naked without one .
what have you got there ?
voila !
do n't point it at james !
they wo n't let you in without one .
oh no !
darling susan . you look like an angel . but where 's your hat ?
we might be able to dig out a couple of suez survivors for you .
it was last year .
in that case , you should meet my very dear friend , james penfield . brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the berlin airlift .
we 're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools . world history since 1945. twelve programmes , lots of stock film .
and you 're so beautiful . what are you doing here ?
you 're so famous now .
darling susan .
jeremy ! how fantastic .
actually , i 've been once today already . i 'll stay here with him .
no .
do n't you want to walk , tom ?
tom . .. bed ! go on .
ah , susy , it ...
'night .
i wo n't . goodnight .
do n't close the door . do n't turn out the hall light .
i asked them to give me a couple minutes ...
you never were ...
i 'm not fbi anymore .
and i always knew i could count on you , agent utah .
jesus christ , bodhi !
wild ride , huh ?
shit ! !
three seconds ... two ... one ...
well that 's the only way it 's gon na happen , man . do it ! come on , you want to do it . you 're gon na die , johnny . five more seconds . four ...
pull it right now or i 'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself !
go on , johnny . pull it . but you got ta drop the gun , first ! right ? ! you use your other hand what you gon na hold on with ?
naw , you pull it !
no games , bodhi . pull the cord ! now ! !
pretty radical , johnny . even for you . why do n't you pull it ?
what if your chute fails , bodhi ? rescind the order . let her off the hook , she 's served her purpose . do it , man , you owe me that much . let me hear it before you check out .
why should i ?
the guy you killed was an off duty cop ! if you get out of here they 'll nail you wherever you land . they have a new thing called radar . maybe you 've heard of it .
i say when it 's over !
look , bodhi man . people are dead . the ride is over .
and let my policy expire ? sorry .
you got ta tell me where she is .
around somewhere . listen , i 'm in kind of a hurry , johnny u. what can i do for you ?
where 's roach ?
good guess . there 's a gun on you right now .
but you 're not alone .
i 'm not armed .
wild , ai n't it ? ! see , we exist on a higher plane , you and i. we make our own rules . why be a servant of the law johnny u ... when you can be it 's master ?
bodhi , this is your wake up call , man -- i ... am ... an ... eff ... bee ... eye ... agent ! !
sure you can ! you may even like it ... it 's a killer rush . you 'll see . hey , do n't i show you things , johnny u ?
i ca n't do this .
see ! that 's what i like about you , man ! you 're just sharp as a razor blade .
we 're wasting time .
sorry , ca n't do it , brah . he 's on the road . and where they 're going there 's no phones . damn , i hate this johnny , i really do . i hate violence . see , that 's why i need rosie . i could never make this thing work , myself . no way i could hold a knife to tyler 's throat , man ! she was my woman , once . we shared time in this world . but rosie , he 's kind of a ... mechanism . once you set him in motion , he wo n't stop . that 's his gift , a kind of ... blankness . noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . nothing i can do , unless i get there .
you call him ... right now ... and tell him to let her go .
she 'll be fine , rosie wo n't do anything . at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time , about ... let 's see ... ... six hours from now .
talk .
whoa , whoa ! ! think it through ! i 'm the only one knows where they are . just let me talk for a second .
you 're a fucking dead man --
insurance policy . now this is going to sting a bit , but it 's for your own growth , brah . press play .
what 's this ?
okay !
you first !
one thousand feet . pull the goddamn cord !
you do it ... you first !
do n't screw around man , pull it !
after you , alfonse . i insist !
you gon na pull ?
i 'll take that as a yes .
whoooaaah ! shhiiittt ! whoooaaah !
utah , you copy bruddah ?
my man !
we gon na jump or jerk off ?
then we 'll earn it together . here , take mine .
you got ta earn trust .
i did . what 's the matter ? do n't trust me ?
so , who ... uh , who packed my chute ?
it 's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer . one last speedstar .
yeah , i noticed you limping . but do n't worry about it , brah . do n't worry at all . we 're not gon na land on land !
sure , it 's a blast , but listen , i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday --
pure adrenalin , right ? ! the ultimate rush . other guys snort for it , jab a vein for it -- all you got ta do is jump .
once .
ever done this before ?
'one shot stopping ' ... good , very good . i like you , johnny . i like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . i respect that . it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . here , hold it . check out the weight .
one shot stopping .
news , last night ... those guys , the ex-presidents ... they robbed my bank yesterday . and i was just there the day before , cashing a check . see ... look . assured trust ... same place .
how you figure ?
yeah , right , vision is highly over- rated .
the only way to win out here is to surrender . you have to feel what the wave is doing , accept its energy , get in sync . just feel it all moving in the blackness ... you do n't need to see .
a flaw i 'm working on .
i 've watched you once or twice . you surf like it 's some kind of street fight . you jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . always trying to win .
i know that part . tell me something i can use , here .
football 's a man-made game . you keep score with numbers . but in this , there 's no field , no rules , no opponent . just you and the wave .
yeah , but are you crazy enough ?
i got ta be fucking crazy .
no , bells beach , australia .
so what 's the biggest ? waimea ?
only make bets i ca n't afford to lose . only way to be 100 % committed .
do n't you gamble ?
come with tyler . she knows .
where ?
gon na be some people at my house tonight . maybe you can make it .
de nada .
thanks for stepping in .
no . so i was up the beach . i saw it going down . you did n't hesitate ... they never backed you up an inch . that 's rare in this world .
you always talk like this ? you 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ?
they 're punks . nazis . their brains are wired wrong . they hurt surfing because they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . they just want to get radical . it 's mindless aggression . they 'll never get it , the spiritual side of it .
what 's their program ?
the one you decked is bunker wiess . the big one is his brother , warchild . the other two always hang . they think they 're some kinda death squad around here .
friends of yours , huh ?
not yet .
mmm . a lawyer , huh ? too bad . but at least you 're surfing now . so your life 's not over yet , right ?
two years of surgery . i missed my window . limped through law school instead .
and that 's why you never went pro ?
yeah , my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way .
something happened . you got nuked in the last quarter .
there 's nobody else here ...
well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ?
look , i do n't know anything about your dog , okay --
you sure he is n't out back ? you mind if i go take a look ?
no .
have you seen a little dog ? kind of a cockapoo lookin ' thing . about this big .
yeah ? what ?
take your hand off my shoulder right now .
three men dead . one of them a cop . how 's that sit in your gut , utah ?
caught my first tube this morning .
special agent utah , this is not some job flippin ' burgers at the drive-in . yes , the surfboard bothers me . yes , your approach to this case bothers me . and yes , you bother me . you two have produced squat in the last two weeks , during which time the ex- presidents have robbed two more banks ! ! do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me ?
the correct term is babes , sir . uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . of the social infrastructure , i mean .
what ?
babes .
a little mushy ! you think the taxpayers would like it , utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ?
a little mushy .
surf conditions okay ?
fine .
how was the beach ?
not so far .
you 're a real blue-flame special , are n't you , utah ? i do n't know why they sent you to la . must be an asshole shortage .
zero distortion , sir .
that 's right . and we nailed over a thousand of them . we did it by crunching data . good crime-scene work , good lab work , good data-base analysis . nobody had to tackle a car once . you getting the signal , special agent ?
1322 last year in la county . up 26 percent from the year before .
this is us . bank robbery . and you 're in the bank-robbery capital of the world --
i take the skin off chicken .
all the food groups ? avoiding sugar ? caffeine ? i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness . we stay off hard liquor , cigarettes ...
sir ?
eating solid breakfasts , utah ?
yes , sir .
you know less than nothing . if you even knew that you knew nothing , at least that would be something , but you do n't .
what that ?
harp , let me tell you something . i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass , and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still have n't ?
yeah , sure . why not ? you two screw-ups deserve each other . that 's why i put you together in the first place . christ pappas , you 're as bad as he is ... talk about the blind leading the blind --
look , harp . do n't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk . let me ride him in .
supervising special agent , harp . now i want you to go work the drop car , okay , angelo ? okay ?
yeah , i get it . time to play let 's dick the old guys , huh , harp ?
that 's the point , is n't it ?
cole and munoz ? i been on this case for two years .
cole and munoz . i 'm uh ... letting them run with the ball for a while .
what ? now i 'm working the drop car ? who 's handling the scene here ?
they found the drop car up on mulholland . i want you two to go work it .
nooo ! !
kid , get outta the way ! !
angelo ! do n't fire !
figured you did .
i know where they 're going .
nothing .
nothing ?
you sure ? !
they took a left at the next light !
the hell are they ? !
that place up the street has meatball sandwiches . get me two .
angelo , it 's eleven thirty .
time for lunch .
look , we handle it ourselves , for right now , okay ? we cover the bank , whatever . you and me . that way if nothing happens , or more accurately , when nothing happens ... i do n't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are .
i say we do n't call it in . under no circumstance are we to call this in .
sure . no problem . i 'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious . shit , he 'll probably call out the national guard .
i say we call it in . get some backup . but you got ta do it . harp wo n't listen to me .
no way . not yet . come on .
they 're on their way to maui .
angelo ... i 'm right this time . we can still win this one .
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man , which i always hate because it looks bad on the report .
wait , wait . then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit . load it in bodhi 's truck and take it to a public storage unit . you see ? summer 's almost over . they 're splitting . they 're gon na pick up a little traveling money tomorrow . the next day at the outside latest . i got a feeling .
yeah , or cashing a check .
cute . he was inside for about 20 minutes . the other guy , roach , waited in the truck . they were scoping it out , right ? !
did he rob it ?
bodhi , yeah . i 'm on him all day , right . he goes here , he goes there , he goes to tower records and buys come cds , he has lunch at patrick 's road house ... ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan .
this zen master surfer .
... so i started tailing him .
angelo , we got ta talk .
johnny ! uh , you , uh ... should call first , you know ? hey , where the hell were you all day ? you got ta at least call in or something . you okay ?
nice tattoo , dietz .
aw shit .
awright . get into position . i 'm rolling .
got it .
cole and munoz are going in the back door . babbit is backing me . so i want you at the side window by the hedge . you 're strictly backup , got it ?
i 'm ready to rock , angelo . where you want me ?
right here , partner .
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up ?
he 's pushing it through first thing . you better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
when did harp say they 'd have the warrant ?
remember , all bank robbers are losers , but not all losers are bank robbers .
... felony b and e , three months in juvey . better . felony assault . postgraduate work at chino . excellent . i 'm lovin ' it . what about the brother ? great ! another model citizen . these guys really fit the profile .
okay , dad .
look , if you 're gon na go leavin ' your piece and your shield in the car , you can damn well stay in sight . okay ?
thanks , buddy .
no , but there are four guys back there you might check out .
patience hotshot . patience . it 'll be subtle , if it 's here at all .
big zippo so far . how about you ?
no . but let 's do it , anyway . it 's gon na bug the shit out of harp .
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills , right ? and surfers are territorial . they stick mostly to certain breaks . if we can get some hair samples , and get a match to a certain beach , we 'd know which break the ex-presidents surf . you buyin ' this ?
guy 's the toxic avenger .
angelo , pay attention . there 's gon na be a test afterward . lab is showing traces of toxins . pcbs . heavy elements ... selenium , titanium and arsenic .
johnny , all i can say is we better come up with something real soon .
it sticks out , so i ca n't lock it . look , angelo , you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf ? this was your lame-o idea in the first place . you got ta back me up on this .
what , you could n't have just left the thing in your car ?
got it ...
i think you got ta hit them straight on !
it 's all balance , right ? and coordination . how hard can it be ?
angelo , this stuff is for little rubber people who do n't shave yet .
they 're like some kind of tribe . got their own language . you ca n't just walk up to these guys . you 've got to get out there . learn some moves . get into their head . pick up the speech .
why ca n't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned ? ask a few questions .
johnny , it 's the only way .
another month and we do n't see 'em again 'til next summer .
... four months . june to october . mmmm ... same the year before .
thanks for the tip . i needed this knowledge .
surfers use it on their boards . they rub sand into it for traction .
sex wax ? you 're not into kinky shit , are you angelo ?
the lab made three possible matches , this was one of 'em .
candle wax . car wax . mustache wax ? could be anything . guy 's waxing his mustache at the beach . gets sand in it . wipes it off with a shoe . shoe scuffs the counter .
shutup , you might learn somethin ' you 're not careful ... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over . there was a soil sample . non- specific mud traces of asphalt , oils , blah , blah ... sand and ... carnuba wax . so i became a wax expert . there 's 80 some uses for this stuff , something like five hundred products .
oh well he must be a surfer .
the fucking punks are surfers .
yeah . what 's your theory ?
yeah . that was thirty years ago anyway . l.a. 's changed a lot since then . the air got dirty and the sex got clean . so you want to nail the ex- presidents ? be a big hero ?
sorry .
you watch your fucking mouth ! mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here !
so you 're gon na coast to retirement , when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity .
forget about it , kid . they 're ghosts . let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it . see i 'm almost 55 ... so i must be senile , right ? they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public . drooling . it would look bad for the bureau , right ?
well , what 're your ideas on these guys ?
you through , mr. wizard ? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you 're at it . hell , it 's only 7:30. the night 's still young ... you can solve this case and start on another one .
the ex-presidents are the best i 've seen , kid .
surgical . look at them separate the dye packs . dick and ronny know their jobs .
reagan usually drives . stolen switch car , they leave it running at the curb , looks parked from a distance . when they run , they dump the vehicle and vanish . and i mean vanish .
smart . you burn time in the vault .
never go for the vault . they never get greedy .
they do n't go for the vault ?
yeah , they control the room well . stick strictly to the cash drawers .
good move .
welcome to sea world , kid .
punk . quarterback punk .
pappas . angelo pappas .
the shit they pull , huh ?
added to which indignity , i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner . some quarterback punk , johnny unitas or something .
fuck you , johnny utah . fuck you ! ! do n't you have a soul ? goddamn you to hell !
i work bank robbery . guys i 'm after are surfers . i needed you , at first , but not --
you tell me the fucking truth johnny ... did your parents really die in a car crash ? did they ? !
tyler , put the gun down .
jesus christ , johnny -- you 've been using me ! your jacket 's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing 's half out of the pocket ... oh god , it 's all part of some case , is n't it ?
but you look like you been in a train wreck , how 'd he just drive away ?
never saw him , was your basic hit and run .
so what 'd the other guy look like ?
you 're kneeling on my hand .
betadyne does n't hurt .
ouch .
no . i 'm sorry . i have to go . i 'll , uh ... i 'll call you later . i 'm sorry .
johnny ... what 's going on ? i do n't get it ... did i do something ?
i ... i got ta go .
warm them up .
those are cold .
you do n't have to .
i ... i do n't know . i ca n't describe what i 'm feeling .
well , usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration , like you 're doing this for a school project or something ... i do n't know , like something 's driving you . see , it 's gone . if i did n't know better i 'd say you looked almost happy .
what ?
look at you .
yeah . i just want to sit out here for a minute .
you had enough ?
come on . at least no one 's gon na see how bad you are .
i can barely do this in broad daylight .
swell 's here , johnny . bodhi always knows .
what 's goin ' on ?
i 've seen that kamikaze look , johnny . you 've got it . and bodhi can smell it a mile away . he 'll take you to the edge ... and past it . hey , bodhi .
what are you talking about ?
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . i hope you 're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi 's moonies .
yeah , he thinks he 's evolved to a higher plane of existence , or something . maybe he has . you 've seen him surf ... that frenzy . it seems like anger . it 's not . it 's the energy of lovemaking . the sea is the woman in his life . she 's his only true lover .
sure , he 's `` the bodhisattva '' .
we went out for about five minutes ... which is four minutes longer than most of them . but you ca n't hold it against him , he 's ... different .
meaning you were expendable .
people are expendable to bodhi .
oh , oh . that sounds personal .
catch of the day .
who 's the girl ?
he rents it for the summer . bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . most a these guys ca n't keep a job . when the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .
nice place .
sure .
stop here . do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it ?
tomorrow , 6 am . here . if you 're a minute late i 'm gone . and stud ... i did n't take you to raise . i can show you a few things but after that you 're on your own . that 'll be four fifty .
i came out here from ohio a month ago . never saw the ocean before . i did n't think it would effect me so much . like i 'm drawn to it , or something . i want to do what you do . it 's the truth .
wait , so i 'm a big hero to my folks , right ? but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals . and i had n't been living my own life . so i wanted something for myself . something that maybe did n't make any sense . you know what i mean ?
this gon na take long ?
no , no . see , all my life i 've done things for other people . in high school i played football because my old man expected me to . then my parents always figured i 'd go to law school , so i did . football scholarship . graduated phi beta kappa --
what is it ? you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing ? this is a line , right ?
well , i 'm just gon na go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck .
i can see that . but forget it . stick to tennis , or whatever you 're good at . miniature golf . here , your number 's 37 .
i 'm serious .
gim me a break . one shrimp and fries to go ! anything to drink ?
i need you to teach me .
i mean , what do you want ? what are you doing hanging around here .
shrimp and fries .
what do you want ?
wait ! jesus christ ! you 're fucking crazy , you know that ? you go in there you 're gon na eat it on the rocks . here , follow me .
bye .
i 'm telling you so when you look back on this moment , you can think ... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever ... when i could have easily helped him .
who cares !
my name 's johnny utah !
carefully , tough guy . very carefully .
hey ! uh , how do i get back in ?
yeah , you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it , a big strong stud like you should n't have any problem . right ? ! well you figured wrong , dork !
well , i saw you and --
something ... in the trees ...
billy ... what the hell 's wrong with you ?
what about the rest of hopper 's men ?
i do n't believe he did , sir . i could n't find a single track . just does n't make sense .
i ca n't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush .
strange , major . there was a firefight . shooting in all directions .
six others , u.s. issue jungle boots . they came in from the north , then followed the guerrillas .
what do you mean ?
major , looks like there were ten , maybe twelve guerrillas . looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper . then a different set of track , over there .
right behind you .
i 'll see you there .
you know you ca n't win this one .
guess i 've picked up some bad habits from you , dutch . now do n't argue with me , you know i 'm right . get to that chopper and hold it for us . we 'll be along .
this is n't your style , dillon .
no way , dutch . i 'm going . you get these people and get the hell out of here .
now what , dutch . you going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
he 'll be looking for the trip wires . if we 're lucky , he wo n't see this .
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles , at most ! we 're almost home . but the chopper wo n't wait .
we 're not going .
what are you talking about ? we 'll be out of here in ten minutes .
we 're going to need everyone .
what the hell do you think you 're doing ?
no more games .
you 're wastin ' your time .
bullshit . you 're just like the rest of us .
i can accept that , it comes with the job .
expendable assets , dillon . seems langley is never around when you need them .
we 're still too far in , they wo n't risk coming in for us .
the wound all fused , cauterized ... what the hell did this ?
blain ... ... just like the others ... no powder burns , no shrapnel .
we take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . no prisoners , dillon .
she 's too valuable . she 's got to know their whole network . the whole set up . we take her with us .
we 've been lookin ' for this place for months . the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down . hopper was sent in to get my men . he was just doing his job . when he disappeared i had to clean this up , i had to stop there bastards . we were so close , we could n't quit . we could n't sleep through this one . i needed you , dutch , ca n't you see that ?
what story did you give to davis ?
because i told you , you 're the best . i knew you could do it but i could n't get you in here without a cover story .
why us ?
that 's right , i set you up . you 're a veteran at this , dutch , i had to .
it was all bullshit . all of it . from the start ... you set us up , got us in here to do your dirty work .
well somebody sent them .
jesus ... this is inhuman . uh ... i was n't told of any operations in this area . they should n't have been here .
i knew this man . green berets , out of fort bragg . what the hell were they doing in here ? you got any answers for this , dillon ?
probably another rebel patrol . they operate in here all the time .
mean anything to you ?
they 're getting better equipped every day .
billy 's on it . heat seeker . pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys .
you never were all that smart ... let 's go ! ! !
you do n't know how much i missed this , dutch ! ! ! once you get this in your blood , you never get it out ! ! !
this gets better by the minute .
no such thing , old buddy . it 's a one way ticket . once we cross that border , we 're on our own .
who 's our back-up on this ?
our rendezvous points and radio freqs . are indicated and fixed . awacs contact on four hour intervals .
go on .
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . they 're about to get squeezed . we ca n't let that happen . i needed someone who could get the job done , quick and quiet ... no screw-ups . i needed the best . the best . so , i pulled a few strings at the state department ... and here we are .
was n't my style . we 're a rescue unit , not assassins . this must be good . big shot from the cia , leaves his desk to come back to the bush . what 's so important ?
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya .
like the old days , dillon .
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something . blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat . beautiful .
you never did know when to quit .
no way , old buddy .
you 've been pushing too many pencils , dillon . had enough ?
we both got scores to settle .
... right , i got a score to settle for the bro ...
take a position over there . i 'll work around towards you . when i flush him , you nail him ...
those eyes ... disappeared . but i know one thing , major ... ... i drew down and fired right at it . capped-off two hundred rounds and then the mini-gun ; the full pack . nothin ' ... nothin ' on this earth could have lived ... not at that range .
what , sergeant ?
do n't know , only saw one of 'em . camouflaged . he was there ... ... those fucking eyes ...
anytime .
thanks .
the best friend i ever had .
i 'm sorry , bull . it 's never easy . he was a good soldier .
thank you , sergeant .
we 've got most of the flares , frags . and two claymores just outside . nothin 's comin ' close to here without trippin ' on somethin ' .
i 'll take him .
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back . we 'll bury him in the morning .
i saw it .
you saw what ?
ca n't say , major ... been squirrely all mornin ' ... fuckin ' weird ... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good ... smells things that ai n't there .
what 's got billy so spooked ?
we found 'em both , dead . and the gear from the chopper . if they 're central american , i 'm a fuckin ' chinaman . by the looks of 'em , i 'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia . another thing , major , we were lucky ... couple of those guys we waxed are russians , military advisors by the look of it . something big was about to happen here .
any sign of the hostages ?
someone else will be going in with you .
what 's that , general ?
you lift off in three hours . there 's one other thing .
we figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . after that , there 's not much hope . we want a rescue operation mounted tonight . that does n't give you much time .
what have you got in mind , general .
that 's the problem . apparently they strayed off course . we 're certain they 've been captured by the guerrillas .
that 's over the border , general .
it 's been a long time , general .
you 're looking well , dutch .
why did n't he try to kill one of us last night ?
he knows our defenses .
how could anyone get through this , carry blain out , right under our noses without leavin ' a trace ?
there 's no sign of it .
where the hell is his body ?
i think it 's hawkins .
what in god 's name ... ?
i ca n't tell .
hawkins ?
major , you 'd better take a look at this .
same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper ... followed by men with american equipment ...
what 's he got ?
i do n't think that was any ordinary army taxi ...
mmmnnn ... ?
there 's something else , major ...
took 'em out with a heat seeker .
they never are , dear .
he 's not really my uncle .
your uncle will like this .
philip ! we 'll need shoes !
i dunno . do thigh high , leather boots go with a cocktail dress ?
you 'll want a cocktail dress then . turn . you have a beautiful figure . a little too out in the open but simply lovely . size six ? do you need shoes ?
well ... i might be going out to dinner .
no wonder . for starts , you should know that hot pants are < u > horrid < /u > , even when you do have the legs to carry them off . what are your plans while you 're in town ?
georgia .
i do . i take it all very personally . very nice meeting you , vivian .
do what you have to do . i do n't take it personally .
i do n't think so . you should know we 're going to fight you with every resource we have .
we can reach an understanding on this .
but i do know . i also know your lines of credit are over-extended . if i do n't buy your company , someone else will ... ah , the escargot .
there 's no way you could know that .
you 're not getting any navy contracts .
we 're on the verge of closing a large navy contract . double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares . we would give you a promissory note ...
twenty-five percent .
mr. harris , we know you 've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock . we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share .
i 'd like to find out . you do n't know anything about me either . that 's why people have lunch .
you do n't know anything about me .
i see . well . maybe that means you 'd have lunch with me sometime then .
it 's ... it 's not like that .
hope to be ?
no .
hey , big guy , you getting tired , yet ? i am . this is vivian . you two been together long ? you and edward ?
thunder 's a horse . come on .
please , we hardly know each other .
let 's not talk about it , it 's too depressing . come on , i 'll show you thunder .
huh ? oh ... yeah . s'okay ? uhm ... how 're ... business things going .
i like your hat .
who indeed ...
who are you going after next , sir ?
mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker . it 's finished . you 've won .
what ?
congratulations , sir .
i talked to some developers about the land .
you what ?
the real estate possibilities are endless . most of the yard we 'll just level . i talked to a couple of developers , under the table , of course , and they said --
not with those smokestacks it 's not .
storage , i think .
what 's that long building over there ?
you 're very right . i think the best thing we could all do is go home .
you 'd be initiating a financial battle you 'd ultimately lose , mr. harris .
this time i imagine you would , yes . hmm ... with all this in mind , mr. kross , i ca n't logically make a formal bid on your company , can i ?
quiet . would i get the loans ?
i suppose you 'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently do n't seem aware of , would n't you ? the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours , you 'd certainly find out about that .
i ... i do n't know . there ... there was n't time ...
how ?
i ... i would take advantage of it .
if you had a ... reprieve , what would do ?
yes .
stop . for just a moment . mr. kross , i 'd like to ask you a few questions < u > before < /u > you sign . you realize that you 're a target . if you were n't mine , you 'd be someone elses , correct ?
you 're making the right decision , sir .
of course , yes . after the < u > expected < /u > filing period is over , i 'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid .
< u > expected < /u > ... offer .
yes . i 'm here to tell you that i 've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .
not bad for a man who has n't slept in four nights . i 'll get used to it .
how are you , mr. kross .
mr. harris .
it is < u > not < /u > your company . it 's a public company . and i < u > am < /u > going to acquire it . either i buy from the other stock holders , or i buy from you .
i do n't question the legality of what you do . it 's your morality that makes me sick . i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you .
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal .
i know all about you , mr. harris . when you buy companies , they have a way of disappearing . even the pension funds are stripped clean . the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces , widows were left without their retirement checks .
no . what i have is a lot of money .
you 've got a lot of nerve .
mr. kross , i 'm not here to sell you my stock . on the contrary , i 'm here to buy yours .
to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid . but your company does n't have enough capital right now to buy anything .
what would it take to buy our stock back ? name your price .
it 's not your fault . you 're right . kit 's right . but i want the fairy tale .
vivian ...
i did n't think so .
i do . i do want to . that 's why i 'm leaving . that 's what you given me , see ? i know what i want now . i want a guy like you for real . not because you buy me things and give me money . the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand . you gon na give me that ?
stay with me tonight . not because you 're being paid to . stay with me because you want to .
aw , do n't ... no ...
i 'm leaving . do n't ya see ? if i stay with you like you want me to , there 'll always be some guy , your friends eve , treatin ' me like that ... thinkin ' they 're allowed to . what are you gon na do , fight 'm all ? no . i 'll take my money now , please .
you 're packing .
it felt good .
it was good .
i got tired of hating my father .
it was a business decision .
right . you 're quite the sir galahad today , are n't ya ' ? i heard what you did with kross .
not all men hit . and no one is going to hit you anymore .
why do guys always know how to hit a woman ? right across the cheek , wham , so it feels like your eye is gon na explode . what do they do , take you all aside in high school and show you how ? it pisses me off !
it 's what i do for a living . it 's how i make money .
it 's all just business to you . him . me . your life . everything 's business .
yes . the man made a business decision .
business .
it 's not your concern . it 's ... business , that 's all .
right .
vivian , i want you to listen to me . the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son 's future , if he cooperated .
last time i saw him he was this strong guy . now he 's beaten . and you < u > liked him < /u > .
what do you mean ?
what did you do to him ?
you just did .
i 've never treated you like a whore .
i know . hey , do n't mind me . i 'm being stupid . i 'll think about it , okay ? it 's a real good offer for a whore .
vivian , life 's not a fairy tale .
when i was a little girl , my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad , which was pretty often . i 'd stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen . then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up . rescue me from the tower , and then we 'd ride off ... but never , ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say , `` come on baby , i 'll put you up in a great condo . ''
vivian , i 've thought about this a lot . this is the best solution .
i 'm sorry . that 's very sweet , edward , and i know you mean it ...
it would n't be like that . i want to get you off the street . you 'll have a different kind of life . what 's wrong with that ?
what else ? you gon na leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town ?
i have to go to new york tomorrow .
yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take .
one more night and you 're finally rid of me .
yes . i 've never enjoyed it more . thank you .
did you ?
i know . i 'm glad .
i more than liked it .
if you 'd gone on about how much you liked it , i 'm not sure i 'd have believed you .
vivian , do n't be afraid of what you do n't know . that 's the fun of it .
but do n't they have it in english ?
i 'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you . but you 'll be surprised how much you understand . the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words .
if it 's in italian , how will i know what they 're saying ?
what happened to him ?
you mean , besides elvis ? i 'm a human being . sure . once . first time i ever ran away from home , i got as far as atlanta . i met this boy . he 'd been with his parents on their way to chicago . they stopped at a gas station . he went to the john . when he came back they 'd split . we sorta started looking out for each other . aw , he was sweet . and boy , was he good looking , y'know , dark hair and eyes . the chicken hawks were on him all the time . he hated that . sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things . the two of us getting married someday . having kids . stupid stuff .
vivian . i 'm paying you to be you . be you . have you ? ever been in love with anyone ?
sorry . you 're not paying me to ask you question like that .
i 'm glad you like it . now be quiet , i 've really got to read these .
i 've never been on a plane before .
the opera .
huh ?
to meet some friends . rudolpho , a poet ... benoit , a landlord ... mimi , a flower maker ...
where are you taking me ! ?
you do n't want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine , do you ? i do n't .
i 'll guard them and you with my life .
what if someone tries to steal it ?
you wo n't .
what if i lose it ?
shush . of course you can .
edward , i ca n't .
i do n't want you to get too excited ... these are on loan ... however ...
what 's that ?
hmm ... let 's see ... no , there 's something missing .
do i look okay ?
i really am sorry .
i 'm not hurt . it does n't hurt you when somebody pisses on you , it just pissed you off .
vivian ... i 'm sorry . i was n't prepared for questions about us . it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did . i should have known that it would hurt you .
i 'll call you a cab . if you want the clothes , pack them up .
fuck off .
fine . i 'm only here a couple of more days and i 'm not going to spend them fighting with you .
pay me ! before i pick up this chair and smash your face in .
vivian ...
well , it 's true . just pay me what you owe me and i 'm gone .
your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason i 'm with you is for the money .
can we talk about this ? can you just try to calm down ?
i want my fucking money . i 'm getting out of here . i do n't want anything more to do with you .
what was i supposed to do ? i told the truth . why should the truth upset you ? it 's not as if you 're from a convent .
stuckey ! he wants an `` appointment '' with me after you leave . you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own ?
would you please calm down . tell me what happened .
i 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but i 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
clean the slut up , take her out , huh ? ! what are you trying to prove ! ? i 'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends !
vivian , what the --
you asshole ! i ca n't believe what a -- !
ready to stomp sod ?
i thought i was the pro . these women make me feel like an amateur .
i 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
edward , these women here , i do n't think any of 'm like the guys they 're with . they 're just into it for the money .
shall we mingle ?
you could freeze ice on his wife 's ass . she anything like your ex ?
he 's good at what he does .
real genuine guy .
you did .
i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard .
what id we run into someone i know ?
i think it 's exciting .
you 're really pushing it , bringing me here .
he died a long time ago .
you still mad at 'm ?
not much to tell . i went to public school . went to university on scholarship . went to work for an investment firm . in eight years i owned it . my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after . i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . one of the pieces was him .
keep talkin ' . i like hearin ' .
easier than learning how to be poor . my father 's family was wealthy . when i was young there were cars and houses , private schools , nannies . but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman . and he took his money with him .
seems like it . i guess it 's easy to get used to , huh ?
no .
you always been rich ?
dinner can wait .
what about dinner ?
please .
wait till you see what i have on underneath .
thank you . i would . nice .
i thought maybe you 'd like dinner .
come with me ?
good .
okay .
vivian , you belong wherever you are . i do n't care how you were dressed , they were the ones who were wrong , not you .
i had a little problem in one store . i was n't dressed right . i do n't know what to say . i do n't belong there . maybe i 'll just go back to bridget . she was cool .
was someone rude to you ?
well , you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you ? it works .
why not ?
i was n't as much fun as i thought it was going to be .
i still do n't understand why you only bought one dress .
uh-uh . no work .
i have work to do .
yeah , it 's this box , it has pictures , sound . you do n't have to use your brain at all .
television ?
know what we 're gon na do in a little while then ? we 're gon na call domino 's and have 'm deliver a bigass pizza . we 're gon na eat it in bed . we 're gon na veg ' out and watch television .
we 're the exactly the same ! kit keeps telling me do n't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that 's why no kissing -- it 's too personal . the key is like you 're saying , stay numb , do n't get involved -- when i 'm with a guy , i 'm a robot , i just do it . except with you . at your price i give my all ...
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant . it 's business . there 's no emotion involved in business ... if you want to survive .
you liked the guy , though .
upset . no . i never get upset about business .
you 're upset , huh ?
some game . screwin ' some poor slob out of his retirement .
and that 's the way the game is played .
you 're forgiven .
i 'm sorry .
oooh !
i thought i told you not to answer the phone .
hello ?
thank you < u > very much < /u > .
... all right . i 'll meet you in the lobby . but only cause you 're paying me to .
i think you 'll approve .
any good ?
the rex .
go by yourself then . where you taking me anyway ?
this is n't a date .
no , i do n't `` got it '' . even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they 're taking you on a date .
let 's hope so . you 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . i 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . got it ?
it 's very tasteful . i think you 'll especially like the zipper in the crotch . i 'm -- joking .
just one ? christ ... i hope it 's appropriate .
i got a dress , yeah .
did you buy some clothes ?
tsk , believe me , this will be the last time .
never answer the phone . ever .
three thousand for five days . and vivian , i will let you go .
look butthead , i 'll treat you so nice you 'll never want to let me go , okay ?
i 'm not just talking about sex .
holy shit .
done .
three .
all right , two thousand .
but you want days too .
vivian , may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500 .
four thousand .
five full nights ... days too ?
of course . how much ?
it 'd cost you .
i 'm in town until saturday .
what ?
all right . how much for the week ?
do n't drown .
i fucked the debate team in high school . tsk . i had a grampa . he liked ties on sundays . you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it ?
where 'd you learn to do this ?
there , see ? now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot .
not ... quite .
sorta like stealing cars and selling 'm for parts , huh ?
assets are anything of value a company owns . sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole . by selling them off , i make a profit .
c'mon , i might buy a company some day .
vivian --
what are assets ?
by breaking up a company 's assets --
what ? why ?
i sell them .
so what a ya do with the companies once you buy 'm ?
... dollars ?
the one i 'm buying this week will cost around 150 million .
no shit . they expensive ?
i buy companies .
`` occupational hazard '' .
no ? why 's that ?
i like guys if that 's what you 're asking . not that i trust 'm .
do you ever ... enjoy it ?
i 'd say you give a good dollar value .
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks .
mmm , i could tell .
oooh , baby , you were the best . i was beside myself .
i took the couch . i had some work to do . about last night ...
where 'd you go ?
occupational hazard ?
yeah . too good . i forgot where i was .
did you sleep well ?
no hurry . would you like some breakfast ?
you did n't wake me . i 'll be out of here in a minute .
good morning .
if i want you to turn me on i 'll pay < u > you < /u > three hundred . just lay back and let me drive .
what do you like ?
yes ...
just a romantic , that 's you .
you really are a very beautiful girl .
vivian ... the meter 's running ... cooperate .
jesus , you act like you 're seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club .
because they bring out the flavor of the champagne .
why ?
try a strawberry .
oooh , thank god .
it 's a very good year .
they should be . they 're both good at it .
where are they ? shopping together ?
tsk . excuse me , i did n't think he had change for a hundred .
i think he wanted you to tip him .
i 've known a lot of everybody .
sounds like you 've known a lot of lawyers .
i dunno ... you have that sharp , useless look .
and why do you say that ?
let me guess , you 're a ... lawyer .
uh-huh .
right . so ! in town on business ?
let 's talk some more first .
fair enough .
well , the meter 's running , it 's your money . speaking of which , cash 'll do . in advance .
always .
do you plan everything ?
want to know something ? i do n't quite know . i had n't planned this .
-- and a bowl of strawberries . thank you .
can i have some chips ?
send up a bottle of crystal champagne .
diet coke .
room service . what do you drink ?
exactly .
off the boulevard .
every place has hookers , but if this hotel has hookers , they do n't look like they 're ...
you mean they do n't have hookers .
you may feel more comfortable . this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour .
why ?
my raincoat 's in the back . put it on .
then let 's go . it 's worth 300 just so i do n't have to drive .
better believe it .
you know how to drive a stick ?
what ?
get in . this side .
edward ... you got it !
edward . my name is edward .
what 's your name , lover .
fine .
three hundred .
you could n't afford it .
vivian , how much to put up with me for the entire night ?
no , but it 's getting there .
neither do i. a hundred bucks an hour though . that 's pretty stiff .
i never joke about money .
you 're joking .
for an hour .
for the whole night ?
company would cost you ... a hundred dollars .
what do you charge for company , vivian ?
you do n't know habits , you think this is ugly .
ugly habit , biting your nails .
sorry . if i did , i did n't mean to .
if you 're making fun of me , i do n't like it .
very good . you ought to have that printed up on your business card .
tell me about it . l.a. is suffering from a wacko epidemic . and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been . i mean , i use condoms . always . and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic . not only am i better in the sack than an amateur , i 'm probably safer .
must be dangerous . hooking .
day jobs , yeah . i 've tried them . turn right .
so do day jobs .
it pays .
you like being a hooker , vivian ?
what do you want it to be ? vivian , my name 's vivian .
what 's your name ?
yeah , i peed in the fountain there once . give me a break .
regent beverly wilshire . i bet you know it .
okay , what < u > ho < /u > tel ?
< u > ho < /u > tel .
what motel you staying at ?
new york .

if you can figure it out , be my guest .
mind if i turn on some heat ?
not exactly .
stolen ?
no .
nice car . yours ?
sit-and-spin . alright ... why not ?
sit ... and spin .
why do n't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart ?
the price just went up to ten .
that 's ridiculous .
sure . for five bucks .
good . can you tell me how to get to beverly hills ?
actually , i 'm a movie star out for a walk .
no , you look like a hooker .
great . what do i look like a tourguide ?
yes .
what ? you gon na tell me you 're lost ?
uh , no . how do i get to beverly hills ?
you looking ' for some company ?
what 's that ?
hey sugar , you lookin ' for a date ?
afternoon .
good afternoon , mr. harris .
thank you .
mr. harris , a guest of yours , is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly . the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge .
the young lady staying in your room ?
my what ?
i have a message for you from your `` niece '' , sir .
of course , yes . if you 'll excuse me just a moment --
barnard thomas , manager of the hotel .
yes .
all this because of that whore !
and i do n't like what we 've become . i 'll cover any losses you have on this one . now get out , you asshole !
edward , we 've been together ten years .
i think i broke my hand . you 're fired .
you broke my nose .
have a good day , gentlemen .
what ! ?
have you lost your mind ?
i suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ?
oh , my god ... edward , no !
let him answer .
i do n't think there 's any sense in --
we 'll be there . listen , if he 's really caving in , we 'll go from there down to the office . i want him to commit his stock to us this morning .
give me twenty minutes .
he would n't say . edward ... i think we got him . his nuts are on the block and < u > we got him < /u > . you there ?
why ?
i had to call . i jus got off the phone with james kross . get this . he wants to see you . today .
i 'm up .
did i wake you ?
goodbye , bill .
promise me you 'll read those contracts by then .
bill ? stop panicking . kross is n't going anywhere and i do n't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down . i 'll be in the office tomorrow .
this is no time to disappear . we 're in too far .
christ , bill , she 's not a spy , she 's a hooker . i picked her up off hollywood boulevard .
industrial espionage is not ridiculous . edward , how do you know she has n't attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information ?
you 're being ridiculous .
so now they 're best friends ? edward , this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we 're trying to buy . it 's too convenient .
she met him at dinner last night ... i like this tie .
hear me out . i 've known you a long time . i see a difference in you this week . like that tie . i 'm suddenly wondering if this girl 's not the difference . especially when i see her talking with david kross .
why do you want to know ?
sales , really ? that 's great . what does she sell ?
vivian 's in sales .
doing what ?
yes ...
and you just happened to run into her . great . what 's she do ? she work ?
the night i left your house , i was lost . i was looking for directions .
come on , you can tell me . i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this .
we just did .
fill me in on this . how 'd you and vivian meet ?
bill stuckey , vivian . my wife , elizabeth .
bill , i 'd like you to meet vivian .
and some of it 's mine . edward , his jugular 's exposed .
come on , bill , do n't talk to me about how much money 's involved . it 's my money .
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week ? first , you go soft on the pension funds . now , you 're giving him the chance to get away ? as of two minutes ago , you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
do it .
but , edward ...
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now .
we 're letting them slide ?
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise .
our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds . there 's another forty million there . we can bleed 'm dry .
someone 's loaning it to him . get on it right away .
goddamit ! where is he getting the money to fight ?
no one you know .
eight o'clock . kross is bringing his son . very bright kid , watch yourself with him . who 's this girl you 're taking ?
what time 's diner tonight ?
we do n't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . besides ... you 've already impressed everyone you need to , have n't you ?
what ! ?
i know a lot of nice girls .
i 'm here .
edward , did you hear me ?
i 'll bring it back .
oh , god , what ?
bill , we 're businessmen , not the damn mafia . i 'll see you in the office . by the way , about your car ...
you should n't go alone . he might claim that you tried to black mail him .
i 'll see him alone . everyone knows you 're my muscle . we 'll make it social . tell kross i 'll meet him for dinner . tonight if you can arrange it .
edward , if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal .
i want to .
yes ! and you do n't even know where you 're going !
love this car ! is it new ?
no .
cynthia 's not coming ?
really ? some high class gold digger who speaks french better than i do ? no , thank you . i just got off the phone with one .
listen , there 're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you ...
apologize to elizabeth for me .
at least stay for a drink . this party 's for you .
give me your car keys , will you , i 'm going back to my hotel .
what 's up , where you going ?
i 'm gon na pay you back next time i see ya , babe . just wait , i 'm gon na do something real nice for you some day .
i want to . for food , got it ? eat something before the wind blows you away .
no . you took care of rent , that 's enough .
cool your jets a second . here 's some money .
yeah . well ... i got ta split . goodbye 's make me crazy .

and leave all this ? not in a million .

so whatta ' you going to do in san francisco ?
wow , are you in deep shit . you know he 'll break your heart .
i do n't care about bucks . i might love this guy .

i pray for that .
he wants to set me up in a place , give me some money .
dummy .
it was great .
oh , my god , you mean it was good ?
i know . i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real .
honey , you 're not supposed to do that .
i kissed him , kit . on the mouth .
where do you fit ?
you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you ?
what do you know ? you look < u > good < /u > . all dressed up . you clean up real nice . you sure do n't fit in down on the boulevard , lookin ' like you do . not that you ever did anyway .
yeah ... i know what you mean .
everybody keeps starin ' at me .
kit ...
yeah . i just got it .
kit , i left that money for you days ago .
carlos . i still owe him two hundred bucks ...
who did you think ?
was that you ?
yes , i 'm glad you 're clean but i 've been calling and calling .

three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes . now listen , i 'm gon na leave an envelope for you at the front desk . give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent . spend it on drugs and i 'll pull your hair out .
i 'm sorry , viv ' . carlos has been on my back . did you get the money up front like i taught ya ' ?
he ... he just does .
why 'd he want you ?
kit , listen , the guy last night , the one in the ferrari , i 'm at this hotel , the regent beverly wilshire , it 's this absolutely unbelievable place and he 's hired me for a whole week and kit , listen , he 's paying me three thousand bucks ! we can get out of the apartment . we can get out of this town . we can do anything ! kit ? hey , you there ?
i was asleep . you woke me . you okay ?
kit ! where 've you been ?

he 's not gon na want us .
hey , hey -- there 's a rent .
that crack is burning a hole in your pocket . there is n't even milk in the fridge . the rent 's due . now come on --
i ca n't handle this tonight . i 'm going home .
forget it . we work for it . we keep it .
maybe we should get a pimp . carlos likes you and --
looks slow tonight .
okay . i 'm sorry i said your dream was stupid .
no , let 's go to work . okay ?
i will . i 'm trying . meanwhile i got some crack left , you wan na get high ?
i thought you were giving up that drug shit .
do n't be mad at me . i 'll pay you back . i promise .
i just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster . i wonder how much she made tonight ?
viv ... do n't be stupid . we 're whores .
we worked for that money . we were gon na put together enough to get out of that dump we live in , get off this street .
i bet . that was our rent !
carlos had some great rock .
hi , viv . carlos , you know my roommate , viv .

kit give me nothin ' .
do n't give me that . kit gave it to you yesterday , cash .

yeah , what ?
thanks ! consuelo , are all rich people so lazy they ca n't do this on their own ?
i leave extras , miss .
oooh , i love those .
i also place las chocolates on the pillow .
is that all ? you just fold back the bedspread ?
okay .
< u > housekeeping < /u > . i come to turn down the bed .
what ?
housekeeping . i come to turn down the bed . 5:00 , i turn down the bed .
certain ladies make that very easy ... vivian . john , call a limousine for our guest , please . have it take her anywhere she wishes to go . bill the hotel . see you again sometime soon .
come on , barney , you and me live in the real world . you do n't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady , mr. thomas .
you 're not accompanying him to new york ?
yeah , well , i check out today .
mr. harris does n't check out until tomorrow .
look i just wanted to say goodbye .
miss vivian .
hi , barney !
i 'd send them up , but sadly , i do n't trust the young lady to find you on her own .
me ?
barnard thomas here . miss vivian , i wonder if you might come down to the front desk . there 's someone here to see you .
professionally ?
miss vivian ... there 's a salon here in the hotel . instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners , why do n't you just have your hair done instead ?
maybe i 'll just order a burger , barney , that way i can eat with my hands .
miss vivian --
steak spoon !
then you would use your --
i like steak .
then you use your < u > soup spoon < /u > .
but what if they serve soup ?
they will serve salad .
what if they serve soup ?
actually , some of the richest people i know have the worst manners . of course , mr. harris , being of old money , knows his way around a table . all right now , pay attention please . salad fork .
hmmm ... i vonder vich .
either you 're european or badly brought up .
but i always eat like this .
in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen . first , as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand .
okay . thanks , barney . you 're the best .
you 'll like it fine .
will i like it ?
i think you 'll find it normal enough .
yeah , mine too . is it like , y'know , normal ?
it 's a bit beyond my ... range , shall we say .
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner . the rex . ever been there ?
what is it , miss vivian ?
they were real nice to me there . they treated me , y'know ... nice . thanks , barney .
that 's all right . i 'm sure they 're quite lovely .
i did n't want to get it messed . i got shoes too . wan na see ?
i rather hoped you 'd be wearing it .
i got a dress .
of course . naturally when mr. harris leaves , i wo n't see you in this hotel again .
niece ?
miss vivian ... things that go on in other hotels do n't happen at the regent beverly wilshire .
vivian .
what 's your name ?
i ... edward ...
and who is that ?
i 'm -- i 'm with a friend .
you 're a guest here ?
i 'm just going to my room .
i was in here yesterday .
no , i 'm sorry , i do n't .
do you remember me ?
yes ?
'scume me .
would you like to try it on ?
i do n't think we have anything for you here . you 're obviously in the wrong place .
i 'm going to spend < u > money < /u > .
excuse me ?
what is with you ?
it 's very expensive .
i did n't ask if it would fit . i asked how much it was .
i do n't think it would fit you .
you have beautiful things . how much is this ?
yes ...
yes . something ... conservative .
are you looking for something in particular ?
i 'm just looking , thanks .
may i help you ?
do n't worry . i 'll pay for it . what a you charge ? huh ? twenty , thirty , fifty bucks , < u > maybe < /u > ? are you a fifty dollar whore ?
get out !
aw , come on , bill . it 's just business .
i bet . a lousy whore and you 're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal .
i think it 's great .
do you want to know what he did ? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did ? he handed the whole thing back to kross ! on a silver platter . for no reason ! what was he thinking , i mean , what was going through his goddam head ? why ? what was all that benevolent crap ? what are we going to become , a philanthropic foundation ? i 'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities .
i just might do that .
yeah . sure . why not . call me at the regent beverly wilshire .
it 's okay . edward told me . your secret 's safe with me .
what ?
all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard .
yeah . thanks .
having a good time , vivian ?
you survived the fire swamp . you must be very brave ... ... but nobody withstands the machine . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 69 .
you do n't believe me ?
so it 's to be torture .
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they 're broken .
then why bother curing me ?
till they kill you . yeah .
then i 'm here till i die ?
do n't even think -- -- do n't even think about trying to escape . the chains are far too thick . and do n't dream of being rescued either . the only way in is secret . and only the prince , the count , and i know how to get in and out .
then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
i killed him myself .
i do not marry tonight .
brides often are , i 'm told .
should i be ?
you do n't seem excited , my little muffin .
why not ? you ca n't hurt me . westley and i are joined by the bonds of love . and you can not track that . not with a thousand bloodhounds . and you can not break it . not with a thousand swords . and when i say you are a coward , that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .
i-would-not-say-such things-if- iwere-you-
yes , i am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .
you 're a silly girl .
you never sent the ships . do n't bother lying . it does n't matter . westley will come for me anyway .
yes . yes , of course . naturally , not those four .
every ship but the four you sent .
every ship but your four fastest , you mean .
ah ! my dulcet darling . tonight we marry . tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon .
of course .
he will come for me .
i suggest a deal . you write four copies of a letter . i 'll send my four fastest ships . one in each direction . the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year . we 'll run up the white flag and deliver your message . if westley wants you , bless you both . if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide . are we agreed ?
my westley will always come for me .
i swear it will be done .
he is a sailor on the pirate ship `` revenge . '' promise to return him to his ship .
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again .
if we surrender , and i return with you , will you promise not to hurt this man ?
oh , my sweet westley ; what have i done ?
... as ... you ... wish ...
you mocked me once , never do it again -- i died that day !
faithfulness he talked of , madam . your enduring faithfulness . now , tell me truly . when you found out he was gone , did you get engaged to your prince that same hour , or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead ?
and what am i ?
i asked him what was so important for him . `` true love , '' he replied . and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness . i can only assume he meant you . you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are .
he died well , that should please you . no bribe attempts or blubbering . he simply said , `` please . please , i need to live . '' it was the `` please '' that caught my memory . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 53 .
nothing you can say will upset me .
does it bother you to hear ?
life is pain , highness . anyone who says differently is selling something . i remember this farm boy of yours , i think . this would be , what , five years ago ?
you mock my pain !
i ca n't afford to make exceptions . once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft , people begin to disobey you , and then it 's nothing but work , work , work , all the time .
on the high seas , your ship attacked , and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners .
hardly complimentary , your highness . why loose your venom on me ?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces .
with pride . what can i do for you ?
you 're the dread pirate roberts ; admit it .
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything .
rest , highness .
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream .
`` are not capable of love '' is what you mean .
he knows i do not love him .
you admit to me you do not love your fiance ?
i never said he was my dearest love . and yes , he will save me . that i know .
you think your dearest love will save you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 50 .
i was giving you a chance . no matter where you take me ... there 's no greater hunter than prince humperdinck . he could track a falcon on a cloudy day . he can find you
and what is that worth , the promise of a woman ? you 're very funny , highness .
if you 'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you 'll get it , i promise you ...
catch your breath .
they were both poisoned . i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder .
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned .
i am no one to be trifled with , that is all you ever need know .
who are you ?
then you 're not married -- if you did n't say it , you did n't do it -- would n't you agree , your highness ?
well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
did you say , `` i do '' ?
but it did . i was there . this old man said , `` man and wife . ''
it never happened . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 117 .
what ?
it never happened .
i got married . i did n't want to . it all happened so fast .
what hideous sin have you committed lately ?
oh , westley , will you ever forgive me ?
gently ! !
at a time like this that 's all you can think to say ? `` gently ? ''
gently .
oh , westley , darling . westley , why wo n't you hold me ?
now , was that so terrible ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 64 .
we did it .
rodents of unusual size ? i do n't think they exist ...
westley , what about the r.o.u.s . 's ?
i mean , what are the three terrors of the fire swamp ? one , the flame spurts . no problem . there 's a popping sound preceding each , we can avoid that . two , the lightning sand . but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like , so in the future we can avoid that too .
no . no . we have already succeeded .
we 'll never succeed -- we may as well die here .
what ? -- go on --
finally , roberts decided something . he said , `` all right , westley , i 've never had a valet . you can try it for tonight . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' three years he said that . `` good night , westley . good work . sleep well . i 'll most likely kill you in the morning . '' it was a fine time for me . i was learning to fence , to fight , anything anyone would teach me . and roberts and i eventually became friends . and then it happened .
i myself am often surprised at life 's little quirks . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 59 .
but how is that possible , since he 's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ?
this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts ' ship `` revenge '' is anchored at the far end . and i , as you know , am roberts .
you ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 58 .
singed a bit , were you ?
nonsense -- you 're only saying that because no one ever has . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 57 .
we 'll never survive .
there will never be a need .
i will never doubt again .
death can not stop true love . all it can do is delay it for a while .
well ... you were dead .
i told you , `` i would always come for you . '' why did n't you wait for me ?
move ? you 're alive . if you want , i can fly .
can you move at all ?
this is true love . you think this happens every day ?
but how can you be sure ?
hear this now : i will come for you .
but what if something happens to you ?
of course you will .
i fear i 'll never see you again .
as you wish .
farm boy . fill these with water -- -- please .
as you wish .
farm boy . polish my horse 's saddle . i want to see my face shining in it by morning .
well ... ... you see , you use different moves when you 're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one .
why should that make such a difference ?
well , i have n't fought just one person for so long . i 've been specializing in groups . battling gangs for local charities , that kind of thing .
why is that , do you think ?
why do you wear a mask ? were you burned by acid , or something like that ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 39 .
and a good thing too .
you 're quick .
i just want you to feel you 're doing well . i hate for people to die embarrassed .
look are you just fiddling around with me or what ?
it 's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest . i do n't even exercise . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 38 .
frankly , i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting .
i could kill you now .
you mean , you 'll put down your rock and i 'll put down my sword , and we 'll try to kill each other like civilized people ?
we face each other as god intended . sportsmanlike . no tricks , no weapons , skill against skill alone .
i believe you -- so what happens now ?
i did that on purpose . i do n't have to miss .
oh , good , my way . thank you , vizzini . which way is my way ?
finish him , finish him . your way .
what do i do ?
give her to me . catch up with us quickly .
i 'm waiting !
you be careful . -- people in masks can not be trusted .
do n't say that , vizzini . please .
-- i do not accept excuses . i 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant , that 's all .
well , i 'm carrying three people . and he 's got only himself .
you were supposed to be this colossus . you were this great , legendary thing . and yet he gains .
i thought i was going faster .
faster !
veer left . left . left !
i only dog paddle .
anybody want a peanut ?
no more rhymes now , i mean it .
am i going mad or did the word `` think '' escape your lips ? you were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .
i just do n't think it 's right , killing an innocent girl .
i 've hired you to help me start a war . that 's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .
you never said anything about killing anyone .
once the horse reaches the castle , the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love . when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier , his suspicions will be totally confirmed .
the country across the sea . the sworn enemy of florin . go !
who 's guilder ?
it 's fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder .
i 'll be right back .
he 's getting away from me , fezzik . please . fezzik !
i hope we win ...
what ?
inigo .
right , right , sorry .
do n't pester him , he 's had a hard day .
at miracle max 's . it fit so nice , he said i could keep it .
where did you get that ?
will this do ?
over the albino , i think .
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had ?
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back .
you 've been mostly dead all day .
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works ?
tilt his head back . open his mouth .
we ca n't wait -- the wedding 's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand .
has it been fifteen minutes ?
what 's the difference ? we 've got him . help me here . we 'll have to force feed him .
inigo -- there 's more than thirty --
i just hope it 's enough to buy a miracle , that 's all . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 91 .
i have a little .
have you any money ?
the body ?
well , we montoyas have never taken defeat easily . come along , fezzik . bring the body .
everybody ... move ! !
-- fezzik , please --
his true love is marrying another tonight , so who else has cause for ultimate suffering ? excuse me --
the man in black ?
do n't bother me with trifles ; after twenty years , at last , my father 's soul will be at peace .
but you do n't know where he is .
to find the man in black , obviously .
-- where ?
-- look , he bested you with strength , your greatness . he bested me with steel . he must have outthought vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle 's onslaught any day . let 's go --
-- what ? --
no -- not vizzini -- i need the man in black --
that leaves twenty for me . at my best , i could never defeat that many . i need vizzini to plan . i have no gift for strategy . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 82 .
i do n't think more than ten .
how many could you handle ?
he 's with the prince in the castle . but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
yeah ?
perhaps not . i feel fine .
you do n't look so good . you do n't smell so good either .
true !
it 's you .
hello .
if there are , we 'll all be dead .
fezzik , are there rocks ahead ?
yes , some of the time .
oh , you 've a great gift for rhyme .
he 's really very short on charm .
probably he means no harm .
as you wish ...
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow .
okay . okay . okay . all right . so long . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 124 .
okay .
now i think you ought to go to sleep .
i do n't mind so much .
no , it 's kissing again . you do n't want to hear it .
what ? what ?
okay . all right , now , let 's see . where were we ? oh yes . in the pit of despair .
no ! i 'm okay . i 'm okay . -- sit down . all right ?
nobody . nobody kills him . he lives . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 90 .
who kills prince humperdinck ? at the end , somebody 's got to do it . is it inigo ? who ?
i do n't understand .
who gets humperdinck ?
you want me to read this or not ?
westley 's only faking , right ?
-- yes , you 're very smart . shut-up .
see ? did n't i tell you she 'd never marry that rotten humperdinck ?
it was ten days till the wedding . the king still lived , but buttercup 's nightmares were growing steadily worse .
all right , then . no more interruptions . ... at noon , she met her subjects again . this time as their queen .
yes .
do you want me to go on with this ?
i 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !
well , who says life is fair ? where is that written ? life is n't always fair .
you read that wrong . she does n't marry humperdinck , she marries westley . i 'm just sure of it . after all that westley did for her , if she does not marry him , it would n't be fair .
oh . you 're sick , i 'll humor you . so now , where were we here ? yeah , yeah , yeah . ah . oh . okay . westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor .
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good .
someday , you may not mind so much .
they 're kissing again , do we have to hear the kissing part ?
what is it ? what 's the matter ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 56 .
oh no . no , please .
no . you could read a little bit more ... if you want . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 17 .
because i can stop now if you want .
well , maybe i was a little bit concerned . but that 's not the same thing .
well , i was n't nervous .
the eel does n't get her . i 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous .
what ?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
westley did n't reach his destination . his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts , who never left captives alive . when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered --
i do n't be-leeve this .
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
keep your shirt on . let me read . westley had no money for marriage . so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea .
-- well , when does it get good ?
-- wait , just wait --
what is this ? are you trying to trick me ? -- where 's the sports ? -- is this a kissing book ?
-hold it , hold it-
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around .
yeah . it 's really good .
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there . his name was westley , but she never called him that . is n't that a wonderful beginning ?
oh . well , thank you very much . it 's very nice of you . your vote of confidence is overwhelming . all right . the princess bride , by s. morgenstern . chapter one . buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin .
it does n't sound too bad . i 'll try and stay awake .
has it got any sports in it ?
that 's right . when i was your age , television was called books . and this is a special book . it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick , and i used to read it to your father . and today , i 'm gon na read it to you .
a book ?
open it up .
what is it ?
i brought you a special present .
the gate has but one key , and i carry that .
double it . my princess must be safe .
the thieves ' forest is emptied . thirty men guard the castle gate .
rise and report .
try ruling the world sometime .
it wo n't be easy , sire .
form a brute squad then . i want the thieves ' forest emptied before i wed .
many of the thieves will resist . my regular enforcers will be inadequate .
she will not be murdered . on the day of the wedding , i want the thieves ' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested .
my spy network has heard no such news .
as chief enforcer of all florin , i trust you with this secret : killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves ' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .
sire .
yellin .
wrong ! your ears you keep , and i 'll tell you why --
-- and then my ears , i understand . let 's get on with it
i was n't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right --
-- and then my tongue , i suppose . i killed you too quickly the last time , a mistake i do n't mean to duplicate tonight .
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
i 'll explain . and i 'll use small words so that you 'll be sure to understand , you wart-hog-faced buffoon .
i do n't think i 'm quite familiar with that phrase .
no . to the pain .
a technicality that will shortly be remedied . but first things first . to the death .
death first ! !
for the last time -- surrender !
it will not happen !
i tell you once again -- surrender !
ah , but how will you capture us ? we know the secrets of the fire swamp . we can live there quite happily for some time . so , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .
i give you full marks for bravery -- do n't make yourself a fool .
you mean you wish to surrender to me ? very well , i accept .
tyrone , you know how much i love watching you work . but , i 've got my country 's five hundredth anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , my wife to murder , and guilder to frame for it . i 'm swamped . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 75 .
now , where is that secret knot ? it 's impossible to find . are you coming down into the pit ? westley 's got his strength back . i am starting him on the machine tonight .
oh , i know . the people are quite taken with her . it 's odd , but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day , i thought that was clever . but it 's going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night . once guilder is blamed , the nation will be truly outraged . they 'll demand we go to war .
your princess is really a winning creature . a trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
then we will simply alert him . beloved , are you certain he still wants you ? after all , it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp . not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
yes .
i could never cause you grief ; consider our wedding off . you returned this westley to his ship ?
of course .
she 's been like that ever since the fire swamp . it 's my father 's failing health that 's upsetting her .
i swear it will be done .
once we 're out of sight , take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair .
i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why i 'm still alive .
could this be a trap ?
the loser is nothing . -- only the princess matters -- -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder . we must be ready for whatever lies ahead . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 42 .
shall we track them both ?
the loser ran off alone . the winner followed those footprints toward guilder !
who won ? how did it end ?
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over . they were both masters .
have you ever considered piracy ? you 'd make a wonderful dread pirate roberts .
you know , it 's very strange -- i have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , i do n't know what to do with the rest of my life .
in that case --
no .
i thought he was with you .
where 's fezzik ?
light him .
now ?
not yet .
now ?
i 'll say -- how do i find the count ? -- once i do , how do i find you again ? -- once i find you again , how do we escape ? --
true , but that 's hardly common knowledge , is it ? thank you . now , there may be problems once we 're inside .
why ? you ca n't even lift one .
there we can not help you .
well , why did n't you list that among our assets in the first place ? what i would n't give for a holocaust cloak .
your brains , fezzik 's strength , my steel .
and our assets ?
and it is guarded by sixty men .
that does n't leave much time for dilly dallying .
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour , so all we have to do is get in , break up the wedding , steal the princess , make our escape after i kill count rugen .
let me explain -- -- no , there is too much . let me sum up . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 99 .
who are you ? -- are we enemies ? why am i on this wall ? -- where 's buttercup ? --
i 'll beat you both apart . i 'll take you both together .
your guess is as good as mine --
i want my father back , you son- ofa-bitch !
-- anything you want --
-- offer me everything i ask for --
-- all that i have and more please --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- yes --
-- offer me money --
no --
stop saying that !
hello . my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die .
okay . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 97 .
thank you for everything .
that is a noble cause . give me the sixty-five , i 'm on the job .
humiliations galore !
sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . except for a nice mlt , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . they 're so perky , i love that . but that 's not what he said . he distinctly said `` to blave . '' and , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' so you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
true love . you heard him . you could not ask for a more noble cause than that .
what 's that ?
now , mostly dead is slightly alive . now , all dead ... well , with all dead , there 's usually only one thing that you can do .
look who knows so much . well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . there 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . please open his mouth .
he 's dead . he ca n't talk .
your first story was better . where 's that bellows ? he probably owes you money , huh ? well , i 'll ask him .
i need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .
are you a rotten liar .
this is noble , sir . his wife is crippled . his children are on the brink of starvation .
sheesh ! i never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 93 .
sixty-five .
do n't rush me , sonny . you rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles . you got money ?
we 're really in a terrible rush .
hah ?
sir . sir .
he is , eh ? i 'll take a look . bring him in .
he 's already dead .
look , i 'm retired . and besides , why would you want someone the king 's stinking son fired ? i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .
the king 's stinking son fired me . and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject . while you 're at it , why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it ? we 're closed !
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years ?
what ? what ?
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself . however , since i ca n't have you following me either --
kill me quickly .
okay .
get used to disappointment .
i must know .
no one of consequence .
who are you ? !
i am not left-handed either .
tell me .
there 's something i ought to tell you .
i ought to be after twenty years .
you 're amazing !
i am not left-handed .
and what is that ?
because i know something you do n't know .
then why are you smiling ?
i admit it -- you are better than i am .
thank you -- i 've worked hard to become so .
you are wonderful !
naturally , you must expect me to attack with capo ferro .
i thought it fitting , considering the rocky terrain --
begin !
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to die .
you seem a decent fellow . i hate to kill you .
whether i am or not , you 've been more than fair . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 30 .
you are ready , then ?
well , i certainly hope you find him , someday .
more pursuit than study lately . you see , i can not find him . it 's been twenty years now . i am starting to lose confidence . i just work for vizzini to pay the bills . there 's not a lot of money in revenge .
you 've done nothing but study swordplay ?
i was eleven years old . when i was strong enough , i dedicated my life to the study of fencing . so the next time we meet , i will not fail . i will go up to the sixfingered man and say , `` hello , my name is inigo montoya . you killed my father . prepare to die . ''
how old were you ?
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man . he was a great swordmaker , my father . and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword , my father took the job . he slaved a year before he was done .
do you always begin conversations this way ?
again . thank you .
we 'll wait until you 're ready .
nothing comes to mind .
you do n't know any way you 'll trust me ?
no good . i 've known too many spaniards .
i hate waiting . i could give you my word as a spaniard .
that 's very comforting . but i 'm afraid you 'll just have to wait .
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top .
that does put a damper on our relationship .
i could do that . in fact , i 've got some rope up here . but i do not think that you will accept my help , since i am only waiting around to kill you .
if you 're in such a hurry , you could lower a rope , or a tree branch , or find something useful to do . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 26 .
i do not suppose you could speed things up ?
thank you .
sorry .
look , i do n't mean to be rude , but this is not as easy as it looks . so i 'd appreciate it if you would n't distract me .
slow going ?
oh , have it your way .
well , it 's the only way i can be satisfied . if i use my right -- tch -- over too quickly .
you know what a hurry we 're in .
i want to duel him left-handed .
you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means . my god ! he 's climbing .
he did n't fall ? inconceivable ! !
inconceivable !
he 's climbing the rope . and he 's gaining on us .
whoever he is , he 's too late -- -- see ? the cliffs of insanity . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 19 .
look ! he 's right on top of us . i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .
i do n't swim . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 15 .
go in , get after her !
what ?
no reason . it 's only , i just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
as i told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable . no one in guilder knows what we 've done . and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast . out of curiosity , why do you ask ?
you 're sure nobody 's following us ?
stop doing that . we can all relax , it 's almost over-
that would be inconceivable .
making sure nobody 's following us .
you only think i guessed wrong -- -- that 's what 's so funny ! i switched glasses when your back was turned . you fool .
you guessed wrong .
i 'll tell you in a minute . first , let 's drink -- me from my glass , and you from yours .
what 's so funny ?
i will . and i choose --
then make your choice .
it has worked -- you 've given everything away -- i know where the poison is .
you 're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it wo n't work --
you 'd like to think that , would n't you ? you 've beaten my giant , which means you 're exceptionally strong . so , you could have put the poison in your own goblet , trusting on your strength to save you . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but , you 've also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied . and in studying , you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
you 're just stalling now .
yes -- australia , and you must have suspected i would have known the powder 's origin , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 46 .
australia .
wait till i get going ! where was i ?
truly , you have a dizzying intellect .
not remotely . because iocane comes from australia , as everyone knows . and australia is entirely peopled with criminals . and criminals are used to having people not trust them , as you are not trusted by me . so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you .
you 've made your decision then7
now , a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet , because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given . i 'm not a great fool , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you . but you must have known i was not a great fool ; you would have counted on it , so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me .
hmm .
what you do not smell is called iocane powder . it is odorless , tasteless , dissolves instantly in liquid , and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man .
i smell nothing .
inhale this , but do not touch .
good . then pour the wine .
i accept .
for the princess ?
really ? in that case , i challenge you to a battle of wits .
morons .
yes .
let me put it this way : have you ever heard of plato , aristotle , socrates ?
you 're that smart ?
i 'm afraid so -- i ca n't compete with you physically . and you 're no match for my brains .
but if there can be no arrangement , then we are at an impasse .
there will be no arrangement -- -- and you 're killing her !
perhaps an arrangement can be reached .
-- there 's nothing to explain . you 're trying to kidnap what i 've rightfully stolen . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 43 .
let me explain-
bye .
it would take a miracle . bye !
think it 'll work ?
have fun storming the castle .
bye-bye , boys .
a good hour . yeah .
yeah , an hour .
an hour .
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier . but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency . and you should n't go swimming after , for at least , what ?
humperdinck . humperdinck ! humperdinck !
nobody 's hearing nothing !
a life expiring and you do n't have the decency to say why you wo n't help --
i 'm not listening .
what , humperdinck ? humperdinck . humperdinck . ooo-ooo , humperdinck
why 'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
he 's afraid . ever since prince humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
do n't say another word , valerie .
`` true love . '' he said , `` true love , '' max . my god --
you never had it so good . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 95 .
i 'm not a witch , i 'm your wife . but after what you just said , i 'm not even sure i want to be that anymore .
-- get back , witch --
maybe he wo n't .
he 'll pinch my cheek . i hate that .
you are sick , that 's why he 's here .
mom , ca n't you tell him that i 'm sick ?
your grandfather 's here .
what ?
guess what .
a little bit .
you feeling any better ?
let 's hear him . what have we got to lose ? what 's your name ?
what are you saying ?
wait ! this is boomerang . this is boomerang .
get on the phone . send out a casting call . call every agent in town . i want to see everybody . everybody .
congratulations .
wait a minute . this is a very big decision . it might effect the course of my entire life . i 'll have to think about it . i 'll do it .
that 's genius . that 's genius . roger , i think i speak for mr. bloom and myself when i say that you 're the only man in the world who can do justice to springtime for hitler .
yes . dopey show-girls in gooey gowns . two-three-kick-turn ! turn- turn-kick-turn ! it 's enough to make you throw up ! at last a chance to do straight drama ! to deal with conflict , with inner truth . roger de bris presents history . of course , i think we should add a little music . that whole third act has got to go . they 're losing the war . it 's too depressing . we 'll have to put something in there . aaahghhh ! i see it ! a line of beautiful girls , dressed as storm troopers , black patent leather boots , all marching together ... two-three-kick-turn ! turn-turn- kick-turn !
i think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you , roger . up to now , you 've always been associated with musicals , and ...
please , please , that 's what we 're here for . be careful , that hurt .
roger , do you mind if we talk a little business ?
how would you like to go back to teasing hair , big mouth ?
`` keep a shining in ...
`` honeymoon , honeymoon ,
`` honeymoon ,
`` he 's gon na croon love 's tune ,
`` to my honey i 'll croon ,
`` he wants to croon , he wants to croon ,
`` i want to croon ,
`` of the silvery mooooon ,
`` of the silvery moon ,
`` by the light , by the light ,
he 's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel . he 's taken money from little old ladies . he 's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of . especially me . but who has he really hurt ?
do n't help me .
ahhhhhh . leo , leo , leo .
well , i ... well , it 's just that ... i 'm sorry i called you fat , fat , fat .
what is it ?
max , i ...
what are you doing ? we 're trapped . it 's either the show or us . there 's no way out . what can we do , blow up the theatre ?
liebkind , no !
they are ? have you ever eaten with one ? liebkind , go ! kill !
shut up .
what ? ? ?
here . buy bullets . kill . kill them all !
double . double . double .
ohhhhhhhhh , how i hate you .
i never should have listened to you .
i 'm turning myself in . it 's the only way . i 'm going to cooperate with the authorities . they 'll reduce my sentence and then there 's time off for good behavior . and maybe i 'll get a job in the prison library . so long .
what are you doing with those books ? where are you going ?
the majority . the majority . yes . let 's hear from the majority .
why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? after all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . let 's hear what the majority thinks .
no way out . no way out . what ? who ?
bloom , bloom , maybe it 's not true .
no way out . no way out .
maybe it 's not true !
to failure !
to failure !
watch closely , as bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin .
here comes the times drama critic .
so much for nutsy fagin .
it 's gorgeous . absolutely gorgeous . you could n't have picked a better color . it brings out your eyes . let 's face it , roger , that dress is you .
well , it 's ... uh ... it 's nice and long ... i mean , it 's ... uh ... uh ... where do you keep your wallet ?
only if we ask him .
do you think he 'll take the job ?
roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived .
roger de bris . roger de bris . oh yes , the director . is he good ... i mean bad ?
stop talking like that , you white mouse ! nothing 's going to go wrong . as a matter of fact , today i have taken steps to insure total disaster . at two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris .
but if something should ... god forbid ... go wrong , at least we could give them some of their money back . it would look better in court .
why ? take it when you can get it ! flaunt it , baby , flaunt it !
max , as i was saying , maybe we should go easy on the spending . i mean these offices and everything .
i 'll show you . ulla , go to work .
what is she gon na do here ?
they 'll say , `` oooh , wah , wah , wah , ooh , ooh . ''
how do you do . have you gone mad ? a receptionist that ca n't speak english . what will people say ?
i 'm going to buy a toy . i worked very , very hard and i think i deserve a toy .
what are you doing ?
oi . i 'm depressed . leo , do me a favor . open the safe . i want to see the money .
then the department of justice owns 100 % of bialystock and bloom .
leo , what if this play is a hit ?
mrs. alma wentworth . she owns 100 % of the profits .
mrs. virginia resnick . she also owns 50 % of the profits .
mrs. eleanor biddlecombe . she also owns 50 % of the profits .
okay , take it off , take it off .
look , i 'm just not wearing this arm band . i do n't care how big the deal is .
there it is ... in red and white ! `` springtime for hitler , '' signed , sealed and delivered . what 's the matter with you ?
shut up , you idiot . he 's a harmless nut . play along with him . it 's almost in the bag .
max , i do n't want to take any siegfried oath . i do n't know what it is , but i do n't want to take it . we might end up in the german army .
who wrote it ?
run a week ? are you kidding ? this play has got to close in the first act .
it wo n't run a week !
a flop , ha ! that 's putting it mildly . a disaster ! a catastrophe ! an outrage ! a guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty !
you found a flop !
i 'll tell you what 's happening . we 've struck gold . not fool 's gold , but real gold . the mother lode . the mother lode . the mother of them all .
max , what is it ? what are you doing ? what 's happening ?
you ca n't feel it when it 's in your hand , when it 's in your pocket .
this is where we belong , leo . on top of the world . top of the world !
i 'll do it ! by god , i 'll do it !
you bet your boots , leo . it 's bialystock and bloom -- on the rise . upward and onward . say , you 'll join me . nothing can stop us .
you 're right . you 're absolutely right . i 'm a nothing . i spend my life counting other people 's money -- people i 'm smarter than , better than . where 's my share ? where 's leo bloom 's share ? i want , i want , i want , i want everything i 've ever seen in the movies !
you think you 're not in prison now ? living in a grey little room . going to a grey little job . leading a grey little life .
yes . that 's it . happy . well , whatta ya think of that . happy .
maybe you 're happy .
i do n't know . i think so . i feel very strange .
everybody 's a big shot . well , leo , are you having a good time ?
two pistachios , my good man .
i do n't know . let 's see . we 've had chocolate , vanilla , banana - let 's go green .
what kind now , leo ?
then stick with bialystock !
right .
nonsense ! as far as whitehall and marks are concerned , you 're working with bialystock , right ?
i ... i love it . i have n't been there since i was a kid . but it 's nearly two o'clock . i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks .
what 's the matter , leo ? do n't you like coney island ?
coney island ? ?
let me see ... it 's such a beautiful day . why waste it indoors . i 've got it ! let 's go to coney island ! we 'll lunch at the sea shore .
well , max , i do n't know , max . what do you think , max ?
where would you like to eat ?
oh .
i already have . come on .
okay ... max ! and you can call me leo .
thank you , leo . and call me max . you know , i do n't let everybody call me max . it 's only people i really like .
i got it , mr. bialystock .
that 's very kind of you , mr. bialystock , but i ...
they certainly do . they certainly do . come , let me take you to lunch .
much , thank you . but i am a little lightheaded . maybe i should eat something . hysterics have a way of severely depleting one 's blood sugar , you know .
well , you know what they say , `` smile and the world smiles with you . '' heh , heh . the man should be in a straight jacket . feeling better ?
good . good . that 's nice . that 's very nice . i think i 'm coming out of it now . yes . yes . i 'm definitely coming out of it . thank you for smiling . it helped a great deal .
how 's this ?
it 's a little better , but you still look angry .
okay . i 'm way over here . is that better ?
go away from me . you frighten me . sit over there .
what can i do ? what can i do ? you 're getting me hysterical .
i 'm hysterical . i 'm having hysterics . i 'm hysterical . i ca n't stop . when i get like this , i ca n't stop . i 'm hysterical .
what are you afraid of ? i 'm not going to hurt you ! what 's the matter with you ?
do n't touch me ! do n't touch me !
will you get a hold on yourself .
aaaaaaaaaa !
i 'm not going to jump on you !
poppea . she was his wife . and she was unfaithful to him . so he got mad and he jumped on her . up and down , up and down , until he squashed her like a bug . please do n't jump on me .
what ? ? ?
you 're going to jump on me . i know you 're going to jump on me -- like nero jumped on poppea .
you 're going to jump on me .
you miserable , cowardly , wretched little caterpillar . do n't you ever want to become a butterfly ? do n't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory ?
oh , i fell on my keys . i 've got to get out of here .
mr. bialystock , not more than five minutes ago , against my better judgment , i doctored your books . that , sir , is the ultimate extent of my criminal life .
no , bloom , you do n't understand . this is fate , this is destiny . there 's no avoiding it .
mr. bialystock . no . wait . please . you 're holding me too tight . i 'm an honest man . you do n't understand .
bloom , worlds are turned on such thoughts !
oh , no . no . no . i meant no scheme . i merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . it 's just a thought .
what scheme ? your scheme , you bloody little genius .
what scheme ?
aha , aha , aha , aha , aha , aha ! ! so , in order for the scheme to work , we 'd have to find a sure fire flop .
oh , you 'd go to jail . if the play were a hit , you 'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?
but what if the play was a hit ?
see ? you could have raised a million dollars , put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest .
one night .
exactly . and how long did it run ?
but the play only cost $ 60,000 to produce .
ahhhhhh ! but that 's where you made your error . you did n't go all the way . you see , if you were really a bold criminal , you could have raised a million .
so what ? what did it get me ? i 'm wearing a cardboard belt .
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play .
what did i do ?
you 've done it yourself , only you did it on a very small scale .
what do you mean ?
well , it 's very easy . you simply raise more money than you really need .
assume away !
you keep saying that , but you do n't tell me how . how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit ?
yes , it 's quite possible .
you were saying that under the right circumstances , a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit .
what was i saying ?
what you were saying . keep talking .
yes , what ?
now let 's see , if we add these figures , we get ...
yes . right . good thinking . you figure it out . i 'm tired . i 'm gon na take a little nap . wake me if there 's a fire .
now let 's see , two thousand dollars . that is n't much . i 'm sure i can hide it somewhere . after all , the department of internal revenue is n't interested in a show that flopped .
nothing . nothing . do it . do it .
oh , it 's all right ... wha ?
thank you , bloom . i knew i could con you .
all right . i 'll do it . i 'll do it .
help !
it 's not cheating ... it 's charity . bloom , look at me ... look at me ! i 'm drowning . other men sail through life . bialystock has struck a reef . bloom , i 'm going under . i am being sunk by a society that demands success , when all i can offer is failure . bloom , i 'm reaching out to you . do n't send me to jail . help ! help !
but that 's cheating !
why should they find out ? it 's only two thousand dollars , bloom , do me a favor , move a few decimal points around . you can do it . you 're an accountant . the word 'count ' is part of your title .
it makes a great deal of difference . that 's fraud . if they found out , you could go to prison .
i went to a turkish bath , who cares ? the show was a flop . what difference does it make ?
according to the backer 's list you raised $ 60,000 . but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . there 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .
where ? what ?
this is hardly a time for levity . i 've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play .
yes , prince mishkin , what can we do for you ?
mr. bialystock ...
they come here . they all come here . how do they find me ?
i 'm sorry ... i do n't like people touching my blue blanket . it 's not important . it 's a minor compulsion . i can deal with it if i want to . it 's just that i 've had it ever since i was a baby and ... and ... i find it very comforting .
here , do n't panic .
it 's nothing ... nothing .
what is that ? a handkerchief ?
twenty-eight seconds , hurry , hurry , you 're using up your time .
in looking at your books , i 've discovered that ...
you have forty-eight seconds left . hurry . hurry .
well , sir , it seems ...
go ! you have fifty-eight seconds .
sir , may i speak to you for a minute ?
good , what is it ?
i have hurt your feelings .
i assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention . am i correct in my assumption , you fish-faced enemy of the people ?
koff , koff ... ahem , ahem ... harrumph ...
look at that . a white rolls royce . that 's it baby , when you got it , flaunt it .
window 's so filthy , ca n't tell if it 's day or night out there .
yes , sir . thank you .
do the books ! do the books !
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect . one ... two ...
shut up . i 'm having a rhetorical conversation . how humiliating . max bialystock . max bialystock .
but sir , i 'm not condem ...
then account for yourself ! do you believe in god ? do you believe in gold ? why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? bit of a pervert , eh ?
yes sir .
i 'm leo bloom , i 'm an accountant , i 'm from whitehall and marks , i was sent here to do your books and i 'm terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady .
all right . get a hold of yourself . take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .
scared . ca n't talk .
who are you ? what do you want ? why are you loitering in my hallway ? speak , dummy , speak ! why do n't you speak ?
uh ... uh ... ooooooops ?
ooooooops .
oooooooops !
i 'll wait in the hall ...
you mean ooops , do n't you ? say ooops and get out .
how do you do . i mean ... excuse me ... i mean ...
enough . it 's better . please , lambchop , it 's better . stop . you 're hurting it again .
of course i need you . it 's dark in there .
do you need us ?
i ca n't . i ca n't do it . it 's a demon . it 's a gargoyle , it 's a monster ... but it 's still my child .
do it ! do it !
all right . finish the job . let 's get outta here .
vhy do you always call me kraut ? kraut is cabbage ! do ve call you hot dogs ? ve call you yanks not franks !
yes . amazing is n't it ?
you mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on ?
here . you see . this is the slow fuse . it is much wider . it has more resistance , more density . therefore , it burns slower .
qviet . qviet this is very important .
come on . let 's get going .
plus to minus . negative to positive . male to ...
you mean out of business . heh , heh .
now ve take the two fuse leads , attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve 're in business .
it 's that lsd und his verdampter babies ! ...
never mind . listen . every night people are laughing at your beloved fuhrer . why ?
always .
you crazy lunatic ! what are you shooting at us for ? why do n't you use this where it will do us some good ? why do n't you shoot the actors ? liebkind , have i ever steered you wrong ?
vhere ? vhere ? ... oh ...
i 'm not crazy . i 'm inept .
five o'clock . killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut .
cowards , miserable cringing cowards . clinging to life like baby butterflies . vatch , vatch and remember . franz liebkind vill show you how to die like a man !
not .
all right , but remember , if you damage the fuhrer 's reputation , i kill you .
franz , trust me . i promise i wo n't let you down .
i do n't know . i do n't know .
do n't look at the outside , look at the inside . it 's the inner hitler we 're after . the young beautiful hitler , who danced his way to glory .
but he has long hair !
franz , do n't you see , hitler was a man of his time . this is a man of his time .
vaaaat ? ? ?
it was the same thing in germany . we looked for years before we found the right hitler .
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one ...
good . i will make the preparations .
yes . we would !
not good enough ... vould you be villing to take the siegfried oath ?
we swear it !
wait . no . how do i know i can trust you ? how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived ?
that 's exactly why we want to do this play . to show the world the true hitler , the hitler you knew , the hitler you loved , the hitler with a song in his heart .
that 's because you were taken in by that verdampter allied propaganda . such filthy lies . but nobody said a bad vord about winston churchill , did they ? oh no , vin vit vinnie ! churchill , vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings . could n't even say nazi . he would say narzis , narzis . ve vere not narzies , ve vere nazis . but let me tell this , and you 're getting it straight from the horse , hitler vas better looking than churchill , he vas a better dresser than churchill , had more hair , told funnier jokes , and could dance the pants off churchill !
really , i never dreamed ...
oh , sure . i used to take him his hot milk and his opium . achhh , those were the days . vat good times ve had . dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen , singing und dancing . you know , not many people knew about it , but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer .
no kidding ?
vit the fuhrer , of course . he liked me . out of all the household staff at berchtesgarten , i vas his favorite . i vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime .
with whom ?
i vas vit him a great deal , you know .
you 're not , as you americans say , dragging my leg , are you ?
we loved it . we thought it was a masterpiece . that 's why we 're here . we want to produce it on broadway .
vat about it ?
yes .

we are falling back on all fronts . our soldiers are retreating .
groovy !
we won .
hey , baby , that 's good ! how 'd we come out ?
i told them we invaded england .
what did you tell the people ?
heil , baby ! i just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts .
he 's the only cat left that still grooves me .
all right ! might save me a lot of leg-work if i could just talk to your mother . but i 'd need a warrant for that , wo n't i ?
no ! just no ! i have one of those breaking points like any other man , believe it or not , and i 'm near it . there 's just so much pushing i can take and i think ...
sick old women are sharp . come on , i wo n't disturb ...
just for a moment . she might have picked up a hint you 'd miss .
no . i told you , she 's confined ...
your mother met her ? can i talk to your mother ?
that 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . but ... she did n't fool my mother .
i did n't mean that as a slur on your manhood . i 'm sorry .
i 'm not a fool ! and i 'm not capable of being fooled ! not even by women !
or if she had you say ... gallantly protecting her ... you would n't be fooled ... you 'd know she was just using you . would n't you ?
now , look ... !
if she paid you well ?
of course not .
if this girl mary crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide her would you ?
she 's ... ill. confined to her room . it 's practically living alone .
my mother .
someone is sitting in that window .
i live there . alone .
anyone at home ?
i guess i 've got one of those faces you ca n't help believing .
look , if you wo n't believe me , go ahead . you can help me make beds if you like . come on .
suppose i wanted to search the cabins , all twelve ... would i need a warrant ?
not at all !
she is n't still here , is she ?
i do n't know what you expect me to know about ... people come and go ...
i do mind . if it do n't jell , it ai n't aspic ! this ai n't jelling .
why should she ? i 'm sorry , i have work to do , mr ... if you do n't mind ...
and when she left , she never came back .
cash .
cash or check ? for the cabin ...
what ?
how did she pay you ?
oh . my private parlor . she had an awful hunger ... so i made her some supper . and then she went to bed and left in the morning . i did n't even see her leave .
you said she was sitting `` back there , '' or standing rather ...
what do you mean ?
back where ?
she was tired . she said she had a long drive ahead of her , in the morning ... yes , now i 'm remembering very clearly because i 'm picturing . when you make a picture of the moment in your mind , you can remember every detail . she was sitting back there , no she was standing up , with some sandwich still in her hand , and she said she had to drive a long way .
how do you know she did n't make a call ?
no ! of all ...
you did n't spend the whole night with her did you ?
no .
she did n't call anyone ? even locally ?
no .
or arrived with her .
no .
no one met her ?
the following morning . sunday .
of which morning ?
very early . dawn .
how early ?
she arrived kind of late , wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early .
tell me all about her .
it was raining and her hair did n't look like that ... damped out , i guess .
i did n't lie to you . i just have trouble keeping track of ... time .
do n't know where she got `` marie , '' but `` samuels '' figures . her boy friend 's name is sam . was she in disguise ? or do you want to check the picture again ?
you thought no one has stopped here in weeks . now , try to remember if this girl ...
what ?
now there 's a couple even remarking about your sign , and see how easily you forgot them ?
i do n't even bother with guests registering any more ... i mean , little by little , you drop the formalities . i should n't even bother to change the linen . i guess habits die hard . which reminds me ...
she might have used an alias . mary crane 's the real name , but she might 've registered ...
no . at least i do n't recall .
look at the picture . please .
committing myself to what ? you sure talk like a policeman .
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself ?
no . no one has stopped here in weeks ...
we have reason to believe she came this way ... might have stopped in this area ... did she stop here ?
oh .
i 'm not the police .
i did n't think the police went searching for people who were n't in trouble .
i 'm looking for a missing person . my name 's arbogast , private investigator ... trying to trace a young girl who 's been missing almost a week . from phoenix . it 's a private matter ... family wants to forgive her ... she is n't in trouble .
oh . i thought ... you said you 'd been to so many in two days ... what was it you wanted to ask ?
no .
you out to buy a motel ?
no trouble . today 's linen day . i change all the beds once a week , whether they 've been used or not ... dampness . i hate the smell of dampness . it 's such a dank smell .
sit down . i do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask ...
i do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem ... any use . this used to be the main highway . want to register , please ?
in the past two days i 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
i always forget to put the sign on , but we do have vacancy . twelve in fact . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .
i do n't believe it . do you ?
she was seen leaving town in her car . seen by her very victims , i might add .
did you check in phoenix ... hospitals ... maybe she had an accident ... a hold-up ...
what are you talking about ? what is this ?
must 've needed it .
why ?
your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars .
somebody better tell me what 's going on and tell me fast ! i can take so much and then ...
money .
what 's your interest ?
milt arbogast , private investigator . where is she , miss crane ?
who are you , friend ?
let 's all talk about mary .
i do n't care if you do or ... i want to see mary ... before she gets in any deeper ...
with a little checking , i could get to believe you .
not even a hunch . just hope .
you came up here on a hunch , miss crane ? nothing more ? no phone call ... from him , or from your sister herself ?
sam , if she 's here ...
casharoonie !
sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . it was all in cash ...
someone has seen her . someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . she is your girl friend , is n't she ?
would n't have been able to tail you if you did .
i do n't know .
okay . if you 'll come along ...
i 'd like to be ready when he gets back .
no , m'am . i was only about to say , i 've sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test ... that 's all .
but what ? is there anything so terribly wrong about ... making a decision and wanting to hurry ? do you think i 've stolen ... my car ?
i 'll be perfectly honest with you , ma'am . it 's not that i do n't trust you , but ...
i 'd really rather not . please . ca n't we just settle this and ...
i think you 'd better give it a trial spin . do n't want any bad word of mouth about california charlie .
in the building ... mary starts for the building , glancing once in the direction of the patrolman .
i think i have the necessary papers . is there a ladies room ...
i take it ... you can prove that car 's yours ... i mean , out of state and all ... got your pink slip and your ...
all right .
aha ! always got time to argue money , huh ... ?
five hundred .
well ... heck , this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman ! i 'd figure roughly ... ... your car plus five hundred .
of course not . please .
you mean you do n't want the usual day and a half to think it over ? you are in a hurry ! somebody chasin ' you ?
it looks fine . how much will it be , with my car ... ?
go ahead ! spin it around the block . now i know you do n't know anything about engine condition , but you can feel , ca n't you ... and it 's all in the feel , believe me , you feel that one around the block ...
how much ?
that 's the one i'd 've picked for you myself !
no . thank you . i 'm in ... a hurry . i just want to make a change and start ...
sick of the sight of it ! well , suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile i 'll have my mechanic give yours the once over and ... want some coffee ? i was just about ...
yes , it 's ... nothing wrong with it , i 'm just ...
you can do anything you 've a mind to ... and bein ' a woman , you will ! that yours ?
can i trade in my car and take another ?
there 's an old saying , `` first customer of the day is always the most trouble ! '' but like i said , i 'm in no mood for it so i 'm just going to treat you so fair and square you wo n't have one human reason to give me ...
what ?
i 'm in no mood for trouble !
i do n't need pills ... just sleep .
are n't you going to take the pills ? they 'll knock that headache out .
teddy called . me ... and my mother called to see if teddy called . oh , and your sister called to say she 's going to tucson to do some buying and she 'll be gone the whole weekend and ...
were there any calls ?
you got aspirins ? i have something ... not aspirins , but my mother 's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding . teddy was furious when he found out i 'd taken tranquilizers !
it 'll pass . headaches are like resolutions ... you forget them soon as they stop hurting .
he 's lunching with the man who 's buying the harris street property , you know , that oil lease man ... so that 's why he 's late . you getting a headache ?
is n't mr. lowery back from lunch ?
her sister 's going to do that . she 's as worried as we are .
you better run out to the house . she may be ... unable to answer the phone ...
i called her sister , mr. lowery , where she works , the music makers music store , you know ? and she does n't know where mary is any more than we do .
call her sister ! if no one 's answering at the house ... .
buzz me the minute she comes in .
no , mr. lowery ... but then she 's always a bit late on monday mornings .
caroline ... ? mary still is n't in ?
yes , mr. lowery .
i do n't know .
can see you do . sorry i could n't make you feel better . you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person ... and the theft , is what you want to do ! sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law , that 's the sooner you 'll stand a chance of your sister bein ' picked up . how about that ?
i still feel ...
just what he told your detective .
did he say anything about my sister ?
norman bates ' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years !
yes .
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie .
what difference does that ...
you should 've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped . you go starting private investigations , using people you do n't even know ...
sorry i got you up , boy . go back to sleep . yeah , be glad to . said to give you his regards .
please !
he said he was dissatisfied ... and was going back .
i think something 's wrong , too , miss . but not the same thing . i think your private detective is what 's wrong . i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going ... probably from norman bates ... and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money .
go out there ! find somebody , ask some questions ! i 'm sorry if i seem over-anxious to you . i keep thinking ... something 's wrong . i have to know what !
like what ?
he did n't mention the money . what he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! that 's what i want you to do something about !
with the forty thousand dollars ?
mary had been there , one night , and had left .
and the police have n't been able to ...
forty thousand dollars .
a lot ?
she stole some money .
she ai n't missing so much as she 's run away .
yes .
how 'd you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale ?
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday . and no trace until ...
now . your sister is missing how long ?
will you help us ? i think something 's wrong out there !
i could stand something regular .
it 's regular . okay ?
bates .
why not ?
you ca n't go up there .
sam , that old woman , whoever she is . i think she told arbogast something ! and i want her to tell us the same thing !
do we simply ask him where he 's hidden it ?
yes . but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money .
bates never denied mary was here .
that 's proof mary was here ! it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to ...
it did n't get washed down . it 's figuring ... the kind you tear up and get rid of . some figure has been added to or subtracted from ... forty thousand .
what is it ?
the bathroom . look at how clean it is . the one in our cabin is clean ... but this is clean !
what ?
hospital clean .
sorry .
arbogast ! sam , he liked me ... or felt sorry for me ... and he was starting to feel the same about you . i heard it when he called ... in his voice , a caring . he would n't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us . unless he was stopped . and he was stopped , so he must have found out something !
what makes you sound so certain ?
there must be some proof that exists right now ! something that proves he got that money away from mary ... some way !
how could we prove ... well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway ... say , a year from now ...
sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel ... one you probably could n't even sell ... what would you need to get away , to start a new business , somewhere else ? forty thousand dollars ?
i know . do you think if something happened , it happened there ?
we have to go into that cabin and search it , sam ... no matter what we 're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt .
i 'm glad we did n't .
we should have asked for cabin one ... the one mary was in .
someone was at that window . i saw the curtain move .
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting ?
i believe it .
you wo n't believe it ... but this will be the first time i 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers !
we 're going to register . as man and wife . and get shown to a cabin ... and then search every inch of that place , inside and ... outside .
i 'm going with you . but we 'd better decide what we 're going to say and do when we walk in ...
you going to wait here for me ?
she always tries to be proper .
huh ?
watch your tenses .
i suppose ... when you were able to marry her she 'd have presented you , all shiny and proper ... she always tried to be proper .
this is the old highway .
do you know how i found out about you ? i found one of your letters ... it was a nice letter , sam .
we were going to get married . are going to get married !
i wonder so many things about her now . why she never told me about you ... funny , when you think there 's an answer to everything , you think you know all the answers .
she was willing to lick the stamps .
i did n't . i got a job , too . i wonder if that hurt her , my not letting her sacrifice for me ? some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do n't let them .
where 'd you go to college ?
alive .
of course we will .
i wonder if we 'll ever see mary again .
neither will i .
i wo n't feel satisfied unless i got out there , sam .
you 're not .
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type .
all right ! then call ! at least , call !
i 've only been here five . right now it feels like ten , but ...
this is lila crane , from phoenix . she 's been here for a few days , looking for her sister . there 's a private detective helping ... and , well , we got a call tonight , from this detective , saying he 'd traced mary ...
yes .
i do n't know where to start ... except at the beginning .
no , thank you . it 's my problem , too .
no . i 'm just procrastinating . people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night . come on .
does that mean we ca n't ...
nothing . just ... all the lights out ... must be asleep .
well ?
our deputy sleeps .
he 's the deputy sheriff around here .
who 's he ?
let 's go see al chambers .
yes . i think he would have .
sam , he called me when he had nothing definite , nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything ...
in a hurry .
without calling me ?
maybe he got some definite lead . maybe he went right on ...
where could he have gone ?
no arbogast . no bates . and only the old lady at home ... a sick old lady unable to answer the door ... or unwilling .
sam .
he did n't come back here ?
contemplate your ... panic button .
just wait here ?
i do n't know ... one of us has to be here in case arbogast 's on the way .
why ca n't i go out there with you ?
stay here .
you 'll never find it .
sam , i 'm going .
probably on his way back right now .
and maybe pass arbogast on the road ? thanks .
sam ! why call when we can go ?
got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? bates , i think .
an hour ! or less !
arbogast said ...
patience does n't run in our family . sam , i 'm going out there !
that would n't be a wise thing to do .
yes .
you want to run out there , bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady , shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogast 's been building for the last three hours .
where 's the old highway ?
i feel better when you feel better .
whenever i start contemplating the panic button , your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and ... i feel better .
hundreds ! which one is your pet ?
you have an awfully nice habit , sam .
he 'll be back . let 's sit still and hang on , okay ?
are we just going to go on sitting here ?
it 's been three .
sam . he said an hour . or less .
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound . ever notice , lila ?
first rate hotel , fifty yards up the street . come on . after we check you in we 'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich . then we 'll come back here ... and wait .
where ... can i stay ?
she 'll need both of us .
you want me to stay here ?
i think she 'll contact me if she contacts anybody . why do n't you stay here . when she shows up ... or calls ... be here .
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation ... for all i know , she may be trying to get in touch with me , at home . i 'd better go home .
maybe we can handle it together .
no . i just think ... anything can be explained . but mary , doing a thing like this ... i do n't know how to handle ...
you 've led a charmed life .
i need to ... i need to believe something . this is the first time i 've ever come up against anything i could n't ... understand .
i did n't see her ... and i did n't hear from her ! believe that !
she have n't even called you ?
how could i go away ? i 'm in debt up to my ... if she did steal that money ... it 's hard to believe she did because it 's hard to see why she would . unless she had some wild idea that it would help me ... us ...
why not ? sam , is she hiding here ? are you two planning to go away with the money ?
no .
i ought to call the police right now !
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it ... all that cash ...
no . the man whose money she ... he talked so loud and fast , and i ... i should 've called the police .
it was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
i just listened ... and believed everything they told me . 'she stole the money . ' 'we do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'no do n't bring the police in ' ...
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so , sister .
yes ... i just ... did . the moment they told me ...
never mind my ego . let 's talk about mary .
not that kind ... you men and your egos .
well why did n't she come to me ... call me ... ?
yes .
is mary ... in trouble ?
i hate tears .
what thing could we be in together ?
huh ?
what thing ?
look , if you two are in this thing together , i do n't care , it 's none of my business ... but i want to see mary . i want her to tell me she 's all right and it 's none of my business . then i 'll go back to phoenix and ...
nothing ! you 're putting me on the defensive .
what do you know about it ?
i was getting to that !
mr. loomis , you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even reacted to the most serious fact of all . mary is missing .
well what do you think , we eloped or something ? or we 're living in sin and ...
a good reason , i suppose .
and you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? if she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?
last friday . she left work , and home ... i was in tucson over the weekend ... i have n't heard from her , not even a phone call .
no . i take it you do n't either ? how long ?
to begin with , where mary is . do you ?
what should i know ?
do n't you know ?
what 's the matter ?
i do n't know where . in your store , somewhere in your town ... anywhere .
where ?
with you .
here ?
i want to know if my sister is here .
is something wrong ?
is mary here ?
lila .
i 'm mary 's sister .
sure ...
may i talk to you ?
yes ?
i 'm late ... and you have to put your shoes on .
hey , we can leave together ca n't we ?
do n't miss your plane .
how can you even think a thing like that !
i 'm thinking of it .
you know what i 'd like ? a clear , empty sky ... and a plane , and us in it ... and somewhere a private island for sale , where we can run around without our ... shoes on . and the wherewithal to buy what i 'd like . mary , you want to cut this off , go out and find yourself someone available .
i 'll lick the stamps .
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale . we 'll have a lot of laughs . when i send my ex-wife her money , you can lick the stamps .
sam , let 's go get married .
yeah , but when you do ... you 'll swing .
i have n't even been married once yet !
a couple of years and the debts will be paid off . and if she ever re- marries , the alimony stops ... and then ...
i pay , too . they also pay who meet in hotel rooms .
i 'm fed up with sweating for people who are n't there . i sweat to pay off my father 's debts ... and he 's in his grave ... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony , and she 's living on the other side of the world somewhere .
i 'm all for it ! it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out ... otherwise , though , it 's only hard work . but if i can see you , touch you even as simply as this ... i wo n't mind .
you make respectability sound ... disrespectful .
mary , whenever it 's possible , tax- deductible or not , i want to see deductible you . and under any conditions . even respectability .
all right .
sam ! no !
and after the steak ... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama 's picture to the wall ?
we can see each other , we can even have dinner ... but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three !
not even just to see you , to have lunch ... in public ?
no .
i can come down next week .
i have to go , sam .
i wish i were . not an active criminal but ... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal . next best thing to no conscience at all .
you could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime .
and besides , when you say i make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal .
sure . it 's like laughing through a broken jaw , but ...
can you ?
you ca n't laugh at it , huh ?
it is tragic ! or it will be ... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here ...
and i 'm a working man ! we 're a regular working-class tragedy !
i have n't time to argue . i 'm a working girl .
okay . what do we do instead , write each other lurid love letters ?
this ! meeting you in secret so we can be ... secretive ! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and ... i wish you would n't even come .
for what ?
sam . this is the last time .
the only girlish thing you have lost .
i 've lost my girlish laughter .
i 'm sorry , mary . my old dad used to say 'when you ca n't change a situation , laugh at it . ' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .
sam !
you sure talk like a girl who 's been married .
when you 're married you can do a lot of things deliberately .
i 've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels . they say it ...
checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in , but when your time 's up ... sam , i hate having to be with you in a place like this .
we could laze around here a while longer .
what do i do with my free afternoon , walk you to the airport ?
call your boss and tell him you 're taking the rest of the afternoon off . it 's friday anyway ... and hot .
good night .
that 's it .
crane .
alright , miss ...
very early . dawn .
alright . i 'll see you in the morning . i 'll bring you breakfast . what time will you ...
i 'd like to , but ...
why do n't you stay a little while , just for talking .
i stepped into a private trap back there -- and i want to go back and ... try to pull myself out . before it 's too late for me , too .
phoenix ?
i 'm very tired . and i 'll have a long drive tomorrow . all the way back to phoenix .
you 're not going to ... to your room already ?
norman .
thank you , norman .
yes , and just one time can be enough . thank you .
i 've suggested it myself . but i hate to even think such a thing . she needs me ... and it is n't ... ... it is n't as if she were a maniac , a raving thing ... it 's just that ... sometimes she goes a little mad . we all go a little mad sometimes . have n't you ?
well ? you meant well ? people always mean well , they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that ...
i am sorry . i only felt ... it seemed she was harming you . i meant ...
what do you mean about caring ? have you ever seen one of those places ? inside ? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you ... and my mother there ? why ? has she harmed you ? she 's as harmless as ... one of these stuffed birds .
i 'm sorry ... i did n't mean it to sound uncaring ...
an institution ? a madhouse ? people always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' put her in someplace !
would n't it be better if you put her in ... someplace ...
it 's too late for me . and besides ... who 'd look after her ? she 'd be alone up there , the fire would go out ... damp and cold , like a grave . when you love someone , you do n't do that to them , even if you hate them . oh , i do n't hate her . i hate ... what she 's become . i hate ... the illness .
no , not like me .
to a private island , like you ?
why do n't you go away ?
a son is a poor substitute for a lover .
except you .
i mean ... ill. she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died ... i was only five ... and it must have been a strain . oh , she did n't have to go out to work or anything , dad left us with a little something ... anyway , a few years ago ... mother met a man . he talked her into building this motel ... we could have talked her into anything ... and when . well ... it was just too much for her when he died , too ... and the way he died ... oh , it 's nothing to talk about when you 're eating . anyway , it was too much of a loss for my mother ... she had nothing left .
she sounded strong ...
sometimes when she talks that way to me i 'd like to ... curse her out and leave her forever ! or at least , defy her . but i could n't . she 's ill .
if anyone ever spoke to me , the way i heard ... the way she spoke to you , i do n't think i could ever laugh again .
oh i do ... but i say i do n't .
you should ... mind it .
i was born in mine . i do n't mind it anymore .
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .
no . people never run away from anything . the rain did n't last very long . you know what i think ? i think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever climb out . we scratch and claw ... but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch .
why do you ask that ?
what are you running away from ?
i 'm looking for a private island .
where are you going ? i do n't mean to pry ...
only my share .
friends ? who needs friends . a boy 's best friend is his mother . you 've never had an empty moment in your whole life . have you ?
you go out ... with friends ?
oh , no ! i run the office , tend the cabins and grounds , do little chores for mother ... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing .
is your time so empty ?
it 's more than a hobby ... sometimes ... a hobby is supposed to pass the time , not fill it .
a man should have a hobby .
it 's not as expensive as you 'd think . cheap , really . needles , thread , sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything .
i imagine so .
uncommon , too .
it 's a strange hobby . curious , i mean .
not really . i hear that expression , that one eats `` like a bird , '' is really a falsie , i mean a falsity , because birds eat a tremendous lot . oh , i do n't know anything about birds . my hobby is stuffing things ... taxidermy . and i guess i 'd just rather stuff birds because ... well , i hate the look of beasts when they 're stuffed , foxes and chimps and all ... some people even stuff dogs and cats ... but i ca n't ... i think only birds look well stuffed because they 're rather ... passive , to begin with ... most of them ...
you 'd know , of course .
you eat like a bird .
it 's all for you . i 'm not hungry . please go ahead .
you 're very ... kind .
do n't worry about it . but as long as you 've made us supper , we may as well eat it . huh ?
i 'm sorry . i wish ... people could apologize for other people .
you should n't have bothered . i really do n't have that much of an appetite .
mother ... ... what is the phrase ... `` she is n't herself today '' ... i think that 's it .
i 've caused you some trouble .
all right , you get your dresses hanging out and ... change those wet shoes , and i 'll come for you soon as it 's ready ... ... with my trusty umbrella .
i 'd like to .
then will you do me a favor ? will you have supper here ? i was just about to , myself ... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk , but i 'd like it if you 'd come up to the house and ... i do n't set a fancy table but ... the kitchen 's awful homey .
no .
you 're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner , are you ?
thank you . again .
there 's no name for it ... but it 's something that , that puts a person at ease .
i have ?
you have something most girls never have .
norman bates .
thank you , mr. bates .
i 'll be in the office if you want anything ... just tap on the wall .
the bathroom .
stuffy in here . well ... the mattress is soft and there 're hangers in the closet and ... stationary with `` bates ' motel '' printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious ... and ... the ... over there ... .
fifteen miles . i 'll get your bags .
am i that close to fairvale ?
there 's a big diner about ten miles on up ... just outside fairvale .
i want sleep more than anything . except maybe , food .
los angeles .
your home address . oh , just the town will do .
i knew you must have . no one stops here anymore unless they do .
i thought i 'd gotten off the main ...
we have twelve vacancies . twelve cabins , twelve vacancies . they moved away the highway .
you have a vacancy ?
dirty night .
please .
why ?
may i see your license ?
now what ?
wait a minute !
no need to apologize ...
i 'm sorry .
in the course of my duty , i never `` take up '' anyone 's time , whether it 's to give a warning , or a ticket , or help ! believe that , m'am . now if you woke up on the wrong side of ... the car seat , that 's one thing . but when you act as if i 've just placed you under arrest ...
now wait just a moment ! turn your motor off , please .
is there what ? i 've told you there 's nothing wrong ... except that i 'm in a hurry and you 're taking up my time ...
is there ?
please ... i 'd like to go ...
frankly , yes .
of course not ! am i acting as if ... something 's wrong ?
is anything wrong ?
then i 'm free to go ... ?
no , m'am .
i did n't intend to sleep all night ! i just pulled over ... have i broken any laws ?
there are plenty of motels in this area . you should have ... i mean , just to be safe ...
yes . as i said , i could n't keep my eyes ...
you slept here all night ?
yes . i did n't mean to sleep so long . i was afraid i 'd have an accident last night , from sleepiness ... so i decided to pull over ...
in quite a hurry .
he 's already been .
we thought , if you did n't mind , we 'd go out to the motel with you .
i 'd know the difference between mary and an old woman .
maybe you saw mary !
you mean that old woman i saw sittin ' in the window was n't norman bates ' mother ?
no . an old woman , his mother . that was early this evening . and we have n't seen or heard from him since . i went out to the motel , just got back . no one was in the office , and ...
norman took a wife ?
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates ...
bates ' motel . he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it ... go on , sam .
yes . he traced her to that motel , out on the old highway ...
mary is lila 's sister ?
let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
we have a problem .
you did n't ! it 's tinkerbell . al wants to be sure he 'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night . well come on in , at least !
sorry , mrs. chambers . i hate bothering you ...
oh ?
have you two had breakfast ?
went out before service .
norman found them dead together . in bed .
it ai n't only local history , sam , it 's the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers ! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was ... involved with , when she found out he was married , then took a helping of the same stuff herself . strychnine . ugly way to die .
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in . periwinkle blue .
he told you he was n't coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates ' mother , right ?
barefaced .
arbogast . and after he left ? no , it 's okay , norman . how 's it been going out there ? well , i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action , a smaller place , you know ... but ...
arbogast .
norman ? sheriff chambers . been just fine , thanks . listen , we got some worries here . did you have a man stop out there tonight ... well , this one would n't be a customer , anyway . a private detective , name of ...
you must remember that bad business out there . about ten years ago ...
recluse . kinder word .
at this hour ?
why do n't you call norman and let him say just what happened , if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off ... it 'll make the girl feel better , albert .
leave me alone !
... forty thousand dollars !
leave me alone !
where will you get the money to do that , bates ... or do you already have it ... socked away ... a lot of it ...
shut up !
buy a new one ! in a new town ! where you wo n't have to hide your mother !
do what ?
i 've been talking about your mother ... about your motel . how are you going to do it ?
i do n't know what you 've been saying .
you look frightened . have i been saying something frightening ?
i did n't think so .
my mother is not dead !
and now that your mother 's dead ?
this place ! this is n't 'a place . ' it 's my only world . i grew up in that house back there . i was a happy child . my mother and i ... we were more than happy .
i 'm not saying you should n't be contented here , i 'm just doubting that you are . i think if you saw a chance to get out from under ... you 'd unload this place ...
just an expression ... what i meant was ... i 'd do just about anything ... to get away . would n't you ?
that would be a rather extreme reaction , would n't it ?
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance . yet there you are , doing all the listening ! you are alone here , are n't you ? it would drive me crazy .
yes .
i 've been doing all the talking so far , have n't i ?
fine .
satisfied with your cabin ?
yes , matter of fact . the wife 's taking a nap and ... i can never keep quiet enough for her ... so i thought i 'd look you up and ... talk .
looking for me ?
i 'll show you the cabin .
have n't any .
i 'll get your bags .
uh , uh ! my boss is paying for this trip ... ninety percent business ... and he wants practically notarized receipts . i better sign in and get a receipt .
it is n't necessary .
better sign in first , has n't we ?
i 'll take you to ...
we 'd hoped to make it straight to san francisco , but we do n't like the look of that sky . looks like a bad day coming ... does n't it .
i suppose you want a cabin .
just coming up to ring for you .
shut up ! shut up !
go on , go tell her she 'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food ... or my son ! or do i have to tell her , cause you do n't have the guts ? huh , boy ? you have the guts , boy ?
mother , she 's just a stranger ! as if men do n't desire strangers , as if ... oh , i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me ! you understand , boy ?
mother , she 's just a stranger ... hungry , and the weather 's bad ...
and then what ? after supper , music ? whispers ?
mother , please ...
i wo n't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper ... ... by candlelight , i suppose , in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap , erotic minds !
you must 've seen an illusion , sam . now , i know you 're not the seeing- illusion type ... but no woman was illusion there and i do n't believe in ghosts , so there it is !
no mother .
nothing . here , let 's clear the path .
you did n't find anything .
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates ' mother .
yes ! in the house behind the motel . i pounded and called but she ... just ignored me .
now wait a minute , sam . you sure you saw an old woman ?
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away .
was that all ?
he was n't out when you were there . he just was n't answering the door in the dead of night ... like some people do . this fellow lives like a hermit ...
he was out when i was there . if he 's back he probably is n't even in bed yet .
explains the private detective . he traced her to the bates place . what 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
everyone concerned thought ... if they could get her to give back the money ... they could avoid involving her with the police .
from what ?
yes .
left phoenix under her own steam ?
they thought she 'd be coming to me .
what -- special autopsy ?
that 's the one that 's got the coroner doing nightwork .
did i ?
you did n't even mention the suicides . did you notice the beaut that came in today ?
yeah , between the gangsters and the autos , we wo n't need another war to carry off the population .
by gosh , them stiffs are get- tin ' heavier and more of 'em every day . they even got the coroner working overtime .
[ was it ] & quot ; meirschultz & quot ; ?
said & quot ; doctor & quot ; -- [ something ]
did she talk ?
just before she died she came to --
never mind your theories . was she ever conscious ?
imagine -- she was alive . what a horror . could have been buried alive . she must have run away from the morgue .
how about me getting the help . she 's quiet now , is n't she ?
that 's what i said . now , lis- ten to me . i want you to help me take this woman down stairs . i will give her a shot . you can take care of her till i get help .
what do you mean & quot ; our & quot ; ?
quiet , will you ? this is ser- ious . our lives are in danger .
ha ha , < u > you < /u > have been treating .
i knew there was a catch in this some place -- but spill it . quiet and dramatic . maxwell in the other room , i have a crazy woman that i have been treating .
no , i would n't be surprised at anything from you . winningly . maxwell now , honey -- you are here in time to help me and you can --
sure -- i have one little job to accomplish , then we can leave together . no doubt you are surprised at this disguise .
then you knew of the inheritance ?
[ perfectly friendly , my dear . ] at last , i have really a secure living for us . we can travel or anything we choose .
so -- friendly or otherwise -- ?
sh -- sh -- i want to have a few words with you quietly .
gosh , you had me fooled .
okay -- i 'll be here at eight .
that 's only natural . maxwell will be here around eight tonight .
do n't tell him . i want to be the first to bring him the news .
i am certainly glad to hear it . i know he 'll be pleased .
he hardly knew of them him- self . i believe it was his uncle in australia .
you say a fortune . he never spoke to me of any rich relatives .
he 's inherited a fortune .
indeed , he has often told me .
it is -- you know what a struggle he 's had .
no , not exactly . why the great anxiety ? it must be something important .
you mean he does n't work for you ?
i understand my husband is -- your assistant . may i see him please ?
did you wish to see someone ?
take him to the psychopathic hospital .
yes -- i ca n't stand it -- everybody wants papers -- oh , oh
dr. meirschultz , too ?
papers -- they all want me to sign papers .
tell me , just what you know of dr. meirschultz .
hm -- pressure -- to buckley . that 's all right . we 'll talk later .
no , no ! i wo n't sign any pa- pers . you ca n't make me --
i do n't know -- i ca n't tell --
why , yes , to you , mr. -- mr. -- what ?
you -- a friend to me ?
no , i do n't want money . i only want to find out who you are and where you live . my business is finding peo- ple . not taking their money .
maybe you want my money , too .
who wants your money -- maybe i can help you .
no -- i do n't want to give any money . everybody wants money -- i 'm not going to give any money .
what made you steal ? are you hungry ?
i do n't know , [ i tell you ] .
who are you ? what is your name ?
no-
why did n't you notify the police ?
i know i am . why , i even heard a shot up there last night .
maybe you 're right .
it may be , but to my notion , those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later .
that sounds to me very remarkable .
sure -- they 're sorta queer , i 'd say . they 's lots of queer goings on up there . they even brought a dog back to life once .
by the way -- did you hear a shot last night ?
oh , him . he has a cat of his own . but his assistant -- he 's the cat-hatenest man i ever saw . goofy , if ya ast me . ]
you 're not as quick as i thought . i figgered out that rats breed faster than cats -- cat skins make good fur -- the cats eat rats . rats eat raw meat . that is , they eat the carcasses of the cats . so -- the cats eat the rats -- the rats eat the cats . and i get the skins -- simple ai n't it ?
but where do the rats come in ?
that 's it . you get it quick .
oh , i see . cats ' fur .
oh , no . it 's my own idea . i 'm in the business . in the fur business .
what ' s the idea [ of wanting so many ] do you sell them [ to the doctor ] ?
sure , got thousand cats , too . look at 'em -- points to cages of cats .
thousands ?
yeah -- thousands , and right in my back yard .
[ lot of ] how many cats you have -- what 's the matter -- rats ?
he 's been stealing my cats to experiment on [ them ] . i know cause i 've been [ watching ] spying on him .
i understand from your neighbors that all [ them ] cats are making noise at night . dr. meirschultz has put in a complaint .
come on , we 're wasting time .
oh , < u > i 'm < /u > crazy , am i ? let me tell you something . those women have -- the gleam --
man , you 're crazy . what kind of a place is this ?
it wo n't do any good . they are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out .
take me down there .
oh , nothing . a cou- ple of my patients having a little argument .
what 's that ?
oh , nothing . he is crazy , that 's all . i had a little trouble with him .
yes . mr. buckley thinks you treated him a little rough . he 's in the hospital . how about it ?
you here again ?
i 'd like to have a look .
oh , just the basement . some day i intend to build an experimental laboratory down there . it will save me from intrusion .
what 's down there ?
mind if i look around ? seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments . sure of himself but taking no chances . maxwell sure , i 'll take you thru .
oh no . mostly research in endocrinology .
do you have many patients , doctor ?
fine . mrs. buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea .
oh , yes , he 's in good hands now .
yes indeed . he has been a < u > difficult < /u > case . now that < u > you < /u > have him in custody -- you have him have n't you ?
so -- that 's it . buckley took the body .
why , buckley stole that body . that 's what alarmed mrs. buckley so . i have been try- ing to get her to put buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him .
yeah , he was picked up -- also the body from the morgue . say , what did you have to do with stealing that body ?
well , news of buckley ?
how do you do .
oh , maxwell ? he 's left .
by the way , where < u > is < /u > your assistant ?
you found buckley ?
i 'm detective jones . just dropped in to tell you a bit of news .
oh , so you feel that way too . motions to other room . stay in there -- i 'll call you when needed .
it sounds all right , except for the fact that she 's crazy . it seems to me she has the right idea -- .
[ something very important . i have been threatened ; ] mrs. maxwell , my assistant 's wife , is crazy . she thinks i mur- dered her husband . [ she wants to murder me . ] i want you to help me quiet her -- give her a shot from this hypo . [ keep it hid till we get her ] down in the basement -- there is a secret vault [ there ] . we will put her there till we get your husband -- [ then turn her over to the authorities . then we will both be free . ]
how ? what can i do ?
you are right . but before i can get him back here , you will have to help me .
not so fast , mrs. buckley . that was your idea !
you ca n't double-cross me like that . you were to help me . you were to operate on him . you were going to put him under my power .
no , you ca n't do that -- they 'll get suspicious --
i 'm going to call the police .
what are you going to do ?
he is n't here .
dr. meirschultz , please .
nonsense ! ... it 's here ! ... your blood ...
yes !
you 're losing your blood ?
i 'm losing my blood !
what is it now ?
go to sleep !
the wound is bleeding !
what is it ?
the master ... is asleep !
yes !
your father ?
what did it say ?
that called ... commanded ...
that spoke to you ?
a voice ...
what were you dreaming about ?
no ! good night !
no ?
there 's no child here , and no dogs either .
but ... the dogs ...
there 's no child here .
yes .
the child !
yes , the child ...
did you hear ?
the blood transfusion is completed . while marc himself is looking after the patient , the nurse leads nikolas into an adjoining room , where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage . the doctor stands bending over lone .
another fragment of the diary is shown [ having to do with vampires ] .
the blood transfusion continues . marc has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp , so that he can see nikolas in bright light , while he himself sits in the dark . nikolas watches lone 's face anxiously and closely during her struggle with death . life slowly seems to return to her , and her breathing becomes more peaceful . she opens her eyes and looks at the people round her , but she is much too enfeebled to speak , and closes her eyes again . marc keeps a close watch on nikolas , who grows paler and paler . his eyes swivel slowly from nikolas to the patient and back to nikolas again .
joseph is reading the diary , which arouses his interest more and more . it is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him . an extract from the diary is shown .
the blood transfusion is now in progress . the only words are curt orders like : 'now ! - quickly ! - that 's enough ! - give it to me ! - sit still ! ' etc .
joseph returns from the room where gisle is . he has evidently succeeded in calming her . he goes and sits in the chair where nikolas sat . he rests his head in his hand . he sees the open diary and begins reading it .
by the time we return there , all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed .
it 's igor at the wax museum ! you 'll find your judge embalmed in wax ! he 's a statue of voltaire , with all the other corpses ! the whole place is a morgue -- do you hear ? -- a morgue !
you lie !
no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight .
but you were in on it -- you worked for him .
no -- i did n't . it was igor at the waxworks .
you killed him ! come on with the rest of it . you killed him !
well , thank goodness , that 's settled .
i think so .
yeah , but they leave you plenty .
if you 're going to be indiscreet , i wish you 'd be a little more discreet about it . rich men , like winton , love you and leave you .
no ? give me a chance , baby . money is music in my ears , and when his old man kicks off there 'll be a million dollar tune .
you would n't get mixed up with that little rotter , would you ?
i 'm hungry . i 'll eat the first child i see . and i 've an appointment with young winton at 8:30 .
what 's the rush ? there 's no first act . they 'll all be there and we do n't have to appear at any particular time .
ouch ! eat ? you can do a solo if you do n't step on it . i 'm going to bow out on you .
why did n't you eat last night ?
i ca n't convince the inner woman that we can wait . she 's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies . i 've only had a cup of coffee since last night .
there 's no hurry . it 's early .
i 'll have it for supper . so long .
but what about lunch ?
then marry ralph ... you 'll be the happiest couple in the world .
you think money is the only requisite . it happens that the poor people are happier .
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough .
you would .
all right , you raise the kids -- i 'll raise the roof . i 'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers , than expire in a pan of dirty dish water .
i do n't agree with you .
i 've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i 've never hit one with dough . this love-in-an-attic is n't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon .
i do n't think you could have a real affair . you could n't care for anyone .
i do n't have any affairs . what do you mean ?
in the can . the hoosegow ! mrs. winton 's little boy . the pawk avenue wintons , you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi . he 's in the jail-house now ...
did you ? where ?
i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria .
i do n't see any big-moneyed boys running after you .
i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you did n't have the rent , but ralph is awful sweet .
what are you laughing at ?
i wish you would n't be so sarcastic about ralph . he 's the sweetest kid i know .
i wondered . did he invite you to lunch , or did you invite him ?
yes , why ?
i 'm glad you told me . good night , mr. burton .
that 's the way i feel about it .
so that 's the way it is ?
well , that 's just how stupid i am . when you go riding , it will be with me . and if it 's with someone else , you can make it a permanent arrangement .
i 'd call it stupid at any time .
you would n't have said that before you met her .
i 'm not quarreling , only ...
are we going to have the same quarrel over again ?
do n't kid yourself -- she means it .
she thinks it 's funny to talk the way she does , but --
well , i do say it .
i wo n't let you say that !
what 's nice about her ? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger .
nonsense . she 's one of the nicest girls i know .
she is n't anybody 's friend , and i do n't like you living with her . she 's a bad influence .
but why ? she 's the best friend i 've got .
delighted , i 'm sure .
why , certainly , sir . my fiance . charlotte , may i present mr. igor .
well , you see , the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule . all of his advertising announced the opening tonight .
disappoint me ? why , what do you mean , dear ?
and i have no desire to hurt you . you will always be beautiful . think , my child , in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now .
please , oh , please , i have n't done anything to hurt you .
ralph ! ralph !
we have found immortality , you and i. you must not be afraid .
let me go ! let me go !
it is no trouble at all , my child . this is the strange , vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create . my footing is not too secure .
oh , please , mr. igor , i 'm terribly ashamed . i should n't have put you to so much trouble .
i 'd love to .
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you . let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him , especially if it is your fault ... while you 're waiting for your friend , would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs ?
but it was really my fault .
oh , you children , you happy children . you 've quarreled and now you 're going to be friends again . and that is as it should be . never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you .
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph . we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind .
oh ! so , my little friend , you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night .
oh ! mr. igor ! -- i 'm so glad you 're here -- i do n't know why i should be , but i was a little bit afraid .
they are . my boy , i think you are right . everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country , i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself . you can call that fellow in from the front . i think we 'll close for the night .
but i think these things are beautiful .
at any time . you will always be welcome .
we 'll be coming to the opening .
i 'd love to , at any time .
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born . before this terrible thing happened to me ... ... i made a very beautiful statue . even if i had not met with this disaster , i could never have hoped to do anything finer , probably nothing quite so fine . and , my child , you are that figure come to life . i wonder , some time , would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work ?
thank you .
if you will forgive this poor , crippled stump , my dear , i am very happy to know you .
nothing doing . this is my percentage . you birds are going to get yours . and anyhow , i found this dump .
hey , what do you think you 're doing ? put that stuff back !
i do n't know what he was , but he made frankenstein look like a lily !
you mean he was colored ?
not a very good one , i guess . he was n't like anything human . he hobbled and swayed like a monkey , and the face , from the glimpse i got of it in the light from the street , was like an african war mask .
how quaint . but i can go any place you can .
it happens that i 'm the law .
whatever you are , you 're the only one of it .
what do you think i am ?
listen , copper , get a load of this . while you 're chinning yourself on a bar rail , i run down this story ... my story . consider yourself my assistant .
do n't take my word for it . get down there yourself and give a look .
are you giving me this straight ?
i 'm not kidding . joan gale 's body is packed in the box in the basement , and i saw the most horrible thing down there .
hello , express . what 's the idea , trying to outsmart the police ?
the body of joan gale !
what ! what are you talking about ?
i 'm going to get even with you , you dirty stiff ! i 'll do it !
that 's what i said .
yes , you could . cut out this rotten business and act like a lady . marry me .
listen , stupid , could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval ?
i 'm going to make you eat dirt , you soap bubble ! i 'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go !
what goofy idea have you got now ? do n't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body .
was there any art on judge ramsey ?
go on , little girl , take your troubles somewhere else . i do n't feel like talking to you .
say , you 're always razzing everything i do , but this is one time i 'm in .
what do you mean -- haywire ? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers . you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games . you 're grand ! i 'm for you ! stupendous !
this one 's a story , but i 'm not going to tell you what it is . every time i tell you anything it goes haywire .
you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness ?
mit me , kid . i 've got a classic .
almost ! i 'll still bet i 'm right , and let you write your own ticket .
almost certain .
no kiddin ' ?
that dear , innocent judge ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in south america .
what do you mean ?
oh , by the way , another pet theory of yours just blew up .
all right , master mind . but there 's something cockeyed about that joint and i 'm going to find out what it is .
come down to earth . do you think they would dare do anything like that ? do n't you think they 'd know that figure would be recognized ? shake your head real hard -- you 'll be all right .
let it go .
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it .
and it came to life and divorced you . i know all about that . now my idea is this : somebody swipes the girl 's body , takes impression , makes a mold , produces wax figure ... bingo ! ... peddles it to this old skate down there !
i used to be married to one .
listen , jo-jo . does this mean anything to you ? joan gale 's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask ?
about the gale girl , i mean . where do we go from there ? what of it ?
what !
we 'll grant that .
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they have n't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up , then i 'm crazy .
no kiddin ' . what 's your idea ?
all right , you poor baboon , you can guess the rest of it !
well , you ca n't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that .
i asked you to keep your trap shut !
now do n't that call for an extra !
jim , there 's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street .
all right , wise guy . go ahead . spill it .
listen , jim -- and if you wisecrack while i 'm talking i 'll crown you with the inkwell .
well , no one would ever suspect it . you do n't sound right .
i am right ! i know i 'm right !
so you can give me an argument and tell me i 'm wrong . do n't be sil , kid .
well , why so mysterious ! come on , spill it .
hey , mattie , dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on joan gale .
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale .
come in , prussic acid . what 's on your mind ?
get out of here .
which one is me ? the horse ?
sleep on it ... we 'll get it tomorrow .
no , there 's another point i want to iron out .
great ! ... if he 's worthless we 'll give him away as a bridge prize . come on -- beat it . it 's five o'clock . you need some sleep .
on the square , jimmy , if you 'd seen winton down there -- i 'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he 's a dirty pup , but he 's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
nope , i 'm through !
hey , come here , sob-sister !
all right , you said i was fired . well , i quit ! give the assignment to somebody else .
you can not . i 'm still editor of this sheet .
well , that 's got nothing to do with this case . can i handle this my way ?
whooey -- he took a run-out powder .
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him .
except that he disappeared when things got too hot .
and they never proved anything against him .
oh , you wo n't -- you were pretty tough about judge ramsey -- a little while ago --
well , i wo n't work on it from that angle .
you do n't think he 'd be sap enough to do the job himself . i hope they give him the works . even if he did n't kill the kid , he 's responsible for her death , and they can fry him any time without making me sore .
well , anyway , he could n't have copped that body -- he was in jail .
i 'm glad to hear it . when did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice ? this lousy mug , with all the money in the world , has had two or three nasty affairs . he 's kept out o ' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the indians .
you give me a pain !
he 's getting a break , ai n't he ? he 's front page .
no , i mean it . i think this kid 's entitled to a break .
and ruin a perfectly good story ? do n't be silly .
i would n't be trying , beloved . i would hang him ! and another thing , all this gaga about the body disappearing . eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months . does n't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle ?
why the goose pimples ? if he was n't social register -- if it was somebody like me , you 'd be trying to hang him .
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker , they would n't have pinched him . but he 's george winton and they 're playing him up . it 's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york .
well , ai n't that a shame . nice little chappie that would n't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow .
quick , watson , the cookbook !
that is none of our business . but you bring me something for the next edition if it 's only a recipe for spaghetti !
and how does one go about getting these human documents , may i inquire ?
well , is it my fault if nothing happens ?
all right , what about it ? we get out a paper just the same . did you ever stop to think of that ?
what do you mean , you poor ham ! this is new year 's !
i 'm through clowning . you 're all washed up . get out !
that you 're a sure bet to place in the bread line . there 's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental . you 're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it .
meaning what ?
great . consider yourself crippled -- financially . see if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on .
charming . more delightful people crippled .
yeah . have a pleasant vacation ?
where did you get the news item ? from a little bird ?
been doing experiments with scotch and soda again ?
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince .
well , maybe it was . i do n't remember . you got to do something for me , i ca n't stand it any longer -- i ca n't !
you used to go to worth 's place a whole lot . what makes you sure it was n't there ?
no , sir , i 'm sure it was n't there .
you did n't happen to be going to worth 's place , did you ?
no , sir . about three months ago .
do n't remember what day that was , do you ?
i do n't remember . not so very far --
where were you going when you got in that cab ?
yes , sir . i got in the cab and it was layin ' there on the floor .
thanks .
it 's all yours .
do n't give this to anybody else , will you ?
there 's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately . you better skip over there .
make it snappy , colonel .
hotcha ! saved , one job !
nothing . only she may have tried to blackmail him . you know such things have happened . anyway , he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead .
what does that prove ?
why would i string y ' ? they were sweeties until a month ago .
say , if you 're stringin ' me , old-timer ...
do n't they ? he 's down at the tombs right now .
they do n't suspect < i > him < /i > ?
that 's the one .
old howard winton 's cub ?
do you know george winton ?
no foolin ' -- any suspect ?
oh , yeah ? maybe she did n't commit suicide . she may have been murdered !
yes , she committed suicide yesterday . that 's not news . i heard about it last year .
i 've got a story for you . you know the joan gale girl ?
i 've got to make news , if i have to bite a dog . hey , kelly ! oh , mi gosh , even he walked out on me .
no kiddin ' .
i 'm people which the old year saw out . i 'm canned , fired !
fine . you 're the first reporter in here for two hours . you people seeing the old year out ?
how 's every little thing ?
call the homicide squad !
here 's a wow .
stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner 's banquet , and he says , bring me a yarn . all i have to do is get a story .
i told you he was a sore .
ai n't that something . the mad monk of manhattan . here goes nothing . listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion .
listen , flo , cut it out . hard-tack is pretty sore .
plain-clothes man . come on , slaves , drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death .
what do you mean police dog ?
he 's not a stag hound . his name is kelly and he 's a police dog .
where 'd you get the stag hound ?
better cut that out . that 's what happens to girls who bite their nails . what 's wrong ?
ralph , come here a minute , will you ?
no . i wanted to do it without saying anything . i think he 's worth it .
gee , that 's great . after the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue . this will pep him up . have you told him about it ?
well , i 'll tell you a secret . i kinda like the old gent and i 'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him . it might help him a whole lot . but that 's a side issue -- something i do on my own time .
i guess so . but would n't it be better for you to wait until the old man 's here ?
i 'm after news , as usual . i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory ?
what are you people doing out in the middle of the night ?
horsefeathers !
nix , flo -- he wo n't let you in and you 'll only get me in dutch .
who ? old santa claus there ? that 's easy for anyone with my sex appeal . he 's a pushover . watch me stand that old dodo on his ear .
no use . he 's a crab , i tell you .
he might get some publicity out of it .
do n't worry -- she 'll get used to it .
gee , honey-bunch , i 'm sorry -- i 'm going to have to disappoint you .
fine , thanks .
do n't ask any questions . come on !
what is it ? what happened ?
well , that being the case , i 'll take it up with the board of directors . hey , listen , aviator , here we are !
heaven knows . a lot .
how much money have you got ?
you do n't believe me . you think i 'm just talking . will you marry me ?
oh , is that what caused it ?
no , really -- i 'm crazy about you .
it does n't usually take that long , but i 'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you .
i suppose this is going to sound absurd . i 've only known you twenty-four hours , but i 'm in love with you .
-- and so determined to live that i 'm going to get out and take a taxi if you do n't watch where you 're going .
darned if i do n't !
you go in for dangerous things .
why ?
no -- no -- i -- i -- i do n't want to see it .
there she is ! you 'll find joan gale in that box .
i told you what to do . drive around the corner out of sight of the house . i want to get a closer look at the place .
please . i 'm sorry . i 'll see it through . what do you want me to do ?
all right , brother . then you can go to some nice warm place , and i do n't mean california .
i told you i did n't want to mix in it .
what ! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story ? not so you could notice it ! now , look , i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me .
not even then . the police are the proper people to conduct this affair . now if you 've got any suspicions i 'll drive you to the nearest police station .
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health ?
now look here . it 's not up to us to do our own detective work . i 've had enough trouble over this matter . i do n't want anything more to do with it .
that 's what they 're going to ask you .
who 'd steal her body ?
that happens to be the truth .
then why are you telling me a crazy lie ? ...
hold on , hold on . i 'm trying to help you , if you 're on the square , and i think you are .
stolen ! what are you trying to do to me ? ... you 're working with the police ! ... you 're trying to make me say something that can be used against me ! you 're trying ...
well , let 's get back to the case in hand . they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue .
no . why did n't i take her out somewhere ? but she was laughing and seemed so happy .
you were n't going with her ?
we planned a trip for her . i was going to send her to bermuda .
i see . was that all she said ?
she laughed and told me that we were being silly , that we did n't care for each other any more but we need n't hate each other ... ... she said she wanted to be friends .
uh-huh . do you remember what she said ? what did you talk about ?
they did n't give me a chance . we had a couple of drinks and she was all right then . she seemed happy .
hmmm . why did n't you tell that to the police ?
for a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
your dad has stood for plenty . now let 's get down to cases . when did you see the dale girl last ?
my lawyers will be on the job in a little while , and i warn you people anything you print about me you 've got to prove . dad wo n't stand for --
that 's what i said .
cry-baby ?
listen , kid . you 're in a tough spot , and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
yes , sure , that 's fine . while i 'm proving my innocence , you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick i ever did ... you 're going to write editorials about every cocktail i ever drank . anything that any sane , normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning , if i did it . go on ! get out ! i do n't want to talk to you !
come on , old man , that wo n't do . you know you 're innocent until proven guilty .
yeah . i suppose you people will crucify me for something i did n't do . i did n't ! you understand that ! ... i did n't do it ! she -- tried before --
good night . and i am very grateful to you .
good night , sir .
it will always afford me great pleasure to see you .
i regret i ca n't spend the time i 'd like with your exhibition , but i 'm going to worry the life out of you when i come back .
you will have won the undying gratitude of us all . is that not so , marie antoinette ?
she will undoubtedly keep her promise . if you 'll grant me the privilege , i 'd like to submit this work to the royal academy when i get back .
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber , immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london . at such times marie antoinette has reassured me , she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her .
even those delicate veins , the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite .
you are too gracious . these things have some merit , i suspect ... but this -- ... i am convinced , is fine .
not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done .
you 're insane .
well , what do you think i 'm in this for ? think of it , man , a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us !
and they are welcome to them . to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes .
you 've got to permit it ! whose fault is it that no one comes here ? the museum at walston lane does well enough , and why ? they 've got jack the ripper , burke and hare , the mad butcher , the demon barber of fleet street and things people pay to see .
and you think i will permit this , my friend ?
i 'm not asking you anything . i 'm telling you what i 'm going to do !
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking ? ...
i want the money back i 've thrown into this rubbish heap .
a fire ! is this your idea of humor , my friend ?
yes , there 's our way out . a fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds .
fire insurance !
no -- i 'm lying to amuse myself ! now look here , i 've an idea that will get us out of all this . we have n't twopence between us , but we 've got these .
is that a fact ?
something important has got to come of it ! do you know that the rent on this place is n't paid ?
your money may have been well invested , my friend . something important may come of all this .
that is unfortunate .
i came back for some of the books . i am trying to straighten out the accounts . i do n't hope to impress you , but i may as well tell you : we have n't a farthing !
quite so . quite so . and you , my little friend , my little marie antoinette . it is kind of you to be present .
i would n't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight , mr. igor . the weather was against you , and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow .
all right , i 'll tell them . they 're right here in front .
if you leave before the work is done , you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good .
i will only be gone about half an hour .
that is unfortunate . they will have to wait .
but i have some friends waiting .
to lunch , you say . i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in . we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening .
to lunch .
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that do n't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose . anatomy ! heaven forgive you . you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks !
but the composition as a whole -- i 've tried to keep a sketchy freedom .
everything , my friend . and you hope to be a great sculptor -- a great sculptor . look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long .
that does n't seem so bad to me . what is wrong with it ?
and he is n't struck dead ! this man , he lives ! it would be interesting to know , young man , where and when you studied anatomy .
one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group .
if my curiosity is not too great , would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing ?
do n't lose sight of him . this is the most important thing in my life .
i 'd know him anywhere .
he ca n't hear you .
what are you laughing at ?
i wonder if i could have her pose for me .
she is the soul of that statue .
you have done well , and now i , too , have something for you . come .
i 'd be glad to , mr. igor . i think i 'll have somethin ' to tell you soon .
yes .
shall we unpack it ?
otto ! you and one of those other fellows ! come help professor darcey .
yes , sir , it 's here on the truck , but it 's pretty heavy -- i 'll need help .
have you got it ? is it completed ?
thanks .
well , any time i can do anything for you --
they did n't have a leg to stand on . there 's no case against me . it 's a clumsy thing to have happen , but nothing to worry about .
i 'm glad they did n't hold you downtown .
good . well , i 'll be seeing you .
yep . everything settled .
yes ... .
mia ... ?
what was her name ? the one i met .
excuse me ? ? ?
what was her name ?
-- what if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor ? what then ? what did your life mean ? who did you nurture , pauly ? who did you love ?
you did miss --
spare me your classical answer . measurements in . results taken . what if i did n't miss ?
you did .
two : what if i did n't miss ?
dad ...
do n't waste it pauly . this is not an everyday talk . just input the information and ask relevant questions . one : how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particular switching station ?
you taking any medication ?
to isolation . to an armed camp . to a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son .
so i can move on . you too .
why ?
what ?
then you get it . you 'll understand .
i 've been dreaming about this .
wait . i want to tell you something .
i did n't want to leave things the way we did . not this time .
and glow happily ever after .
that they tunnel , magically , through any obstacle , defying the practical laws of physics , in order to end up together --
dysfunctional --
a five hundred foot thick steel wall . but the connection between these two electrons is so --
she 's in l.a. , he 's in the bay area --
inside every semi-conductor ... you have two particles , with opposite charges , separated by an impassable barrier ...
no . i did n't . i 'm listening .
like now ?
that 's what it asked me . `` what do you want ? '' i did n't answer . i was in the middle of an experiment .
what did it want ?
god . i dunno . the eternal nothingness . mia .
of what ?
how ?
the buddhists have been saying that for a millennium .
nothing is real until it 's perceived .
a quantum one .
what universe are you in , paul ?
could be .
at the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . they connect in unimaginable ways .
we flopped the first time out .
it 's an experiment .
why am i doing this ?
that 's the physicist 's playground .
a place you 've never been .
where to ?
could you ?
i could go out of town .
what ?
okay .
i 'm heading out of town .
could we go somewhere ?
day or night ?
i 've been dreaming about you .
i said she is n't here . now you go home . be a nice boy and go home .
where is she ?
she is n't here . and i 'm sorry , but mr. hillyer does n't want her to have callers during working hours .
well , i got to see her .
she must have gone out for a walk with the children .
is rose here ?
yes ?
this is n't punishment , i do n't believe in punishment . it 's for your health . obviously you 're sick if you can act like that .
oh , mother , not the castor oil .
i do n't think you are sufficiently in awe of it . get the castor oil .
i am in awe of it , mother .
but we must respect that power , we must be in awe of it .
i know , mother .
sex is n't ugly , sex is one of the most beautiful things in life , the creative power of the universe is behind it .
they 're filthy , mother .
buddy , sex do n't mean a thing to me . it ai n't nothin ' but a mosquito bite . i 'll tell you a secret . girls do n't want sex , buddy , girls want love .
maybe it was eating all those rabbits that made you sexy , rose .
a saint just like your own mother . she 's up in heaven right now , her and lunette , there ai n't no doubt about it .
what was your mother like ?
boy did i get sick of rabbit . but later on after momma died and daddy was n't doin ' nothin ' but drinkin ' , i sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew . you know , i ought n't to of told you about what daddy done when i was a child . until them rabbits ruined him , he was a real good man , buddy .
well , that doctor said you got protein somewhere and i guess he was right .
he thought he could sell 'em , but nobody but country folks eat rabbits , buddy , and they ai n't got no money . we had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves . every dern one , and it took about four years to eat 'em all up .
how did the rabbits kill him ?
yep , we had 'em in orange crates all over . it was daddy 's dream . he was goin ' to get rich raisin ' rabbits . it was what killed daddy . he did n't drown hisself till a long time later after momma and lunette died of typhoid , but it was them rabbits what killed him .
five hundred rabbits ?
did you know when i was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits ?
they 're dumb things . i got tired of them .
i guess i 'll work as a waitress , buddy . i done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know , but i ca n't stay here no more . why did you get rid of your rabbits , buddy ?
take a little walk with me , huh ?
what are you going to do , rose ?
makin ' homes for purple martins , huh ? we had 'em on the farm . they 're the prettiest things . that 's what i wish i was , a bird . just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun .
okay .
hi , buddy . how 's my sweetheart who never told on me when i was bad ?
i do n't want to know ...
i got ta find out what they 're saying . you lie back and rest , rose , and i 'll give you a report on it .
buddy , i 'm scared , i 'm scared !
you wo n't die , rose .
oh , buddy , they 're gon na cut me all up ! they 're gon na cut my stummick all open , i 'll die !
i ai n't neither . listen here , buddy , besides all his vast medical knowledge , he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he 's got some real interestin ' ideas .
rose , you are just entirely too uncritical of people .
well , i like him . i used to be afraid of doctors but not any more . why , he could operate on me any old time and i would n't even be scared .
yeah , i 'd believe it .
he 's got doubts about hisself and that 's the saddest thing of all . would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him ?
rose , i have got doubts about that doctor and so does daddy .
yeah , he tried to hide it but i saw 'em , and a little bit he says to me , `` you know , you are beautiful . '' now was n't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient , was n't it ? what could cheer a girl up more ?
he did ?
you do n't know the bedside manner that man has got . why , it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin ' in his bag like he 's gon na cure me , which he did of course . and even more important he loves me , like a patient i mean , the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin ' to my heart beat .
rose , you are too uncritical of people .
oh , he 's so kind , so gentle inside , and so unhappy with that rich wife who does n't understand him , her being a southerner and everything , and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts !
but i do n't know who they are .
rose , if you do n't keep your boyfriends away from the house , daddy is going to fire you .
i got an awful toothache .
well , he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day . but i do n't know who he is , buddy , i really do n't .
rose , you must know who the fellow is .
you 're my sweetheart .
yeah .
did your momma really give you castor oil ?
i have a knack for designing clothes . but i had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook .
here comes daddy .
buddy , mr. right is out there somewhere and i 'm gon na find him !
you 're going to get yourself up and go out ?
well , ill tell you this . i have learned a lesson tonight . i was n't gon na run around , but when i start botherin ' your daddy and worse robbin ' a cradle , i got ta face the facts of life . tomorrow mornin ' , i 'm gon na get myself up and go out .
oh , buddy , you do love me ! i knew you did , knew it all the time ...
rose , they could stick splinters under my fingernails , and i will never say a word ! i will never tell them , because ... i love you !
buddy , i have to ask you , as bad as i 've been please have pity on me and do n't ruin me by telling them what i did . i know it was bad , it was bad and dumb . but mostly it was dumb , i did n't mean you no harm , i 'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that 's the truth . i love you . but they 'd think i did , they 'd think i was awful , they 'd despise me and hate me ...
i said i would n't .
i hate to turn on this light , you daddy 's awake downstairs , but i have to take the chance . buddy , please do n't tell on me .
good night , rose .
i sure hope you do n't . i got ta get outta here , good night .
do n't worry , rose , i wo n't tell a soul .
buddy , you would n't tell nobody , would you ?
no . no , i 'm all right . oh , god , what have i done ? i have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell ! i must be crazy , a child like you . oh , god , oh , lord . this is awful , this is terrible , i got ta get outta here !
rose , are you all right ? are you sick or something ?
you would n't understand . oh , god , i must be outta my mind . what would your momma think ?
but why , if i 'm not hurting you ?
no . no , you 're not hurting me . but i think you better quit it .
am i hurting you ?
i must be outta my mind . buddy , quit it .
but rose ...
you better quit that .
well , nothin ' .
i 'm thirteen . and i have a natural curiosity . it 's only nature , rose , that 's all . now what 's wrong with nature , huh ?
buddy , you 're just a child .
yes , i do . please , rose , be a good sport .
well , you 're sweet , but you do n't really love me .
please , rose . i 'm curious , that 's all , i have a natural curiosity , it 's only human . you 're my friend , are n't you ? do n't you like me ? i like you , rose , a lot -- in fact , i love you .
of course you ca n't ! i 'm ... i 'm shocked at you , buddy , real shocked ! now you be quiet or i 'm going back to my own bed !
ca n't i touch it a little , rose -- not a lot , just a little ?
no ! you ought to be ashamed of yourself astin ' such a nasty things a child your age !
yeah , but satisfaction brought him back . can i ?
well , now that is just too bad ! curiosity killed the cat .
i 'm curious to see what it 's like . i 'm very curious , rose .
why , buddy , shut your mouth ! what an awful thing to say , and where did you get any such idea as that , anyhow ?
rose , since you 're here in bed with me and everything and i 've already touched your titty ...
most men would n't do what he done . if they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- i guess to hell they do , just like a dern rabbit . 'course later they 'll tell her she 's no good when they done the same thing their selves . they 're a bunch of monkeys . i like 'em , but they 're a bunch of monkeys .
rose , i have a serious favor to ask you .
there ai n't none in your daddy . you know , what happened has just made me love him all the more . i not only love him , i respect him , i admire him .
there 's an evil streak in everybody , rose .
you know , buddy , sometimes i ca n't figure you out at all . you can be very nice , but like your mother said there 's an evil streak in you .
well , some fiend might .
who would want to do such a thing as that ?
it was softer'n i thought , that was my main impression . you know , if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot .
do n't mention it .
that was very interesting . thank you , rose .
all right , that 's enough . you 're just a child and would n't understand it , but that type of thing can stir a girl up . now lie back and we 'll talk .
first i could n't feel it , but now i feel it easily , it 's like a little acorn .
'course it does .
hmmph . it has a nipple , all right .
well , are you satisfied now ? can we just lie and talk , huh ?
aw , be a good sport , rose . you like me , do n't you ? i like you a lot .
you don ' t need to know that . it 's none of your business .
aw , come on , rose , i want to see what the nipple on it is like .
buddy , you do n't realize it but what you 're doing is n't nice .
just for a second . please , rose , what 's the harm ?
but i 'm curious , rose .
buddy , what 's come over you ? a child like you , askin ' such things .
rose , ca n't i see what the nipple on it is like ?
no , you ca n't . and i 'll tell you this -- he scares me . as kind as he is , he scares me . you ca n't fool around with him , not with that man . and , boy , i sure better not try nothin ' like that with him again , he 'll fire me .
can i put my hand inside your nightgown , rose ?
you know , that daddy of yours is the funniest man , the things he says , you never know what 's going to come out of his mouth next .
actually , i am , though .
buddy , quit that , you 're just a child , you 're not supposed to be interested in such things .
there 's some kind of gristle in it , though .
ha ha ha , that 's some idea , a cantaloupe .
well , i thought they were more like a cantaloupe .
what did you expect ?
hmmm , it 's soft . it 's awful soft .
i fell madly in love with him when he called me rosebud . you know that first day when i come and he said i looked graceful like a capital letter s and called me rosebud ? i fell madly in love with that man right then . but it 's a lost love , buddy . he 's a good man and wo n't have nothin ' to do with me .
but , rose , how could such a thing as that happen ?
promise not to tell doll ? -- or nobody ? buddy , it 's your daddy ! i 'm so much in love with him i am out of my mind !
but , rose , what is the cause of it all ?
why , it has just made me ill , buddy . i 'm sick . i do n't want to eat nothin ' , i do n't , and me i got a good appetite , that ai n't nat'ral for me . i 'm ill .
you were pretty bad , huh ?
buddy , i was horrible . i ca n't tell you who it was , but do you know what i did ? i sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know , a child like you . why , i let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and i let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers ... but to get back serious to what i was sayin ' , it is not only , buddy , the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so ...
what 'd you do , rose ?
it 's so terrible i ca n't tell you . oh , buddy , you do n't know how it hurts to have a broken heart , what a terrible feeling it is , and i 've had a broken heart so many times . men , i do n't understand them , i ca n't figure them out and they break my heart , that 's all . i ca n't find mr. right , buddy , i ca n't find him no matter how hard i look , all i find is a whole pile of mr. wrongs . but this is the worst ever because it was n't his fault . it was my fault , oh yes , my fault , i was bad -- oh god , i was bad , you would n't believe how bad i was .
what is it , rose ?
i thought i 'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to . as a child , i never had no room all to myself , we were awful poor . buddy ... i have got a confession to make .
well , all right .
buddy , i am wandering in a wilderness , lost . i just feel awful . do you mind if i get in bed with you for a little while ?
no , i 'm awake . what 's the matter ?
buddy , you are in one of your evil moods , i do n't want to talk to you . i 'm going out and sweep the patio .
well , it 's only the truth . there are horrible things in the world , rose .
i do n't hear you . i just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away .
he really did , he ate his little niece . he made pork chops out of her .
i did n't hear you . i did n't hear that .
there was this old man that ate his niece .
what terrible thing in cave springs ?
hey , rose , did you hear about that terrible thing down in cave springs ?
your daddy is a wonderful man , i 'll say that . he 's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world .
was that what they tried to do ? was that why daddy gave you the job , to save you from those scoundrels ?
did they try to induce you to become a prostitute ?
bad is bad , buddy . there ai n't no sense to it .
in what sense were they bad ?
they were just bad men , that 's all .
but who were they ?
nobody .
rose , who were those scoundrels in birmingham ?
sure . let me take your suitcase .
buddy . well , now , that 's a nice name , i like it . i am real pleased to meet you . hey , look , do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere ?
lots of things . buddy , mostly .
oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
of course not !
quiet , you little muddy-eyed brat , or ill kill you !
he did lie , and ... and ... and mother , yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook !
rose is madly in love with daddy ...
all right , what do you know ?
i do , too !
oh , waski , you do n't know anything .
yeah , i know .
i do , too .
oh , waski , you do n't even know what we 're talking about .
neither do i .
no , she has n't . i think i hear a car .
i heard you talking . has n't rose come in ?
she 's got somebody in there , brother ! his shoes are on the back porch -- there they were , naked and smiling at me ! rose , open this door immediately !
daddy , what 's the matter ?
open that door , damn you !
and there 's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into rose 's bedroom in the dark of night ! i am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it ! -- and that is not all i am going to do !
well ... maybe ...
see , son ? the paint is flaked off here , freshly . look at it , brother , there is no question about it . some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder .
true , but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder . now let 's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with .
well , i do n't know . no , i do n't know , daddy , i think the rain has obscured it .
well . well , what i mean is , you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him . but look this , brother , it is even more interesting . look at this mark here , and that mark over there . now would n't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder ?
but how would you find him ?
that is because it rained recently , the rain has obscured the evidence . but you could still take plaster casts of these footprints , then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are , and that way you could catch him -- understand ?
well , it 's not very plain .
see that , son ? now this is a heel , see , and there , that 's the ball of a foot . someone has been walking here .
he 's not coming back again . we scared the rascal off , son . come on back to supper . your mother has a theory about how to educate rose .
i do n't know . but you better watch him like a hawk , if he comes back again .
what do you think , brother ?
what 's taking the rascal so long ?
yeah , he 's still up there .
is that doctor still up there , brother .
the girl strikes like a cobra .
i do n't know .
i never saw anything like it . how did she pick him up so fast ?
no . why should rose be in my room ?
son , was rose in your room last night ?
well , yeah .
reading dirty comic bocks . and you admitted it ?
well , a little .
you were up late last night , brother .
i 'll be right back .
now i have a plan about rose , an educational plan . she 's getting better and we do n't want any more trouble -- brother , you ought to hear this .
excuse me , got ta go to bathroom .
i do wish you 'd speak to brother . it 's true he 's been looking at those horrible little books again .
heh , what a hypocrite .
oh , yes , it 's thursday . hello , rose , dear ... ... my , you 're ... looking pretty ...
she 's getting herself up to go out . i think she 's coming down the hall now .
what 'd you say , brother ?
she 's getting herself up to go out .
children , children ! be quiet , all of you ! the vibrations in this house are strange today . where 's rose , anyhow ?
yes , i did , mother . your hearing aid is n't working right . i said ahhh-dam stuff .
no , you did n't say that , brother .
i said ahhh-dam stuff .
what did you say , brother ?
uhhh , gahdam stuff !
stop gagging like that and putting on a show , and swallow it .
geccch , yehh , guhhhh !
this is for your own good . when you look at negative , destructive things like those little filthy comic books , you are sick . here , take this .
mother , cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil ?
oh , brother , i am so disappointed in you . you must n't look at those horrible things , they degrade the human image .
mother , i have to tell the truth . i was n't reading huckleberry finn , i was reading one of those little dirty comic books .
brother , when i have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you 're either sick or you were up very late last night . and you were n't reading huckleberry finn . i looked and its not in your room . now what were you doing ?
walked , in all that heat ? it 's a wonder she has n't got sunstroke . i 'll phone daddy and you go get doll baby and waski .
in the kitchen drinking all the ice water in glenville . she walked out here , she did n't go by the hotel .
all right , all right . doll and waski are upstairs taking their nap , you go get them and bring them down to the living room . where is the girl ?
you mean confirmed , mother . i did n't confirm it before . i would have had to confirm it previously , in order for it to be reconfirmed .
your impression is very reassuring , brother . of course she 's had troubles , poor thing , but i sensed that was that the girl was like and i 'm glad to have it reconfirmed .
she talks a great deal and smiles a lot . she 's very pretty , she has a real good figure . she 's very girlish or womanish , if you know what i mean . she would n't hurt anybody , this girl . she could n't .
wonderful . what 's she like , brother ? what is your impression of her ?
the new girl is here .
here comes daddy .
why is it taking so long ?
if it is n't a baby ... what is it ?
that 's the least of her troubles . rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up , she told me all about it .
a baby ... and she is n't even married .
rose says she 's goin ' to have a baby and she sure looks it , but i do n't think so .
what 's goin ' on ?
sense does n't mean anything to rose . but i think we 're on safe ground now . daddy chained up the ladder , whoever it is ca n't get in the house .
well , if she 's got any sense at all , she 'll listen to that .
doll , do n't ask childish questions .
buddy ... does rose really ... `` do it '' with all those boys and men ?
mother is struggling desperately . in fact she 's fighting like a tiger . but i do n't know , it 's close , it 's mighty close .
what 's happening ?
you better not snoop , daddy 'll kill you !
they 've been in there the longest kind of time . i ca n't stand it , i got ta find out what 's going on .
what is rose going to do ? where can she go ?
dumbness does n't concern her , doll . and neither does smartness . you see --
then why does she act so dumb ?
it is n't that she has n't got any sense , doll . her basic intelligence is probably above average , maybe quite a bit above average .
she has n't got any sense . in some ways , she 's awful dumb .
so am i .
buddy , i 'm worried about rose .
chattanooga . i had st. louis , missouri .
shut up , doll . i 'll cut your guts
no , mother , he 's lying ...
you know , buddy , sometimes you make me sick .
wonderful ? he kissed her and played with her titty , and i do n't see anything so great about that . he was probably afraid mother would come back early and catch him .
was n't daddy wonderful ? he wanted to kiss her some more and play with her , but he did n't , because he loves mother and all of us , and he loves rose , too . is n't he wonderful , is n't he great ?
you should n't watch such things , doll .
buddy , that was pretty snotty of you , pushing me away like that just when it was interesting .
buddy , that was my place .
she 's putting the titty back .
let me look . aww-rr ...
he had his hand on her titty .
is that all ?
he kissed her .
what are they doing , doll ?
buddy , this is amazing , you would n't believe it .
what are they doing ?
wow ! brrrother !
boy ! wow !
now i ca n't see . what are they doing ?
let me see !
he 's trying to get up -- good god , one of her titties is out !
ohhh-hh ... what 's happening now ?
this is my place and you ca n't have it .
i ca n't see , let me see ...
they 're discussing it .
i ca n't see . what are they doing , what 's happening ?
at least .
i think she 's gon na kiss him .
okay .
let 's go peep from the living room .
yeah .
there goes mother .
i get so irritated with daddy . he 's so dumb sometimes .
yeah .
she 's watching the car again ?
it 's really pitiful . she 's in bad shape .
no , he does n't . not really .
i think daddy suspects .
it 's pitiful . neither one of them know .
no .
daddy says rose is calm as lettuce . do you believe that , doll ?
oh , shut up , buddy .
rose is almost as sentimental as mother . if there 's one thing i ca n't stand it 's sentimentality . in chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder . he killed his wife with a black widow spider .
i 'm not blubbering .
now look , boy , get a grip on yourself . rose had a good life . she found her . right , did n't she ? she triumphed over everything , what are you blubbering about ?
that 's a hell of a thing to say . why , rose ?
nobody lives forever , boy . who 'd want to ?
why rose ? why rose , daddy ?
it 's true , son . the girl with the cornflower eyes is dead , she is no more ,
i ca n't believe it , daddy . i know it must be true , but i ca n't believe it .
i know . you loved her . so did i. it was an awful shock to me , too . an awful shock . rose was so alive it 's hard to believe .
well , you have knocked me for a hell of a loop , old man . a hell of a loop .
excuse me , i 'll be right back .
she was fifty-six , son . of course she did n't look it , nowhere near it . the cancer came back , i 'm afraid i fibbed about that . but it was very quick , son . she was in the hospital only two weeks , and the last week she did n't know anything .
but ... but how ? she was young ! rose was n't old !
i am afraid so , son . about a week ago . her husband phoned me , she had asked him to call me if anything happened .
dead , rose is dead ? you mean ... she died ?
no , son , she is dead .
all right , daddy . we have our drink , we 're out on the patio , you have prepared me for it . rose 's cancer has come back , has n't it ?
i 'm older than hell , boy . but this yankee whisky is mighty fine , i 'll say that .
it 's funny you would mention rose , i was thinking about her all the way up in the car . or maybe it is n't so funny .
not for long , boy . i 've outstayed my welcome already .
it always gives me a funny feeling to come home . dear old southland . gone . it 's all gone , daddy -- -- except you , you 're still here .
a wonderful woman , boy .
that 's what she would say herself .
at rest in the creative universe with mother , son .
you know , i do n't know this town any more . all this traffic , new buildings , prosperity ... where have the years gone , daddy ? where is the little town i knew as a boy ?
yes , i guess he did . he threw her away and it was the mistake of his life .
he did n't lose her , he threw her away .
yeah , i know , he was up here . it 's pitiful like you say . when he lost rose it ruined the man , it destroyed him totally when he lost rose .
you 're damn right it incensed me , the miserable bastard . he also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over washington . d.c .
um-hmm , and i suppose that incensed you ?
the pitiful son of a bitch said rose was a nymphomaniac .
no , it 's another thing . i was going to write you about it , but since you were coming down anyway i thought i 'd wait till you got here . what did dave wilkie have to say ?
is her husband sick or something ?
oh , no , no , she got all over that . rose is fine . let 's sit down , son .
what sad news ? did her cancer come back ?
oh , i heard from her , i got a letter from her , she 's fine . but there is some sad news .
what 's all this about rose ? what do you mean , you heard from her in a manner of speaking ?
dave wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband . it 's funny you would mention rose . did you hear from her ?
how could that be , son ?
of course i recall rose . in fact i 've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half .
got another twenty years in it , boy . by the way , son , do you recall rose , that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion .
good god , the way you live here . this place has n't been dusted since mother died . look at that goddamned refrigerator .
are they polar bears , too ?
yeah , they 're in the snow .
your wife and children are back in new hampshire in the snow ?
i can use a drink after the plane ride i had .
it 's yankee whisky to me .
it is n't yankee whisky , daddy , it 's scotch .
about as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave . good to see you , son . did you bring any of that yankee whisky with you ?
hello , daddy . how are you ?
well , you rascal , where 'd you come from ?
yes , we know her .
i think we both know her .
of course .
i have of course observed the girl in treating her .
please do .
then ... may i speak quite frankly with you , mr. hillyer ?
i am ahead of you .
go on , doctor .
first , about the girl 's history . evidently she 's been very promiscuous since early childhood , she has no control over her sexual impulses . furthermore , she is permanently barren , she ca n't have children .
go ahead , doctor , i think i am following you .
oh , it 's definitely better , beyond question . a fatherless child , an ignorant girl with no job , no money , no home . it 's fortunate , a blessing really , and a stroke of good luck for another reason i want to mention to you .
well , if it is n't malignant and she can get through the operation all right , it might be better than her really being pregnant . she does n't even know who the father might have been .
any major operation is dangerous . however , as we know from her previous illness , she 's a very strong girl .
well , it 's a disaster . i do n't know what to say , doctor , i am floored . how dangerous is the operation ?
that 's all i want to know . lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself . thank you , doctor , for your discourse , it was fascinating , no doubt .
the point is you do n't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits . she got protein somewhere , she 's a very strong girl and i think she 'll live ... despite the delay in medical treatment .
yes , i think so . he adores her , it 's almost pitiful the way he worships her . i just hope she is n't too much for him .
honey , he is mr. right .
well , yes , she 's happy . of course dave does n't have her life force , not at all . there is n't much furniture in his house , just a table and one or two chairs , whereas rose has furniture coming out of the windows .
well , thank god we are rid of her at last . and the best thing of all is that she 's happy . the little nut is happy , she found mr. right in the nick of time !
you know dave , his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died .
who ?
why , that looks like dave wilkie ,
i 'm afraid it 's my fault . i made her feel guilty this morning -- brother , what are you doing up ?
i do n't understand it . even in the wild days she was never as late as this .
it 's twenty after one .
fine .
how is she ?
better off ? how could she ever find love and happiness , if you did what you 're talking about ? are you insane ?
well , i know , more so . that 's why i was thinking ... maybe she 'd be better off .
rose is n't oversexed , that 's ridiculous . if you 're going to talk nonsense , i do n't want to talk to you at all . rose is exactly the same as the rest of us , except more so .
well , i ... i had n't thought about it that much . i was thinking ... well , it 's an idea , the girl is oversexed , and ...
i ca n't believe you really meant it , if i did i 'd want to die . you are n't a male monster , that man is but you are n't . look me in the eye and tell me , do you really want to take rose 's womanhood away from her when it 's all she has got ?
well , now , darlin ' ... give me a chance to defend myself .
i thought i knew you . i thought i knew you better , i thought in your heart you were a good and kind man . well , i ca n't believe what i 've just heard in this room . a defenseless girl depending on you for protection , and you propose to mutilate and destroy her . how could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man ?
over ... my ... dead ... body !
reluctantly , i do . it would be a blessing to her and everyone else . the girl is oversexed and i say -- spay her !
honey , that 's no way to talk to the doctor , he 's merely doing his job , dear .
this conversation is making me a little sick .
i am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition . i wash my hands or the whole thing .
i 'd say about three months . are you satisfied ?
she does n't have to take her panties off , we can see her stomach with 'em on . all she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly .
honey !
i forgot that rose will lie like a child . she 's no more pregnant than i am , she just does n't want to go to that farm !
what did you forget ?
ah , ha ! hold the phone ! no forwarding address , huh ? in the shock of this brilliant move , i forgot something .
but she must know ... unless ... unless ... rose , was there more than one person ?
she already told you , she does n't know .
that 's why i 'm asking her who the father is . it 's the most vital question of all . who 's the father , dear ?
you 're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning . the problem is , what are we going to do ?
poor thing , do n't cry , rose . i know you feel awful , but do n't cry , honey , nobody 's perfect . who 's the father , dear ?
this is a total catastrastroke . as of this moment i am stumped , i admit , i am stumped and treed both , the hound dogs have me surrounded .
trickery and flummery or not , she 's going there tomorrow on the bus ! it 's settled ! and i must say we 've been more than fair to you , rose , it 's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that !
it sounds like a farm to me . calling it a dairy establishment , that 's just trickery and flummery .
i do n't give a hoot in hell 's hollow what it means to her ! she ca n't stay in this house forever ! i fired her , damn it !
i do n't know how you can call it ideal -- do n't you know what the word `` farm '' means to her ?
just a minute , rose , you do n't understand . this is n't a dirt farm like the one you were born on , it 's nice . a neighbor of cousin hop 's , i talked to him on the phone , a fine man ... it 's not a farm , damn it , it 's a beautiful dairy establishment ! stop crying , rose ! do you hear me ? stop crying , it 's ideal !
honey , rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life . now i do n't think --
something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever .
she 's just nervous and worried . and you would be , too , if you had no job and no place to go .
her plan is obvious , plain as day . she 's going on a hunger strike . the question is , how do we foil her ?
no , she does n't , she 's fine , fine . she 's perfectly healthy , do n't give her ideas .
she does look a little peaky .
the hell we ca n't .
she ca n't get a job , it 's a depression . and we ca n't just throw her out on the street .
it has been three weeks since i `` fired '' her . is there no way to get rid of this girl ? are we stuck with her for life ?
just a moment , dear . we ca n't have it , rose . can you behave yourself -- or not ? that is the question , to behave or not to behave , to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous chastity and keep your skirt down or to hoist it in the light of the moon and make whoopee -- that is the coil shuffling question . if you ca n't behave i am going to fire you and i say it in front of you and mrs. hillyer and i mean it . i point my rigid finger right at your nose , rose , and i stare unwaveringly into your big blue eyes and i tell you ... this is a final warning . do you hear me ?
she has n't actually done anything ...
um-hmm . come with me , brother . i want to show you something .
she 's like a different person . being so sick made a big impression on her . i really think she 's learned a lesson .
sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit . your real trouble is that you 're anti-intellectual . the irony is women are supposed to be emotional , but i never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do .
i do n't care where the polecat studied .
honey , dr. martinson is n't a rascal , he 's one of the finest physicians in glenville . he studied at johns hopkins university .
i do n't see how you can even think of it now .
rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed . i hope she 'll be all right , but i still think we ought to fire her .
he 's a polecat , dear .
you do n't like him because he 's a yankee . he 's a brilliant doctor .
i ca n't stand that polecat . they ought to hang him .
honey , please ...
excuse me , sir , are you calling my wife a liar ?
i 'll talk to her , i 'll reason with her .
darlin ' , rose has got to go !
what she does n't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people . she 's young , she 's got to learn to restrain the life force that 's in her . its creative , but in her case it 's too creative .
they follow her because she 's a -- -- no , i wo n't say that .
if you mean sex , you could n't be more wrong . rose likes those boys and men , she has love in her heart , and that is what they want . it 's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her .
well , i have a pretty good idea .
how could rose really be a bad influence on dolly ? she has a loving nature , you ought to want someone like that around your children . why do you think those boys and men like her ?
but what i said is the simple truth . and now i see something else , i see more deeply into it ...
now look , darlin ' , this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension .
but morals come from the heart , not from rigid rules and empty laws . and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would . therefore , she 's not immoral . not really .
that is exactly what i 'm afraid of . the girl has got to go , darlin ' .
who is to say our morals are better than hers ? but maybe you 're right . she could ... influence dolly ...
it 's because of the children she 's got to go . i do n't want to be holier-than-thou , but the girl does n't have the same outlook we do . morals do n't mean a thing to her , not a thing , and we ca n't have a girl like that in this house .
well , she does seem to cause a lot of trouble , i admit . but she does n't mean any harm and it 'll break the children 's hearts , they all love her .
i 'm sorry , darlin ' , i hate it as much as you do .
well , that 's very reasonable . howe i hate to bring it up , but she 's got an awful toothache , we 've got to carry her to the dentist .
i said i do n't intend to fire her . i just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth , that 's all .
it is n't her fault if she 's popular ... what ?
i do n't intend to fire her , darlin ' .
just a moment ! you are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends , not while there is breath in my body !
now you listen to me , rose --
i do n't intend to mock you , dear . i respect your philosophy . it 's beyond my comprehension , but i respect it .
and when i try to talk to you seriously , when i try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life , how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts , what do you do -- you mock me !
now darlin ' , what has the south got to do with this ?
yes ! yes , i say that to you , they were boys ! boy friends of rose , chat 's what they were , and why should n't she have boy friends ? do you want her to be unnatural ? do n't you think she 's human the same way you are yourself ? it 's the south , that 's what it is , the south with its horrible traditions , of slavery and crime and the oppression of women , who are just as good as men and just as human !
boys ? you say to me boys ?
scoundrels ? they were n't scoundrels , they were just boys .
-- i am not responsible for her epizootics and i did not bring about her epizootics . now listen to me . when i have to get up in the middle of the night and defend my home with a shotgun against a couple of damned scoundrels fistfighting in the bushes --
darlin ' , it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
you certainly are ! she has an awful toothache , look at her jaw , it 's all swollen .
i am not being brutal to her !
i will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl .
oh , shut up , rose . shut your mouth and quit crying !
rose , i realize you do n't know this boy , but if you know anybody who does know him , if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be , then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife ... and i do n't mean maybe .
well , it is n't rose 's fault boys and men like her . you cant blame her for that , hon .
rose , my patience is wearing thin . first a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away . this is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show .
that sulky boy was here again this afternoon . i was almost scared , he would n't go away .
yes , darlin ' , time will tell .
well , time will tell , wo n't it ?
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . all i 'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later .
well , i wish you 'd stop criticizing and picking on her .
no reason at all , darlin ' .
why should n't she go out and have boyfriends ?
i do n't see any bruises or broken bones .
is she all right ?
quarter of twelve .
what time is it ?
well , she 's back .
yes , of course .
be kind to her . she loves you so much . in a perfectly proper way , of course .
you are the one who 's good-hearted . as for rose , let 's hope for the best .
but that 's a wonderful quality , not a bad quality . have a little patience with her . she 's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard .
well , she loves children , all right . she loves everybody .
he and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children .
that farmer in gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her , and i 'm beginning to see why .
i do n't think you understand her . it is n't sex she wants , it 's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it .
she will succeed .
well , i admit that outfit is n't very modest . but she does n't mean any harm , she just wants to attract , attention .
the girl worries me . if she walks down the street like that , an army will be following her .
i wish you would n't pick on rose and tease her like that . of course her clothes are silly , but she 's ignorant , naive , she does n't know any better .
rose , you and brother wait in the car . i want to speak for a moment lo mr. hillyer .
just half-a-cup of coffee . i never eat , darlin ' , you know that . not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses . let 's go , rose , you and brother , let 's hit the road .
you 're not having lunch ?
who does n't have such thoughts ? we 'd better get going .
well , it is a little tight . but it is n't as bad as all that . no one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place .
they 'll put her in jail . the damn little fool might as well be naked .
i 'll take him with me downtown . and you , too , rose , if you want a ride .
i 'm serious . we forget he 's just a child . i wish you 'd speak to him .
lay off of that stuff , son . it upsets your mother .
why , they wo n't either . she looks pretty . and i wish you would n't pick on the poor girl all the time . do n't listen to him , rose , you look pretty , even beautiful .
um-hmm . well , that is the damndest outfit i ever saw in my life . you walk down the street like that and they 'll put you in jail , rose .
no , darlin ' . just that damnable insomnia in reverse . i sleep like a baby for an hour then i 'm wide awake . you go back to sleep .
what 's the matter , hon ? is anything wrong ?
all right , darlin ' .
i think about what i 'm doing all the time , and i 've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody . besides , i want you to stay and help rose with the dishes , the poor girl is n't feeling well .
i 'll drive you , darlin ' . you 've got no business behind the wheel of an automobile . you do n't think about what you 're doing and you 'll run into a telephone pole .
you 're a wonderful woman , darlin ' . as long as you 're around , i 'm sure the sun would n't dare go out .
be nice to rose . she 's never had a real home .
forgive my crudity , darlin ' . i do n't understand these deeper things the way you do .
i 'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension , when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control . as blake said , if god had doubt the sun would go out .
all right , darlin ' , do n't go off into the fourth dimension .
hotcha character . if i had to live with your cynicism , i would n't want to live at all . what you ca n't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive , not negative .
i love rosebud , i am wild about rosebud . i just hope she does n't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character , that 's all . we have growing children in the house .
hope for the best ? i do n't understand all this skepticism . i thought you liked rose .
well , let 's hope for the best , darlin ' .
well , she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in birmingham , even if she did run away from them .
there are no flies on rose , i do n't know what you 're talking about .
well , i 'll admit i do n't see any flies on her yet .
and she 's such a good-hearted thing , there is n't an ounce of harm or malice in her .
um-hmm . almost too perfect .
honey , she 's perfect . she works all the time and she 's wonderful with the children . and they love her , even brother likes her though he wo n't admit it . i think she 's just perfect .
i asked you what you think of rosebud , now that she 's been here a while .
oh . did you say something ?
your hearing aid , it 's buzzing at me like a snake .
what ?
turn up your hearing aid .
what do you think of her , honey ?
slow , hon . but at least i can concentrate now that rose is here .
how goes it , darlin ' ?
yes , it 's so nice i thought i 'd work outside .
good morning , sweetheart . beautiful day .
well , well , well . so miss rosebud has arrived . un-hmm . and you 're all assembled here . yes , indeed . un hmmm .
it is n't the fourth dimension . to you it 's the fourth dimension , maybe , to me it 's simply the truth .
nothing , rose .
what was it , mr. hillyer ?
rose ... i hate to be mean , but ... oh , nevermind , forget it .
well , i 'll pay you that back sometime , mr. hillyer .
well , we know you were there . the bill that hospital sent was absolutely horrendous .
perfect , wonderful , good as i ever felt ! except for a big old scar on my stummick , i would n't even know i been in the hospital .
you 're looking very chipper this morning , rose . sow do you feel ?
all right , damn it . we 've seen you with your clothes off around here , stand up and pull up your dress and let 's take a look !
it 's so , mr. hillyer .
i do n't believe it .
i have n't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big .
all right , tell us , rose , what makes you think you 're pregnant ?
yes , mr. hillyer , i am .
no , you 're not .
yes , i am .
good god almighty . this is a catastrophe , they wo n't hire her .
yes , mine . i 'm going to have one .
your baby ?
mine .
what baby ? what baby ? what baby are you speaking about ?
what ?
i 'm not cryin ' because of me , i 'm cryin ' because of somebody else .
no , no , not exactly . it is n't a farm in the sense that it 's a farm . not at all . it 's a ... dairy establishment . you 'll 1ike it ! i 'm sure you 'll like it because it 's so ... peaceful !
you mean a farm ?
ahh-hh , you 'll like it . it 's a fine , outdoor-type job .
well . what kinda job is it ?
yes , tennessee , a lovely state !
tennessee ?
well , i have got news ! i called long distance and spoke to cousin hop and you 'll be glad to know , rose , i have found you a job !
yes , sir .
god forbid . you 're not sick , rose , forget it . do n't get any notions in your head , you 're not sick .
mmm . would you get me another half a-cup of coffee , dear ?
what 's the use , there ai n't none .
well , rose , going out to look for a job today ?
rose , darlin ' , you break my heart . but i am only a human man myself of the father variety . rose , pack your bag , baby , as of this moment you are hired , mired and fired .
mr. hillyer , i know it was bad and i had n't ought to of done it . but i 'm only a human girl and i ... i ai n't always perfect . i promise i wo n't let him in the house no more , i promise . wo n't you and mrs. hillyer forgive me ?
under the mattress . i hid 'em so you would n't be mad . he wants to marry me , he loves me . i ca n't marry him , he 's too young and has n't got no job , but he loves me ... now you would n't hurt him , would you ?
ye gods and little fishes , a fireman . put on some clothes , rose , you 're naked as a jay bird . when you 're dressed , come on downstairs . i 'm afraid your friend billy is injured , where are his clothes ?
he 's a nice boy , you 'd like him . he wants to be a fireman .
well , it was a silly question .
well , mr. hillyer , billy 's very poor , he do n't have no money and there was n't no place else to go .
and what , may i ask , was billy doing here ?
well , it 's billy .
and who , rose , may i ask , is that ?
where is he ? where have you got him hid ? ah , ha !
there ai n't nobody here , mr. hillyer ! honest , there ai n't !
yes , sir .
i mean a human investment , rose , we care about you , you matter to us . but we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop . do you hear me ?
yes , air .
i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i did n't mean to bite him , i really did n't .
i have to go back to the hotel . i 'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive . i will see you at suppertime , rose .
i did n't mean to bite him . he was hitting horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and ... and i bit him accidental .
well , i do n't know what happened . they were arguin ' about baseball , then all of 'em started fightin ' . as for that policeman , i did n't bite him , i do n't think i bit him .
that 's all you 've got to say , you 've got a bad cold ?
i got an awful bad cold .
oh , no , sir .
umm . well . yes . but no more strange voices in the night , rose .
boy , for four or five days there i did n't think i 'd live . but i 'm my old self again !
well , i know it , i just got the bill for it .
wonderful . except i can touch the place back there with my tongue , i would n't even know i had that tooth pulled .
good morning , rose . and how do you feel today ?
yes , sir .
all right , thanks to her , and thanks to this case of epizootics , you are getting another chance . but do n't try my patience again . we have growing children in this house . do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
darlin ' , i 'll take a taxi to the hotel . you and brother can handle the girl 's epizootics . i 'll just say one more thing . rose , i told you you had a friend in mrs. hillyer , did n't i , that she would fight for you like a tiger ?
i 'm not hungry .
oh , shut up , rose , eat your cornflakes !
ohhh-hh , ohhh ...
now rose , stop behaving as if you 're bo peep . those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house , and it was n't dolly or mrs. hillyer .
yes , sir .
strange voices , rose ?
yes , mr. hillyer , it was . i ... i heard strange voices in the night .
well , rose , my sleep was a little disturbed last night , and so was mrs. hillyer 's , and so was the children 's . how about you ? was your sleep disturbed , too ?
it 'll do just fine . bye-bye , see you later .
is this ill right ?
oh , i 'll just mosey around here and there .
you do n't know where you 're going ?
oh , anywhere downtown .
where do you want me to let you out , rose ?
yes , sir . i had to go to the bathroom .
you were up late last night , too , rose .
my rose . it 's kind of like a motto . people will say , there comes rose with her rose .
what have you got in your hair , girl ?
there are more on the other side .
how can the buttons stand the pressure ?
well , it has buttons .
that 's a pretty stylish skirt , rose . the only thing i do n't understand is how did you ever get it on .
um-hmmuhh . i never drink a whole cup , my nerves ca n't stand the caffeine . ehh-hh , lord awful insomnia in reverse last night . lay there and sweated blood for hours .
why , sure , always got time to get you a half-a-cup , and one of these days i 'm gon na get you a whole cup and see what happens .
if you 've got time before you go `` out , '' get me a half-a-cup of coffee , rose . not a whole cup , a half-a-cup .
you 're so sweet .
yeah . i 'm goin ' out .
got yourself up ?
nothin ' . i got myself up , that 's all .
well , good night .
no , sir .
is anything wrong ?
nothin ' , just goin ' to the bathroom .
rose , what are you doing up ?
do you know what a friend you have got there ? do you know she would fight for you like a tiger , that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you ? is this any way to repay her trust and love ? are you ashamed as i am ashamed ? do n't cry , honey , do n't cry . but let me warn you , damn your hide , this is thermopylae and i am standing here . do you hear me , damn you . i am standing at thermopylae and the persians shall not pass ! now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes , and stop crying !
oh , i know . she 's so sweet , she 's been so good to me ...
rose , rose , rose , you poor miserable little child , do n't you know i love you ? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it ? you are beautiful to me , rose , i 've loved you since you first came here , darlin ' . and do n't you know mrs. hillyer loves you , too , that she 's already taken you into her heart , and that that woman 's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars ?
oh-h , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry , mr. hillyer ... i just ... could n't help myself . i 'm sorry ...
goddamn you , girl ! you 've made me make a fool out of myself , damn your hide , but let me tell you i am standing at the pass of thermopylae and i wo n't budge ! the very idea , my own home with children in the house , to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h , you had better believe i am standing at thermopylae , you little nut , you had better believe it ! what are you , crazy ? a man is supposed to be a fool like this , but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense ! are you a nitwit ? what 's the matter with you ?
calm down , rose , let 's calm down and discuss it ...
do n't make me ... me ... me ... get up !
all right , all right . now calm down , rose , the children will hear you . calm down , let 's talk ... about this thing , let 's discuss it .
no , no ! you do n't understand , i love you ! it 's real love and i ca n't help it ! please kiss me , mr. hillyer , i love you , i love you so much ...
why , i 'm not going to kiss you , you crazy girl . now i 'm telling you again , get off my lap . come on , rose , get up . now you get up , i say , and stop this !
yes , crazy about you ! kiss me , mr. hillyer !
ahh-hem ! now , rose , get off my lap . what are you doing , girl ? are you crazy ?
i ... i 'll get the grits .
rosebird baby , you are the light of my life , darlin ' . how did we ever get by without you ?
oh , i do n't know , i ... i ...
rosebaby blossom , these are the most delicious candied yams i ever ate ! why , they just melt in my mouth . and this fried chicken is fit for a king . how do you do it , peachbird ? what is the secret of your art , plum blossom , huh ?
yes , sir .
all right . now as head of this household i have a couple of remarks to make . it is my dear wife 's belief , which i accept although i do not totally grasp it , that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice . therefore , you are here not as a servant , you are here as a friend , as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family . you will eat your meals with us , you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony , dear rosebud , in love and harmony . do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
oh , to hell with it , never mind . do n't tell her anything . do n't even tell her you saw me . got to run , buddy , i 'll miss my plane .
what do you want me to tell her , dave ?
you might see her . she writes your daddy , and she and that doctor came to see him , did n't they ? i wish you 'd tell her something ... i never could write letters .
dave , i have n't seen rose for years .
ah-h , if you happen to run into rose sometime ... do me a favor , give her a message for me , will you ?
yeah , i 'll do that , dave .
well , got to get a plane to savannah . great running into you , buddy . give my best to your daddy .
yeah , i remember it .
she used to call me mr. right . remember that , buddy ?
yeah , it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right , but she did it . she found him .
you loved her , did n't you . well , so did i. you 'll have to admit she had four husbands .
dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time . to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life .
i do n't want to start no fight with you , buddy . why do you say i 'm full of shit ?
dave , you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it . now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail , go right ahead . but i am telling you , you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs .
she did n't marry him , though , later she married another guy and went to winston-salem . it did n't last that girl could n't have no lastin ' marriage , she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west . little bitch left him , too , and you know what she 's married to right now ? a kike . that 's right , some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle , who 's got the nerve to have the same first name i got . would n't you know it , rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike ? she was always out of her friggin ' head and i 'll tell you why . buddy , she was sick in her mind and between her legs , too . she was a nymphomaniac .
she 's te reason -- cured me of women once and for all . oh , i got rid of her , buddy , i did n't waste no time kickin ' that bitch out . hell , she was screwin ' everybody in savannah . i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin ' piss out of him !
well , no , i did n't actually .
doubted my ability all along , the little bitch . i never remarried , buddy , you know that , do n't you ?
um-m , well ...
that 's correct -- outside it , not in it . as for the job , well , the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ai n't worth a sorry-ass damn . but i can build anything , buddy . give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon . it 's a fact , i can build anything ... ... but she never believed that . oh , hell , no , she never believed in me .
i see . outside it .
near alexandria . it is n't in alexandria , it is outside it .
tell me about that job in alexandria , dave , the big motel you 're building .
she has other things to do , dave .
took your time gettin ' here .
hey , girl ! hey , you , give us another drink ! dumb little bitch , supposed to give us two in the first place .
that 's right , dave , i 'm headed for glenville on a whisperin ' jet .
heh heh heh heh , same old buddy , always jokin ' around . almost as much of a joker as your daddy . i saw your daddy a coupla years ago , i was up in glenville lookin ' at a motel site . i guess that 's where you 're headed , huh , to see him ?
well , actually , we have a little black boy named her -- -t who lives in the garage . he does it for me .
i do n't mean that the way it sounds . imagine it , a book . and i used to know you personal way back when . tell me something , buddy , how do you dream up all that stuff ?
oh , yeah ?
how about that . well , you always were a screwball .
page proof of a book i 'm working on .
galley what ?
galley proof .
ha ha , course you make a lot more . what 's that you got there , buddy ?
oh , it 's all right , beats jew york . but the niggers have took it over , just like every other city we got , only worse .
well , that 's interesting , dave . i always liked washington , it 's a pretty town .
well , i am in the construction business , buddy , and without braggin ' i have done real good at it . there are those who would n't have expected that out of me . right now i 'm buildin ' a giant motel unit near alexandria , outside washington , d.c. not fi-nance , i 'm on the construction side .
oh . oh , god . of course , dave , how are you ?
it 's dave wilkie ! i 'm dave wilkie , do n't you remember me ?
well , i ... i ... ah-h , let 's see ...
awww-rr , buddy , come on , you know me !
excuse me ... your voice is familiar and i 'm sure i know you from somewhere ...
i do n't know . i think he 's cryin ' !
what 's the matter with him ?
i 'm only trying to help him , mother .
you must n't be a tattletale , dear . you must n't be delilah-ish and jezebel-ish toward your brother , dear .
daddy , buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books . mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it , he took the lords name in vain , then claimed he had n't said it . he lied , daddy .
mother , buddy says rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says i would too if i was grown-up . is it true , mother -- would i sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says ?
yes , dear , what is it ?
daddy would n't hear that . now the redhaired boy you see sitting there , of course you have met him , he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child . all children have great creative powers , but i do n't want to rattle on about my children , they say i brag too much about them , especially about brother . am i boring you , rose ?
i do n't like that , either , it 's worse than waski . i want to be called fran .
let him be guided not by my wishes and not by rose 's wishes , although i am sure they are identical . let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself , because that is what has spoken through me tonight .
actually of course i wo n't operate , i do n't do major surgery . dr. hardy will operate and of course he 'll be guided by your wishes in this respect .
i understand you perfectly . you leave that girl alone , you wretched man , or you will be sorry .
yes , i understand you , but you have misunderstood me completely .
i will not cry like a woman . if i 'm upset it 's because of what my husband said , not because of you . you ca n't make me cry like a woman , a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man . and you get this in your head . if you hurt that girl , i 'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got , i 'll do my level best to ruin you . do you understand me ?
you 'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself , you 'd go that far ? do n't you think i know what you 've just said and do n't you think i understand the dreadful and revolting crime you 've just conspired to commit ?
illusions , madam ?
are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters ? is there no limit to which you wo n't go to keep your illusions about yourselves ?
mrs. hillyer , this girl is sick in more ways than one . she is an extreme psychoneurotic with uncontrollable sexual impulses . it would be a mercy to spare her the suffering she causes herself and others . therefore i recommend as a therapeutic measure the removal of her second ovary . it is ethically and medically the only proper decision in this case and i suspect your husband agrees with me .
what are you talking about ? i do n't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces .
i am thinking particularly of the other ovary . as a rule i do n't believe in removing it . the woman 's hormonal system is profoundly disturbed , she is subject to possibly serious depression , she loses many of her secondary sexual characteristics for example , her breasts might shrink and become flabby , facial hair might appear along with a coarsening of the features , and of course her sexual drive is greatly diminished , especially in a girl or young woman . for these reasons i am opposed to removing the other ovary , as a rule . do you follow me ?
yes , go on .
what do you mean , what kind of gobbledygook talk is that ?
i 'm sorry the truth nauseates you , mrs. hillyer , because before you leave there 's a bit more of it i 'd like to put to you . this operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that i feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl , who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well .
she 's an adult , mrs. hillyer , i was merely giving her the facts .
no , you should n't have , it was needlessly cruel . she thinks she has cancer and is going to die .
we make our own lives , madam . as for malignancy , i do n't think so , it 's very unlikely . i probably should n't have even mentioned that possibility to her .
well , that 's pathetic . poor rose , what a life she has had .
do n't worry , madam , she ca n't infect your dear little kiddies . she long ago fully recovered , but the disease did irreparable damage . the girl is permanently barren .
gonorrhea ?
i 'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant . an ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy . but it was pure wishful thinking on her part . the girl can never have children , she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated .
yes . well . she 's upstairs .
let me be the judge of that , madam .
oh , good evening , doctor . rose is a lot better , i just gave her her supper . she 's almost all well now .
i beg your pardon , epi-zoo-tics ? do you mean `` epi-zoo-ot-tics , '' an animal epidemic ?
yes , thank you , doctor .
it is kind of amazing . the dentist says she has perfect teeth , there is n't a cavity in her mouth .
it 's simply that i find it incredible , mr. hillyer . aside from the girl 's illness at the moment , she is very strong , a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one , too . she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child , if only sporadically .
exactly , and that 's why she could n't possibly have come from such a farm .
well , her people were very poor . she says she was often hungry as a child , and i 'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful , not a balanced diet at all .
a tenant farm ? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt ?
deathly afraid of it . her people were poor tenant farmers and she does n't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals .
afraid of the hospital ?
she hid it from us , doctor . she 's afraid of the hospital .
of course she does and i must say i 'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital . i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill .
she looks terrible , just awful .
well , mrs. hillyer , the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive . but not many people walk away from double pneumonia , madam , not many .
i think you 're right , it would be harder on her . but you 'd better call mr. hillyer , she 's going to need help to get home .
that would scare her to death . she 's terrified of hospitals . to her , a hospital is where you go to die .
yes , and it 's very bad . it probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia .
but the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled ?
well , she has one mouth in ten thousand , i do n't see teeth like that once in ten years . her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth , but there is n't a cavity in her head , not a single one . she has perfect teeth .
she was raised on a poor dirt farm . i 'm sure she 's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor .
well , she finally let me look in her mouth . is it true she 's never been to a dentist ?
no , waski , she wo n't die , because we are praying for her .
mother ... is rose going to die ?
there are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair . beauty is beauty and that 's all there is to it . beauty is there and we have to recognize it . now rose , the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is doll baby . she looks like an angel and she is an angel , but she can be a naughty angel sometimes , although her father wo n't believe it . her real name is frances , but we call her dolly or doll .
oh , mother , cut it out .
when he was baby we called him `` wa wa , '' a baby name , you know . you will find him a very good boy . his brother can be bad and so can his sister , but waski is a very good boy . and as you can see he 's beautiful .
you can stop it right now .
rose , this is waski . his real name is warren but we call him waski . he does n't like it much and i suppose someday we 'll have to stop calling him that .
and who do you suppose he is ? that policeman who arrested me , the one i bit ! he is mr. right !
well ... well , that 's wonderful , rose .
you 'll never guess what happened ! i have met mr. right ! i been with him all day and he loves me , i know he does , he loves me and he 's going to marry met be 's practi'cly ast me already !
forget about it , i do n't want you working in one of those honky tonks .
i was offered that job as a waitress .
do n't worry , honey , you 'll find something .
i do n't mind .
rose , you do n't have to .
oh , i know . but i did n't , really . honestly , i did n't . there was only one , but he 's out of town and leave no forwardin ' address .
rose , really , you should n't act like that .
oh-h , mrs. hillyer , i ... i ca n't think . i ... i 'm not really sure .
i know it 's embarrassing ... but who were you exposed to , dear ? rose well , now , mrs. hillyer , i ... ah-h , that 's kinda hard to say .
well , i ... i ... i do n't know ... maybe it was ... but no , you ca n't be sure about a thing like that . it was n't billy , i did n't know him .
i 'm not hungry . i ca n't eat nothin ' , i have n't been able to eat since i got fired . i think maybe i 'm sick .
rose , you do n't look well and you have n't eaten a bit of breakfast .
i do n't want to . when i was lyin ' there in that hospital bed at death 's door i says to myself , i ai n't goin ' out no more . if i ever get outta this , i 'll just stay home .
well , there 's no reason you should n't go out , rose ... in moderation .
well , you 're real sweet to make it for me . there never was nobody like you . and you do n't need to worry , i ai n't goin ' out no more .
you look very pretty in it , rose . really , you do .
yeah , it 's kinda nice .
you see , rose ? now that 's the kind of dress you ought to wear .
what ? wha-at ? mrs. hillyer ?
rose , you 're very sick . you 're burning up . rose , can you hear me ? rose ?
yes , ma'am .
rose has learned her lesson , have n't you , rose ?
it 'll get better now .
no more dentists , no more dentists ...
i know it was bad , honey . i 'm sorry ...
never again , never again ...
oh-hh , ohh-hh , lord , he 's gon na kill me .
rose , sit down in that chair and be quiet ! we 're trying to help you , you silly creature , sit in that chair !
i 'm not goin ' in there , i do n't like the looks of it !
no , rose , he 'll help you .
ohh-hh , a little . oh-h , i ai n't never been to no dentist before . he 's gon na kill me , i just know it .
poor thing . does the ice help , rose ?
be quiet , rose .
i do n't want to go to the dentist .
oh ... oh ... oh ! i think ... maybe ... one of 'em ... was foster ... but i do n't hardly know him !
i do n't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children .
i had better call daddy .
mrs. hillyer , i do n't know who he is , i really do n't .
rose , that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again .
doll , you and waski run on , too .
yes , ma'am .
oh , no , that 's the style . it 's meant to be clinging .
well , i think it 's charming , rose . but do n't you think ... ah , the skirt is a little tight ?
you look sick if you ask me . i hate to leave you with the dishes and all , but i 'm supposed to go to a meeting of the garden club this evening . i 'll need the car keys .
no , ma'am , i 'm just fine .
rose , you 're in an awful dither tonight . what 's the matter with you , honey , are you sick or something ?
yes , ma'am .
well , you run on now .
i like to work . i do n't mind work . it 's the least i can do after all you and mr. hillyer have done for me . you 're so sweet . there never was nobody like you .
really , why do n't you go sit down somewhere ?
you 're so sweet .
rose , you work too hard . why do n't you go sit down somewhere and drink a co-cola ?
it must be wonderful to be so smart . i do n't see how you do it , reading all those books , learning all that stuff .
well , i am working on my thesis .
are you going to get your degree soon ?
more history , rose .
what are you studying now , mrs. hillyer ?
well , it 's rather interesting about brother , actually . i realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old . he looked at me and understood me , he knew exactly who i was . i know it sounds crazy but it 's true . he 's very remarkable , he was born for the ministry and could move millions , but he does n't know that yet . i have to warn you about him , he can be very dangerous , there is an evil streak in him , a streak of pure sheer meanness . but at heart brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he does n't know it .
oh , no , ma'am .
... okay ... you made your point .
has n't he got enough problems , or did n't you notice that 's not cream soda on his breath ?
maybe i 'm not making myself clear . you 're probably the first girl billy-boy 's ever fallen in love with , and i know for sure you 're the first he 's slept with . so , how 's he gon na feel ... ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did n't have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up ?
what ... what makes you think you can order me around ? !
you 're not gon na see him again .
let me tell him . let him decide .
but ... i love him . i do ...
what were you gon na say ? exactly how did you think he was gon na make the leap from dating a sweet , innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star ?
i was going to tell him .
i 'm looking at this poster , and i 'm thinkin ' , i do n't remember seeing films like this when i was in school .
i ... i can explain ...
fair enough .
we 'll take the caltrust heist , but if it 's no good , we will hunt you down , and billy-boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it .
read my lips : zimmermann or nothing .
come on , do n't you screw with her , please ! you ... you got to want this : armored car job . caltrust bank . they took two million in cash ...
careful she does n't hit her head on the way .
alright , wait ... there 's a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine ...
who cares ?
hey , listen ... i 'll give you something else , kittle . anything . remember ... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach ? it was never identified ...
take her down to the car , and for christ 's sake be careful this time . last suspect he took in , butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs . what a mess . why is it we do n't appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?
cuff'em . let 's see what these two love birds say once they 're sitting in separate cages .
have i ever steered you wrong ?
am i supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin ' telescope ?
now you know what to watch for ...
a lincoln ? what lincoln ? lincoln continental ? lincoln mark five ... six ... ?
what and ? that 's what i got .
and ... ?
okay , man , okay . i 'm with you . i ... i heard how the shit 's arriving ... it 's coming in a lincoln .
you get nothing and like it . and if we 're not blissfully happy with what you tell us , we arrest you just for the fun of it .
well ... what can i do ? you 've created a dilemma ... and , look at the that . time 's running out . i wonder ... how can i impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me ?
i 'll tell you what ... i think it 's all you 've got .
you think it 's that good ?
i figure , for this information , the usual payment ... times ten .
how much ?
a little birdie whispered in my ear today ... about the needle-candy you 're chasing . it 's up here ... ... in the old curiosity shop .
put up your kickstand , freak . start talking , or we 're out the door .
what eve and i would n't give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain .
every person 's got their own kinks , beef-cake . what 's wrong , kittle ? you do n't swing ?
incestuous .
indivisible and inseparable .
abe lincoln ...
what ... ?
three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln . a parade float .
you do n't . it 's a gamble . but , not even in vegas are you gon na get close to this kind of cash . this is < u > two million < /u > , archie . it 's not three houses , it 's twelve . it 's dreams come true .
if i tell you , how do i know you wo n't just club me and take it back ?
it 's six o'clock . time 's runaing out . decide .
i do n't know . fuck off !
well , i 'm running out of trees , so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you do n't know ! convince me !
i 'm telling you , you 're barking up the wrong tree .
you 're zimmermann 's calculator , archie . all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal , you got to know something . maybe they told you , maybe you overheard things you were n't supposed to hear ...
just entering . we 'll get to the breaking in a minute .
this is private property . this is breaking and entering !
i do n't know , okay ? all i know is butch cassidy 's back in town .
i need the `` when '' and the `` where . ''
it 's bone dry out there . everybody 's hurting . the stuff floating around 's been cut so many times it 's like powdered sugar , but zimnermann 's gon na fix it .
alright ! alright ... put me down ...
last time billy-boy did this , the guy 's neck broke ... ... just like that . sad in a way . why is it we do n't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we 've lost the use of them ?
this scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the mexican border high as a kite for the next two years . you think we 're gon na let zimmermann haul it onto < u > our < /u > streets on the fourth-of-fucking-july ! ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about , man . even if i did , i 'm not so crazy i 'm gon na cross zimmermann .
know what he 's doing , benny ? he 's trying to jog your memory .
again .
hey now ... what the fuck ... ?
word is , while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool , 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city . and , right now it 's making a cross-country journey to hollywood , u.s.a .
oh , you fuckers ! you fucking fuckers ! what ? what do you want ?
really ? is that a fact ... ?
what do you want ? i 'm clean . i been clean a long time .
where you been hiding , grease-fist ? we 've been looking for you .
kittle ...
yeah . happy fourth of july .
happy independence day .
i 'm not taking a cigarette break , jackass , just give me one !
you do n't smoke .
gimmie a butt .
feeling great .
how you doing back there ?
we 're gon na rain on zimmermann 's parade .
where we going ?
same day as before . i think .
what day is it ?
they shot us all , kid .
they ... they shot me .
you 've never heard of napoleon brandy , mister smarty-pants ? how do you think it got its name ?
what about him ?
okay , seriously . what about napoleon , huh ?
who 's been giving you history lessons ? your bartender ?
entertainers do n't count .
dean martin .
name one .
i do n't know what the problem is . plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
i do n't know . i could quit now if i wanted , i just do n't want to .
the booze .
what ?
when you planning to cut back on that ?
beats me . you got a suggestion , feel free to shout it out , genius .
what 's the plan ?
welcome to beverly hills . wife-swapping capital of the world .
that 's sick .
clench your teeth so when we land you do n't accidentally bite off your tongue .
wh ... what ... ? !
clench your teeth .
look , kittle ... pull over and let me out . i 'll be fine ... okay ? how 'bout that ... ? oh , lord almighty , listen to me ... i do n't want to die ! ! lem me out of this coffin ! !
well , they sure know how to hold a grudge .
that 's them trying to kill us .
yeah .
the ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago ... ?
yeah .
remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time ... ?
could be worse . i do n't know how , but i 'm sure it could .
okay , we got ... one , two ... three ... two caddies and poe 's mustang .
lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes . it 's a tax dodge .
no offices are gon na be open today .
it 's personal . we 'll hook up at billy-boy 's pad in an hour . see ya then .
where you gon na be ?
who 's that ? zimmermann 's money-man ?
`` a.d . ''
i got him .
ah , jeez , billy ... careful !
stop blaming yourself .
we shoulda been there to back you up . we shoulda !
you big , fat sonofabitch , if it were n't for me , you 'd still be sitting in the file room where i found you . and you ... nena ... you 've still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of . you of all people ...
all i got is being a cop . what do i do if i 'm not that ?
what of it ? have n't we waited forever ... ? have n't we , honey ? have n't we waited long enough to get this scumbag ?
yeah , but if we do n't sit , they 'll take our badges .
you 're just saying nothing ! tonight is the night .
i 'm just saying ...
what are you , henry friggin ' kissinger all the sudden ?
well ... we should n't rush into this , right ? let 's talk about it .
i say , fuck 'em . let 's go .
i can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt .
jiminy christmas .
hands off the suit , monkey-boy . close your eyes if you 're scared .
we should slow down .
relax .
this is too fast . this is < u > way < /u > too fast !
move it !
i 'd rather you guys did n't do this again .
make a hole , billy-boy .
get ready .
no you ca n't .
i can work this .
we 'll share .
we catch 'em , i wan na be first to hurt 'em . promise me i get to go first .
sons of bitches !
what do you want me to do about it ?
i ... i ca n't find my seatbelt .
save it . just go .
that was n't my fault .
escort everyone 's favorite she-male over here nice and peaceful-like . let 's not have another incident like at the laundromat . i 'll never forget the look on that poor woman 's face .
whoa , thanks , man . these are cool . they 'll be collector 's items .
just a little , you know ... bicentennial memento . nothing special .
i 'll give you a fucking hoot if you do n't shut up back there .
give a hoot . do n't pollute .
thank you , concerned citizen .
you should n't litter .
what , am i supposed to read it while i drive ? keep a grip on it , alright ?
jeez ... it 's too early in the morning for this . leave off . here 's your paper .
she 's right . if you two are doing the horizontal polka , the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around , knocking over furniture and calling you `` daddy . ''
it 's the way you say it , like there 's something more too it .
what 'd i say ?
lay off once , would you ?
nothing , i guess . just an observation . she 's really something special . you 're a lucky fella .
filthy kids go to kindergarten too . what are you saying , anyhow ?
tell me something ... what 's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville ? i mean , this is not the place for fine dining , unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite .
she 's fine , as if you cared .
how 's your precious little school-marm today ?
we 've got the tape to prove it .
he tried to kill us .
bummer .
there probably is .
feels like there 's a bullet still in my chest .
go wherever you want . live how you want .
you could start over again with cash like that .
what can i say to that ... except , i love you too , you mean-spirited bitch .
billy , i love you i really do ... but i 've got to tell you , every day , in every way , you give new meaning to the word `` stupidity . ''
oh . well . i think it 's pretty common knowledge that in the battle of little big horn , custer was drunk off his ass .
nope .
general jim beam , then .
no .
what about jack daniels ? was n't he a decorated general in the civil war ?
i 'm waiting till the time 's right .
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it ?
you 're lying ...
do n't talk like that . there 's plenty of women around for jerks like you .
... where ... where 's a jerk like me ever gon na find another girl to love him ... huh ? ...
whoa , whoa ... it 's gon na be alright .
speak for yourself .
if we do n't catch a break soon , we 're gon na be left standing with our dicks in our hands .
bad news is , word 's spreading like wildfire that we do n't have badges , and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like butch cassidy either .
okay . it does n't smell as bad in here as i remember it smelling .
ca n't you say something nice once ?
you live like a pig .
well , i got something.. pop-sweet 's accounting ledger for the disco-strip . all the money transactions . look ... someone 's putting their initials beside the weekly totals . like they 're acknowledging a deposit .
who said it wa 's me , hub ? anyway ... he fell off a ladder . it was n't really my fault .
then , why 'd we tie him up ?
this is the police lock-up . we 're police . how can we steal from ourselves ?
no , we 're stealing .
we 're not stealing . we 're borrowing .
i ca n't believe we 're stealing .
hey ... hey ! cool down , jumbo !
let 's go ! fuck everything ! god damn sons of bitching mother humpers ... i 'm gon na rip'em all brand new assholes ... !
just keep an eye out till i get this rig up and running .
okay . but , what changed our mind ?
we have to find kittle .
where we going ?
how come everyone thinks hitting me 's the best way to get my attention ?
follow me .
what the ... ? ! what was that for ?
you 'll cry like a great big , blubbering baby .
laugh it up . you 'll cry later .
what was i supposed to do ?
smooth move , hot-shot .
it 's go time , billy-b .
that 's him alright .
forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
hey ...
no , but it should .
it does n't say that .
`` leo . the stages of the moon are in alignment , so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement . wash yourself more carefully each morning , stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment , and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear . ''
what 's mine say ?
oh ... okay .
i 'm back here , are n't i ? so , you do n't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it .
you never heard of physics , einstein ? the laws of physics . the more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires ...
bullshit .
you know , the more weight back there , the faster the car goes .
what ... what kinda thing is that to say ?
birth control 's important .
wha ... ?
you been wearing rubbers , billy-boy ?
it 's not gon na happen .
well , i would like to sit in front today .
it 's just the way things are , kiddo .
why do i always have to sit in back ?
there was a time when you did things the right way , till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister .
you mean taking bribes , and skimming busts and letting hoods walk ? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe ?
what happened , kittle ? we used to be friends . you used to know how the game was played .
maybe .
you going rogue on me ?
our resignations .
i 'm here . that 's all that counts . watch ... you 'll enjoy this ... it 's like magic ...
where have you been ?
i 'm gon na put a great big , ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face . how 'bout that ?
not like this . are you even listening ?
there 'll be other chances .
hey now , look ! let 's all get on the same page here . this shipment is do or die for zimmermann 's syndicate ; all or nothing . if we stop the drugs , we do n't even have to catch him red-handed . he 's ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell . on the other hand , if we fuck this up , it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that does n't have a single empty drawer . more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks , and all the while zimmermann 's sitting back and laughing his head off .
yes , sir .
well , shake a leg . get these files downstairs ... and , quit listening to your fucking voodoo music .
he went to pick up lunch .
we 've been chasing this deal six months , and now you 're gon na chuck it out the window ?
ca n't i ?
you ca n't be serious .
it 's noon straight up . effective immediately , you three work desk jobs till midnight .
till the last firework fizzles out tonight , detective , you sit a desk . and , after that , i 'll decide if you keep your shield .
well ... seeing how you just suspended me , what 's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard , you old fart ?
you 're about an inch away from insubordination !
do n't you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day , and do n't tell me i 'm overreacting when i 'm trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city !
what ?
do n't bother . this behavior 's gone on too long . you 're suspended .
i ... i think i can ... clarify ...
no . do n't open your mouth ! you < u > honestly < /u > think you can explain this to my satisfaction ?
well , sir ...
and , what ... what am i forgetting ? oh , yes ... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house !
you think you accomplished something ... like you 're heroes ? fuck you ! this is meaningless ! you 'll never win ! you know , as soon as i 'm gone ... someone 's going to take my place .
it 's our job .
you fuckers ... damn you ! why ? ! why me ! ? why the obsession with me ?
wave that flag , hero . keep dreaming those dreams .
your poison 's not gon na make it into the veins of any kids this time .
i insist . what will it be ? boston tea party clam chowder , or maybe the chicken red , white and cordon bleu ? no ... there 's a special on the menu , today only ... ... < u > roasted < /u > < u > pig < /u > .
thanks , but we do n't recognize `` brunch '' as an actual meal .
murderer ? really ?
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club , does n't make you any less a murderer .
you bust some small-time pimps , whores and dime-bag junkies , like the world 's a better place because you 're in it . and for what , kittle ... two hundred and fifty dollars a week ? tell me , how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent ?
could n't have said it better myself .
thank you for sharing that charming image .
just wanted to make you aware ... before today 's over , we 'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you .
what can we do for you , officers ? what new , mindless harassments have you planned this morning ?
good . thought i was imagining them .
yeah .
you see that ?
keep 'em busy .
the gang 's all here !
well , that 's what i heard , and that 's what i choose to believe .
i do n't think so .
when you bunch it together , it 's exponentially more powerful . two sticks have the power of four sticks . four sticks have the power of sixteen , and so on .
do tell .
know what i love about dynamite ?
oh , yeah ... the explosion .
so there 's nobody around to get killed in the explosion .
why the beach ?
billy ! billy !
you john-wilkes-booth-ed him .
who the fuck knows ? we 'll find out soon enough .
think zimmermann 's watching ?
beholden to none .
no more counting the big money for someone else .
there 's not even enough places to stash it in a car .
this much powder you do n't throw in the trunk with a blanket over it . it 's got to be smuggled .
i 'm well aware of that .
we 're screwed .
it 's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans .
see ... now that we know you know , the hard part 's done for us .
you suck at lying , archie .
seatbelts fastened , please .
you 're ... you 're not doing what i think you 're doing ... ?
you mean , besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer ?
what the hell 's his problem ?
who is that ... ?
hey-ho ... ! maybe we 're not alone in this thing after all .
your wish is my command .
get his attention .
maybe it 's enough .
archibald dobbs ; certified public accountant . but , that 's all we got .
come again ... ?
a.d. is a c.p.a .
how 'd we do ?
just got here .
been waiting long ?
sounds good .
alright ... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together ? find out who `` a.d. '' is . i got a quick errand to run .
gimmie a minute .
if it is , that 's pretty high up on the totem pole . what do you think ?
chalk up another victory for billy-boy 's one man war on crime .
dead .
you get him ?
out here . on your knees .
alright , flesh-peddler , let 's see empty hands !
all for one ...
let 's get this thing done .
whatever goes bang .
any preferences ?
nothing 's broke . keep sewing . and quit pacing , you big ox . you 're making me skittish .
you need a doctor .
guys ... all we 've got is each other . do n't we know that by now ?
yeah , my arms healed up real good , and that 's how i wan na keep 'em . that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .
i know it is , even if you do n't .
that 's not true .
i worked my ass off for my badge , kittle , it 's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there .
i ca n't believe i 'm hearing this ,
he 's right . we hit the bricks , we walk back triple-fucked .
what ... ? not you too ?
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice ?
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate ... make him spin out ...
i kinda already figured that , but keep those helpful hints coming .
get closer ! do n't lose him !
okay , okay ... hold on . do n't go getting your panties in a knot ...
that 's right , white bread . give it up . right now .
oh yeah ?
ca n't be worse than you .
you think this is so easy ?
you ... suck ! you almost got us all killed !
no , we are < u > not < /u > going to do that .
i 'm gon na get beside . nena , you 're gon na shoot out his tires .
no you 're not .
i 'm gon na get beside him .
let 's hope .
if they crash , maybe he 'll run . you can shoot him in the leg or something .
shit . you 're right .
hold your horses , sweetpea . we need butch cassidy alive , remember ?
do n't crowd him .
`` go , go , go ! '' `` slow down . '' make up your mind .
slow down .
we got him .
absolutely .
alright ?
all i 'm saying is , your little bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper could n't get out .
yeah , well ... nobody 's perfect . they could n't go doing everything at once .
second of all , the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality , but it did n't do anything about slavery , did it ?
you know what i mean .
first of all , the constitution was n't writtem till 1787 ...
i just think you should show some respect . i mean , call me old fashioned , but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence , they did that so we could all share in the freedom ...
what are you , communist ? at least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them .
you 're the one with the star-spangled hard-on , not me .
you know ... you could say thank you .
yeah ... great .
let me see that ... not bad .
`` today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field . by your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character , you will come up a winner . ''
look out ! jupiter and saturn 'll get you every fucking time .
yeah , non-believer ? here 's yours ... `` scorpio , october 24 to november 22 : jupiter is in conflict with saturn , so proceed with caution ... ''
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap ? some fruitcake 's writing it between bong hits , making it up as he goes , and you 're actually taking the time to read it .
going into zimmermann 's pipeline .
arriving tonight
you are such a disappointment , benny .
pure horse .
whoops ... do n't mind me . go ahead and finish up .
pardon me ... my mistake . taking your thoughts in hand , huh ... ?
well , let me tell you how it is ...
the way zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling `` escort service '' of yours , i figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight .
yeah ? so , what do you want to ask today that i ca n't answer ? i 'm a busy man .
they 're ... around .
where 's your pet gorilla and the female uncle tom ?
that 's the problem with expensive tastes ... the more you got , the more you got to lose .
this shit was ming .
so are you , pop-sweet . that 's why ...
it 's one of a kind .
you always did have style .
we 're on our way . red group , gold group , all fighters follow me . told you they 'd do it !
the shield is down ! commence attack on thedeath star 's main reactor .
we 'll last longer then we will against that death star ... and we might just take a few of them with us .
at that close range , we wo n't last long against those star destroyers .
han will have that shield down . we 've got to give him more time .
we have no choice , general calrissian . our cruisers ca n't repel firepower of that magnitude .
you wo n't get another chance at this , admiral .
we saw it . all craft prepare to retreat .
all right . stand by .
all craft , prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark .
proceed with the countdown . all groups assume attack coordinates .
admiral , we 're in position . all fighters accounted for .
she has n't been trained in the ways of the jedi the way you have , luke ... but the force is strong with her , as it is with all of your family . there is no avoiding the battle . you must face and destroy vader !
but you ca n't let her get involved now , ben . vader will destroy her .
your insight serves you well . bury your feelings deep down , luke . they do you credit . but they could be made to serve the emperor .
leia ! leia 's my sister .
hmm . to protect you both from the emperor , you were hidden from your father when you were born . the emperor knew , as i did , if anakin were to have any offspring , they would be a threat to him . that is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous .
but i have no sister .
the other he spoke of is your twin sister .
yoda spoke of another .
then the emperor has already won . you were our only hope .
i ca n't kill my own father .
to be a jedi , luke , you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father could n't get past . impatience is the easiest door - for you , like your father . only , your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door , and you have held firm . you 're no longer so reckless now , luke . you are strong and patient . and now , you must face darth vader again !
but i had to help my friends .
vader humbled you when first you met him , luke ... but that experience was part of your training . it taught you , among other things , the value of patience . had you not been so impatient to defeat vader then , you could have finished your training here with yoda . you would have been prepared .
i tried to stop him once . i could n't do it .
you can not escape your destiny .
i ca n't do it , ben .
i also thought he could be turned back to the good side . it could n't be done . he is more machine now than man . twisted and evil .
there 's still good in him .
you father was seduced by the dark side of the force . he ceased to be anakin skywalker and became darth vader . when that happened , the good man who was your father was destroyed . so what i have told you was true ... from a certain point of view .
you told me vader betrayed and murdered my father .
yoda will always be with you .
i ca n't do it , artoo . i ca n't go on alone .
who are you ?
jabba 's palace .
where am i ?
your eyesight will return in time .
i ca n't see .
shhh . you have hibernation sickness .
his lightsaber .
oh , no , my young jedi . you will find that it is you who are mistaken ... about a great many things .
then you must go to the sanctuary moon and wait for them .
they are clear , my master .
strange , that i have not . i wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear , lord vader .
i have felt him , my master .
a small rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on endor .
i told you to remain on the command ship .
yes , my master .
it is of no concern . soon the rebellion will be crushed and young skywalker will be one of us ! your work here is finished , my friend . go out to the command ship and await my orders .
what of the reports of the rebel fleet massing near sullust ?
send the fleet to the far side of endor . there it will stay until called for .
what is thy bidding , my master ?
everything is proceeding as i have foreseen .
as you wish .
patience , my friend . in time he will seek you out . and when he does , you must bring him before me . he has grown strong . only together can we turn him to the dark side of the force .
yes , my master .
you have done well , lord vader . and now i sense you wish to continue your search for young skywalker .
the death star will be completed on schedule .
threepio , tell them if they do n't do as you wish , you 'll become angry and use your magic .
somehow , i got the feeling that did n't help us very much .
han , do n't . it 'll be all right .
hey !
yeah , sure .
will you take it easy ? let 's just figure out a way to get out of this thing . han , can you reach my lightsaber ?
nice work . great , chewie ! great ! always thinking with your stomach .
come on , artoo . we 'll need your scanners .
take the squad ahead . we 'll meet at the shield generator at 0300 .
we got separated .
i thought she was with you .
quietly , there might be more of them out there .
chewie and i will take care of this . you stay here .
it 's your imagination , kid . come on . let 's keep a little optimism here .
i 'm endangering the mission . i should n't have come .
i do n't know . fly casual .
now do n't get jittery , luke . there are a lot of command ships . keep your distance though , chewie , but do n't look like you 're trying to keep your distance .
vader 's on that ship .
all set .
right . chewie , let 's see what this piece of junk can do . ready , everybody ?
yeah , she 's comin ' up .
you got her warmed ?
hi , han ... chewie .
luke .
i have a promise i have to keep first ... to an old friend .
why do n't you leave that crate and come with us ?
oh ... great !
just stick close to chewie and lando . i 've taken care of everything .
you 're gon na die here , you know . convenient .
there 's nothing to see . i used to live here , you know .
i think my eyes are getting better . instead of a big dark blur , i see a big light blur .
that bad , huh ? where 's leia ?
the same as always .
how are we doing ?
would n't miss it .
fine . together again , huh ?
are you all right ?
luke !
han !
all right . i understand . fine . when he comes back , i wo n't get in the way .
yes .
you love him , do n't you ?
he was n't . i can feel it .
i 'm sure luke was n't on that thing when it blew .
here 's the terminal .
the code 's changed . we need artoo !
charges ! come on , come on !
han ! hurry ! the fleet will be here any moment .
hey , do n't worry . chewie and me got into a lot of places more heavily guarded than this .
the main entrance to the control bunker 's on the far side of that landing platform . this is n't gon na be easy .
hold me .
i 'm sorry .
ahhh ...
i ...
i do n't know .
what 's going on ?
it 'll take time . this whole party 'll be for nothing if they see us .
shall we try and go around ?
it 'll work . it 'll work .
now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid .
yeah , i just got a funny feeling . like i 'm not gon na see her again .
hey , are you awake ?
that 's all any of us can see .
i do n't know . all i can see is a lot of blowing sand !
i got ta get you out of here .
leia !
someone who loves you .
you , too .
good luck .
all right , old buddy . you know , i know what she means to you . i 'll take good care of her . she-she wo n't get a scratch . all right ?
look . i want you to take her . i mean it . take her . you need all the help you can get . she 's the fastest ship in the fleet .
oh , well , someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of taanab .
well , look at you , a general , huh ?
figured if i left you frozen like that you 'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life , so i might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later .
guess i owe you some thanks , too , lando .
all right ! a little higher ! just a little higher !
it 's all right . trust me . do n't move .
no , wait ! i thought you were blind !
chewie ! chewie , give me the gun . do n't move , lando .
i 'm trying !
lower it !
lando , grab it !
lando !
han ! chewie ?
let 's see .
oh , princess leia , are you all right ?
well , i suppose i could hotwire this thing .
my goodness ! artoo , why did you have to be so brave ?
oh , artoo , hurry !
come on ! come on !
we 're coming !
i 'm rather embarrassed , general solo , but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor .
what did he say ?
it 's against my programming to impersonate a deity .
proper ? !
i beg your pardon , general solo , but that just would n't be proper .
well , why do n't you use your divine influence and get us out of this ?
hello , i think ... i could be mistaken . they 're using a very primitive dialect . but i do believe they think i am some sort of god .
what are you telling them ?
all right , hang on .
here we go again .
on second thought , let 's pass on that , huh ?
in his belly , you will find a new definition of pain and suffering , as you are slowly digested over a thousand years .
you will therefore be taken to the dune sea and cast into the pit of carkoon , the nesting place of the all-powerful sarlacc .
good , i hate long waits .
oh , dear . his high exaltedness , the great jabba the hutt , has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately .
i hope so , commander , for your sake . the emperor is not as forgiving as i am .
we shall double our efforts .
that is correct , commander . and he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress .
then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives .
but he asks the impossible . i need more men .
the emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation .
i tell you , this station will be operational as planned .
perhaps i can find new ways to motivate them .
i assure you , lord vader , my men are working as fast as they can .
you may dispense with the pleasantries , commander . i 'm here to put you back on schedule .
lord vader , this is an unexpected pleasure . we 're honored by your presence .
copy , gold leader . i 'm already on my way out .
all right , wedge . go for the power regulator on the north tower .
there it is !
form up . and stay alert . we could run out of space real fast .
now lock onto the strongest power source . it should be the power generator .
here goes nothing .
i 'm going in .
now ... come on , han , old buddy . do n't let me down .
good shot , red two .
red leader standing by .
all wings report in .
oh , no .
i 'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash .
quiet .
oh ! oh , my . uh , princess leia !
he says there 's a secret entrance on the other side of the ridge .
what 's he saying ?
your royal highness .
oh !
ohhh , i ca n't bear to watch .
ugh !
because ... there is good in him . i 've felt it . he wo n't turn me over to the emperor . i can save him . i can turn him back to the good side . i have to try .
but , why must you confront him ?
no , you do n't . you 've always been strong .
no ! luke , run away , far away . if he can feel your presence , then leave this place . i wish i could go with you .
then you know why i have to face him .
i know . somehow ... i 've always known .
yes . it 's you leia .
you 're wrong , leia . you have that power too . in time you 'll learn to use it as i have . the force is strong in my family . my father has it ... i have it ... and ... my sister has it .
luke , do n't talk that way . you have a power i -- i do n't understand and could never have .
there 's more . it wo n't be easy for you to hear it , but you must . if i do n't make it back , you 're the only hope for the alliance .
your father ?
he 's my father .
vader is here ... now , on this moon .
luke , tell me . what 's troubling you ?
i have no memory of my mother . i never knew her .
she was very beautiful . kind , but ... sad . why are you asking me all this ?
tell me .
just ... images , really . feelings .
what do you remember ?
just a little bit . she died when i was very young .
leia ... do you remember your mother ? your real mother ?
i see them . wait , leia !
over there ! two more of them !
never-r-r !
sister ! so ... you have a twin sister . your feelings have now betrayed her , too . obi-wan was wise to hide her from me . now his failure is complete . if you will not turn to the dark side , then perhaps she will .
give yourself to the dark side . it is the only way you can save your friends . yes , your thoughts betray you . your feelings for them are strong . especially for ...
i will not fight you .
you can not hide forever , luke .
you underestimate the power of the dark side . if you will not fight , then you will meet your destiny .
you could n't bring yourself to kill me before , and i do n't believe you 'll destroy me now .
there is no conflict .
your thoughts betray you , father . i feel the good in you ... the conflict .
i will not fight you , father .
obi-wan has taught you well .
it is too late for me , son . the emperor will show you the true nature of the force . he is your master now .
search your feelings , father . you ca n't do this . i feel the conflict within you . let go of your hate .
if that is your destiny .
i will not turn ... and you 'll be forced to kill me .
you do n't know the power of the dark side . i must obey my master .
obi-wan once thought as you do .
come with me .
so , you have accepted the truth .
i know , father .
the emperor has been expecting you .
remember , a jedi 's strength flows from the force . but beware . anger , fear , aggression . the dark side are they . once you start down the dark path , forever will it dominate your destiny .
well , i 'm sorry .
unfortunate that i know the truth ?
unexpected this is , and unfortunate ...
yes .
told you , did he ?
your father he is .
yoda , i must know .
no more training do you require . already know you that which you need .
but i need your help . i 've come back to complete the training .
strong am i with the force ... but not that strong ! twilight is upon me and soon night must fall . that is the way of things ... the way of the force .
master yoda , you ca n't die .
disintegrated ?
splendid ! we have been without an interpreter since our master got angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him .
i am fluent in over six million forms of communication , and can readily ...
how many languages do you speak ?
oh . well , yes .
yes or no will do .
i am see-threepio , human-cy ...
ah , good . new acquisitions . you are a protocol droid , are you not ?
you are - so quake with fear , you tiny fools .
it 's as if we were glued to the spot .
rocky !
janet !
hmmmm . he 'll be in the zen room .
he might be . i do n't know .
and now he works for your government , does n't he , brad ? he 's attached to the bureau of investigation of that which you call u.f.o 's . is n't he , brad ?
he was a science teacher at denton high .
i know what you told me , brad . but this dr everett scott . his name is not unknown to me .
i was telling the truth .
i told you , my car broke down .
i see . so this was n't simply a chance meeting . you came here with a purpose .
on my mother 's grave .
you promise you wo n't tell ?
oh come on , brad , admit it . it was enjoyable , was n't it ? there 's no crime in giving yourself over to pleasure .
like this . like how ? it 's your fault - you 're to blame . i thought it was the real thing .
shush . janet 's probably asleep by now . do you want her to see you like this ?
ahhh - no - stop - i mean janet . janet .
i know , but it was n't all bad was it ? i think you found it quite pleasurable . oh so soft . so sensual .
you tricked me . i would n't have - i 've never - never .
nothing . why do you think i should ?
why you - what have you done with janet ?
i 'm afraid so , brad . but was n't it nice ?
you !
oh well . how about you .
certainly not !
do you have any tattoos brad .
janet
made me give you the eye and then panic ,
janet .
i 've one thing to say and that 's dammit , janet . i love you .
janet .
so please do n't tell me to can it .
janet .
the future is ours so let 's plan it .
if only we had n't made this journey . if only the car had n't broken down . if only we were amongst friends or sane persons .
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to beat again . so give me a sign that a lover makes you look around the one you 've found is back again .
i wanted to be loved completely . my body throbbed excitedly . oh brad , brad my darling , how could i have done this to you ?
so baby do n't cry like there 's no tomorrow after the night there 's a brand new day . and there 'll be no pain and no more sorrow . so wash your face and phone my place it 'll be o.k .
i could see brad 's face before me and my mind screamed no ! but my lips were hungry - too hungry .
and that 's all the time that it takes for a heart to turn to stone the sweeter the wine the harder to make the break you hear something about someone you 'd thought you 'd known .
i 'm engaged to brad just the same as betty monroe was to ralph hapschatt . but frank 's kisses overwhelmed me with an ecstacy i 've never dreamt of before . hot , burning kisses .
i hope so my darling .
janet ! oh ! yes it 's alright . janet . everything 's going to be alright .
maybe we could try it this way .
oh do n't be so shy .
no , do n't do that .
oh , i hope so my darling . but let me switch on the light .
it 's alright janet . everything 's going to be alright .
oh brad - mmmm - oh yes , my darling - what if ...
it 's alright janet .
brad ...
weiss .
weiss .
i 'm brad majors and this is my fiancee , janet vice .
it 's alright janet , we 'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right .
oh brad .
we 'll just say where we are then go back to the car we do n't want to be any worry .
right !
i 'm here , there 's nothing to worry about .
brad - i 'm cold , i 'm wet , and plain scared .
they 're probably foreigners with ways different from our own . - they may do some more folk dancing .
this is n't the junior chamber of commerce brad .
let 's wait awhile janet . we do n't want to interfere with their celebrations .
then ask the butler - or someone .
we ca n't go anywhere until i get to a phone .
well i want to leave .
it 's just a..a party janet .
but it seems so unhealthy here .
for god 's sake keep a grip on yourself janet .
brad , please lets get out of here .
say ! do any of you guys know the madison ?
oh ... .say something .
oh , it 's probably some kind of hunting lodge for rich weirdos .
oh brad , i 'm frightened . what kind of place is this ?
yes .
yes , the rain has been very heavy .
just a moment , janet . they may have a telephone .
oh , brad . let 's go back . i 'm cold and i 'm frightened .
i 'm coming with you . besides , darling , the owner of the phone might be a beautiful woman and you may never come back .
there 's no point both of us getting wet .
i 'm coming with you .
did n't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles ? maybe they have a telephone i might use .
but where will you go ? we 're in the middle of nowhere .
you 'd better sit here and keep warm while i go for help .
oh ...
we must have a blow-out .
what was that bang ?
hmmm ... well , i guess we will have to turn back .
oh dear ! but then where did the motorcyclists come from ?
i think we took the wrong fork a few miles back .
yes , janet . life 's pretty cheap to that type .
gosh . that 's the third motorcyclist that 's passed us . they certainly take their lives in their hands . what with the weather and all .
dammit , janet .
oh brad , i 'm mad .
for you .
oh janet
oh brad .
i really loved the skilful way you beat the other girls to the bride 's bouquet .
uh huh .
i 've got something to say .
yes brad .
yes .
and ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so .
yes .
everyone knows betty 's a wonderful little cook .
yes .
yes .
good god .
i most certainly do . he happens to be an old friend of mine .
you know this earth - this person .
great scott - scotty - dr everett scott .
you 're wet .
uh - oh - hi ! my name is brad majors . and this is my fiancee , janet weiss . i - ah - wondered if you could help us . our car has broken down about two miles up the road . do you have a phone we might use ?
hello .
you must leave now dr scott while it 's still possible . we are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of transylvania . go now .
yes , well perhaps it was for the best .
dr scott i 'm sorry about your nephew .
you 're ok by me .
a decision had to be made .
you did right .
yes , dr scott . a laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter .
great heavens , that 's a laser .
makes you cry
what guy
makes you cry
what a guy
cross my heart and hope to die .
promise you wo n't tell brad .
well , i 'm sure you 're not spent yet .
like this - like how ? it 's your fault . you 're to blame . i was saving myself .
ssssh . brad 's probably asleep by now . do you want him to see you like this ?
i know . but it was n't all bad was it ? in fact , i think you found it quite pleasurable . mmmmm so soft , so sensual .
you tricked me - i would n't have - i 've never - never
nothing . why , do you think i should ?
you beast , you monster , what have you done with brad ?
i did n't make him for you
well . i do n't like men with ... er , with too many , muscles .
cards for sorrow , cards for pain .
dealing
free to try and find a game
wheeling
like i 'm outside in the rain
feeling
smile and that will mean i may
oh my , my ,

now i
was all i had to say
goodbye
on the day i went away .
so come up to the lab .

and left from my dreaming was a feeling of un-nameable dread .
the delivery boy .
who 's eddie ?
oh .
the master is not yet married . nor do i think he ever will be . we are simply his servants .
oh , lucky him .
no . you 've arrived on a rather special night . it 's one of the master 's affairs .
are you - giving a party ?
you 're too kind .
i think you had better both come inside .
and our world will do the time warp again .
but it 's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane .
ah - sweet transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains . to take that step to the right ...
our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister , soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our `` androgenous '' planet .
they did n't like me . they never liked me .
i thought you liked them . they liked you .
creature of the night .
creature of the night .
c'mon , it 's true -- but that do n't bother me -- i just wan na prove somethin ' -- i ai n't no bum ... it do n't matter if i lose ... do n't matter if he opens my head ... the only thing i wan na do is go the distance -- that 's all . nobody 's ever gone fifteen rounds with creed . if i go them fifteen rounds , an ' that bell rings an ' i 'm still standin ' , i 'm gon na know then i were n't just another bum from the neighborhood ...
do n't say that .
it ai n't so bad , 'cause i was a nothin ' before --
oh , rocky -- you worked so hard .
... i dunno .
what 're we going to do ?
i been watchin ' the movies -- studyin ' -- he ai n't weak nowhere .
yeah , i ca n't beat him .
apollo ?
... i ca n't beat him .
... what ?
... ca n't do it .
i got ta go out for a while .
is everything all right ?
i do n't want ya cleanin ' nobody else 's cages no more .
what did you say about a pet shop ?
... what ?
what was that you said about a pet shop ?
yeah ...
rocky , do you realize everybody in this country knows your face , and after the fight everybody in the world is going to .
... yes --
wan na hear a dirty joke ?
... what 's to say ? i dunno what he wants from me --
... are you going to say anything to him ?
yo -- i ai n't mad . i 'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an ' paulie knows it .
do n't be mad at him -- he just wants to help .
yeah ... threw my whole day off .
... and he called the reporters --
ya right -- mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty , y'know .
i thought it might be cute .
yeah ... but i think weak legs ai n't bad sometimes , y'know .
-- the legs .
ca n't fool around -- you look very great .
do n't want weak legs .
adrian , you really look great , y'know -- but i ca n't fool around durin ' trainin ' -- makes the legs weak .
no ... sharp -- you look great .
really -- you do n't think they 're overly feminine ?
sharp -- real nice .
like ?
they either say , 'kill the nigger ' or 'hope you die , honky . ' -- what ya got in the bag ?
do n't you open them anymore ?
it did .
yes .
y'know how i said that stuff on television did n't bother me ?
i 'll be waiting .
'bout seven .
absolutely -- what time should i expect you ?
ya puttin ' me on , right ?
i do n't know -- i was shocked . why did you do that ?
how 'd ya like hearin ' ya name on tv ?
do n't tease me .
i always knew you was pretty .
could ya take off that hat .
... what ?
do me another favor ?
... t-thank you .
the glasses ... please .
what ?
would ya take off your glasses ?
but i 'm willin ' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation .
i should leave .
yo , i 'm not comfortable either .
i 'm not sure i know you well enough -- i do n't think i 'm comfortable .
they 're all the same .
... i 've never been in a man 's apartment before .
it 's all right -- you 're my guest .
no , i do n't belong here .
it 's okay .
i do n't think i belong here .
what 's the problem ? you do n't like me -- do n't like the turtles -- what is it ?
it 's not that --
it 's only temporary .
it 's fine .
what 's the matter ? ya do n't like the room ?
i 'll call your brother .
i think he might be worried .
why ?
yes .
you sure ?
yes , i do .
d'you really wan na call ?
i wan na let my brother know where i am .
i had it pulled . people callin ' all the time . who needs it -- who 'd you wan na call ?
do you have a phone ?
... oh , yeah , i bought the whole kit -- yeah , ya sold me the turtles , the bowl , an ' the mountain -- i had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin ' off .
i sold them to you .
here 's the guys i was tellin ' ya about -- this is cuff an ' link .
... no thanks .
would ya like a glass of water ?
'cause you ca n't sing or dance ?
... guess .
why do you do it if it hurts so bad ?
after a rough fight , ya ' nothin ' but a large wound . sometimes i feel like callin ' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom ... ya ' eyes hurt , ya ' ears hurt , ya ' hair even hurts ... but the thing i 'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an ' never had a busted nose -- bent an ' twisted an ' bitten but never broke ... that 's rare .
morning after ?
... i 'm at least half a bum . yeah , fightin ' is a crazy racket . the roughest part is the mornin ' after .
i do n't think you 're a bum .
ya got ta be a little soft to wan na be a pug ... it 's a racket where ya ' almost guaranteed to end up a bum .
... it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter .
then why did i bother bringin ' it up ? 'cause i 'm dumb , that 's why ... y'know , i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- i 'm dumb an ' you 're shy .
it does n't bother me either .
some people think bein ' shy is a disease , but it do n't bother me .
... i suppose .
i would say you 're very shy by nature .
... i suppose .
some people are very shy by nature .
my mother told me just the opposite . she said , 'you were n't born with much of a body so you 'd better develop your brain . '
what 's funny ?
by accident ?
y'know how i got started in the fight racket ?
ohh !
i just dislocated my finger .
absolutely .
but you never had a chance to prove yourself .
and you never got the chance ?
ai n't skated since i was fifteen -- that 's when i started fightin ' -- got ta watch the ankles . yeah , fightin ' use to be tops with me , but no more . all i wanted to prove was i were n't no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro .
... are n't you skating ?
i think mebbe we 're early or somethin ' --
i think it 's closed .
looks quiet , y'know .
to you , to me it 's thursday .
it 's thanksgiving .
... goodnight , rocky .
hey , how 's my buddy doin ' ? -- nice dog -- well , i 'll see ya later .

you owe me an ' are supposed to treat me good !

too old , dull fighter . bobby judge is a good boy .
give my main man a raise ! !
you 's the novelty , champ !
i do -- maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty .
do n't matter -- that name . 'the italian stallion , ' it 's right on . who discovered america ? an italian , right ? so , man , what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
rocky balboa -- his record 's poor --
'the italian stallion ' -- he 's my man .
... this man .
exactly what are you looking for , apollo ?

apollo , i 'm sure there 's a way to salvage this .
shape , nothin ' -- they 're afraid . they know everybody in the world 's gon na see this fight an ' none of them got ta prayer of beating me so they 're makin ' excuses so they do n't have to be the chump that 's gon na be whipped in front of the whole civilized world ! !
shaw 's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth ?
then gim me buddy shaw -- he 's ranked fifth .
i contacted ernie roman 's manager , he 's fighting in france the same week .
you best find me another ranked contender an ' i mean in a flash , man !
i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green .
damn .
... stay in school an ' use your brains , dig -- be a lawyer , be a doctor , carry a leather briefcase an ' forget about sports ! ! sports can only make ya grunt an ' smell -- be a thinker not a stinker ! !
any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls ?

where 're you off to now ?
the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gon na be held in the only place it can be held -- philadelphia ! -- the nation 's cradle -- january first -- the first major event of our two hundredth year .
still to be held in philadelphia ?
that 's right -- it 's gon na be the greatest sportin ' event in this country 's history -- a gala occurrence !
you 're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight ?
he was big , an ' very nasty so i destroyed him in a hurry -- now i 'm gettin ' ready for mac lee green next month .

... how 'bout for the cokes ?
i must be goin ' deaf 'cause i thought ya said , 'ten cents . '
that 's ten bucks .
yeah -- my ol ' man who was never the sharpest told me -- i were n't born with much brain so i better use my body .
here -- three minutes .
this guy is beautiful -- get the cokes .
cost ya a buck .
how 'bout some cokes ?
six !
it ai n't your fault -- i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight . that 's me fightin ' big baby crenshaw -- big baby was the size of an airplane an ' i broke my hands on his head -- i lost , but it 's a nice picture , do n't ya think ?
seven minutes !
hey , i ai n't cryin ' ... i still fight . kinda do it like a hobby . see i 'm a natural southpaw an ' most pugs wo n't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin ' an ' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded ... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best , right ?
nine minutes !
... yeah , give 'er the blades .
ten minutes for ten dollars .
... ten minutes .
few minutes ?
look at her , ya can see she ai n't feelin ' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
this a con ?
listen , i got ta problem . this girl ai n't feelin ' well , y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise , y'know once in awhile an ' ice skatin ' is the best thing --
yo , pal , what 's with you -- the place ai n't operatin ' .
wait here , got ta smooth this guy out .
hey , the rink is empty 'cause we 're closed -- ya ai n't allowed in here so do me a favor an ' not stay here .
are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody .
hey , whatta ya doin ' here -- we 're closed ... yo , we 're closed !
not only has he refused to fall , but he has beaten the champion 's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest .
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen -- the ringside audience is spotted with blood . this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall --
no way -- but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky . creed on the offensive -- balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart ... that hurt .
there 's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power .
apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations . balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creed 's temple -- not much movement from balboa , duck a left , a right , another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- i mean explodes . the champ backs off .
round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell .
if you had asked anyone who knows boxing , they never would 've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion ... most fighters will tell you , receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying .
creed is down ! ! !
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money 's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination . i feel sorry for --
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- creed does n't look the best he 's ever been but is moving smoothly -- creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner -- oh , a solid hook by creed , a master of fist-men .
i agree .
it 's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington -- a great way to start 1976 off .
am i seeing right ? creed is approaching the ring in a boat . is he supposed to be george washington ? obviously so .
you could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring --
i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- vegas odds say , 'no . '
thank you , bob . the electricity is everywhere tonight . rocky balboa , a fifty-to-one underdog , is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples ' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine , 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier . ' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring ... his record is forty-four wins , twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts .
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year ... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world . i would like to welcome an old friend , and co-commentator for this evening 's event -- jimmy michaels .
not yellow , cautious . see , it 's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
yo ' yellow , old man .
do n't mouth me , old man , i 'll knock yo ' out too . c'mon , wop , spar me , let everybody see who 's got the heat around here .
why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin ' or breakin ' a hand ? -- take a shower , dipper .
yo ' know i iz the best man here ! yo ' said so yoself !
you can forget about sparring , kid .
i 'm happenin ' ! this pig is takin ' my shot -- i iz a contender . he 's nothin ' .

sure , rocky , bob 's good for it ...
he only had a hundred an ' thirty . -- i think he 's good for the rest next week , mr. gazzo .
not spar , i 'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship .
sure , an ' i 'm smart enough to know that no sparrin ' partner should take cheap shots at the champ . he 's just there to help condition the man .
did you hear what i said ?
... like i said , i 'd make a boss sparrin ' mate .
rocky , would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship ?
i would n't take no cheap shots . i 'd be a good sparrin ' partner .
what ?
absolutely -- sparrin ' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what ?
i 'm sure you are .
i know ya need sparrin ' partners -- i 'm very available .
excuse me .

what ?
that does n't matter -- you do n't really have to be a whore , just act like one an ' that 's it .
c'mon , rocky . i 'm twelve .
'cause that 's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty . they think ya cute for a while , but then ya getta reputation an ' watch out . nobody 's ever gon na take ya serious . ya get no respect ... i got ta use a bad word -- whore . you 'll end up maybe becomin ' a whore .

nobody likes garbage -- anyway , this girl with the dirty mouth was n't bad lookin ' , but the guys would n't take her out for any serious datin ' .

every mornin ' , every night i pass by -- i smile . i say jokes . nothin ' . she looks at me .
forget her . you could do better than my sister .
your sister 's givin ' me the shoulder .
what ?
yo , paulie .
yo , rocky -- look at this mirror . i 'd like to kill the friggin ' moron who broke this mirror .
yo , paulie .
derogatory ? yeah , he 's great .
do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion ?
i 'll tear his head off .
maybe --
do you feel you have a chance ?
apollo 's a great fighter .
we can cut that out later . apollo creed says he 'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away .
how 're you preparing for this bicentennial bout ?
... people talk to me more .
so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much ?
listen , i wan na say hi to my girlfriend -- yo , adrian !
and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars . any comment ?
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago .
is it true the most you 've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars ?
creed 's great , ai n't he ... i 'll do what i can .
how will you fight apollo creed ?
feel ? i dunno ... happy .
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it ?
so what 's your next move , valiant ?
well , i 'll be ...
no . but neither does roger . that 's diablo red . roger 's pants are sunrise orange .
my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie .
oh , a ladies man , huh ?
yeah ...
you serve martinis , doncha ?
we do n't serve formula . snookums .
yeah ? does he wear pants this color ?
my hunch is it was maroon . he always was after acme 's property .
somebody took it from him . that 's what this whole thing 's about .
so where is it then ?
and another thing , the paper said no will was found . but every toon knows acme had a will and , in it he promised to leave toontown to the toons .
c'mon , valiant , does n't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you ? i mean , no offense , but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place ?
my problem is i come here to drink in peace . so if you do n't mind ...
you do n't believe that . i mean . the guy 's an idiot , a moron , a complete fool ... but he 'd never kill anyone . i know the guy .
you mean the rabbit ? they got him cold .
yeah , i had to go slummin ' . see , a friend of mine 's bein ' framed .
i know who you are . kinda out of your neighborhood , are n't you ?
make it dry . baby does n't like to be wet . you 're valiant , right ? the name 's baby herman .
sounds like you ve never seen her , eddie .
big on the musical comedy , huh ?
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit .
shoulda guessed .
that 's marvin acme , the gag king .
yeah , you still got it , betty . who 's mr. jocularity ?
work 's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color . but i still got it , eddie ... 'boop boop be-doop ' .
wish i could say the same . what 're you doin ' here , betty ?
gee , it 's swell to see you , eddie . we miss you in toontown .
i 'm not worried about you . i 'm worried about the safe .
do n't worry about me . i can take it .
i 've already dropped it on you twenty-three times .
please , raoul . i can give you stars , i know i can . just drop the safe on my head one more time .
that 's right , a tweeting bird . but what does the script say ? 'rabbit gets conked . rabbit sees < u > stars < /u > ! ' not birds , stars !
a tweeting bird ?
what 's this , roger ?
familiar . be careful , eddie .
that 'll work out just fine . when this thing is over , i 'll take you to catalina . how does that sound ?
yeah ... they closed me down for a coupla weeks .
what 've i got to lose ? you okay , dolores ?
are you gon na call him , eddie ?
i 'll bet .
i was hopin ' you 'd be there . maroon 's called here about four times . he says he 's got ta talk to you tonight . he says he can help you .
oh , no ...
sounds like singin ' .
what 's that comin ' from the bar ?
got me . but unless the will shows up by friday midnight , it 's theirs .
what the hell would they want with a gag factory ?
nope . it 's that cloverleaf outfit again .
maroon , right ?
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate .
probably lookin ' for a good place to stick a knife .
the rabbit 's wife ? wan na tell me what she was doin ' with her arms around you ?
< u > that < /u > was the rabbit 's wife .
what was < u > that < /u > ?
yeah , do that . i 'm gon na go rattle maroon 's cage .
eddie , you still got it . hey , tomorrow maybe i 'll go down to probate court and see who 's sniffin ' around acme 's estate ?
then why 'd they bother to crack the safe ? you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it wo n't open .
maybe they just took it out of his pocket .
maybe baby herman was right . somebody wants acme 's property . cack the old man , pin it on roger , and destroy the will .
so what 's the scam , eddie ?
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this .
can you get him out of it , eddie ?
i oughta have my head examined . will you hold still ?
so you decided to help him after all ?
it 's all yours .
oh , yeah ? well , you 're not handcuffed to him . anybody in the back room ?
he 's a riot .
dolores , meet roger rabbit .
jesus , eddie , is this who i think it is ?
he 's a toon ... who cares ?
so you 're not even gon na bother to find out if the rabbit 's gettin ' framed ?
stick to stuffin ' the olives , willya , dolores ?
the papers said the safe door was opened , eddie .
thanks for the vote of confidence .
yeah , eddie , it 's not like you got an ad in the yellow pages .
i do n't wan na think . i wan na drink .
do you think the rabbit did it ?
bastards put him on notice .
no kiddin ' ? bought the red cars , huh ?
a new outfit bought the red car . some big company called cloverleaf industries .
what are you complaining about ? here 's your fifty bucks .
hey , eddie , looks like you really stepped in it this time .
r.k. maroon .
check the scrawl .
is this paper even good ?
you 'll have it in the morning . now be a sport and lem me have twenty bucks to put in my pocket .
this is fifty bucks . i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow .
would this be the same dame who 's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i 've got her money .
so , makin ' dame jokes , huh , eddie ? well , lem me remind ya pal , it was a < u > dame < /u > who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump . and it was a < u > dame < /u > who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would . and it 's a < u > dame < /u > who 's tired of waitin ' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job !
that 's right , me .
you ?
not really . only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea .
surprised ?
holy shit , he 's a toon !
not for long . we 're retiring the red cars . people will drive , mr. valiant , because they 'll have to . and when they drive , they 'll have to buy our cars , our tires , our gasoline .
that 's what this is all about ? tell me , who 's gon na use your lousy freeway ? we got the red cars , the best public transportation in the country .
a freeway , mr. valiant , is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l.a. to pasadena . pasadena to hollywood . hollywood to santa monica . someday everyone will be in cars driving happily , non-stop from one end of the l.a. basin to another .
what the hell 's a freeway ?
right here where we 're standing , will be the cornerstone of my idea ... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways .
they wo n't care . who 's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future ?
do n't you think anyone 's gon na notice that toontown 's gone ?
it was n't toontown they wanted . it was my idea of how to put the land to better use .
come on , doom . what would a company like that want with toontown ?
no one person is cloverleaf . we 're a vast company with diverse interests ... gasoline , tires , automobiles .
so you 're cloverleaf ?
no matter . i do n't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes . by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally .
i 've had enough of your insolence ! put him in my car . i think they 'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory .
the pot 's callin ' the kettle maniacal .
these roads can be very treacherous at night , especially in a maniacal toon vehicle .
yeah ? well , do n't expect the toons to give you a gold watch .
well , why not ? i 'm feeling magnanimous tonight . the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist . i 'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector .
yes , and for that you 're charged with aiding and abetting . but we 'll let santino handle that .
i do n't think it 's gon na matter . sorry , pal , i tried .
you 're a very stubborn man , mr. valiant . very pig-headed . boys , show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station ...
i ai n't tellin ' you nothin ' ! get me santino .
indeed we are . we 'll continue the interrogation there .
you 're not takin ' me to downtown < u > toon < /u > town ?
oh , not < u > that < /u > downtown . < u > toon < /u > town .
downtown ? fine . get a hold of santino , i 'd be more than glad to talk to him .
take it easy , bongo . we 'll handle mr. valiant our own way ... downtown .
the other people who were in here lookin ' for the will . i woulda caught 'em if cheetah here had n't interrupted me .
they ?
they must 've taken it off me .
he had a will , all right . she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off . then she set up her loving husband to take the fall .
marvin acme had no will . i should know , the probate is in my court .
ask her ...
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective . what were you looking for , mr. valiant ?
have you tried walla walla ? kokomo 's very nice this time of year .
so you would n't have any idea where he might be ?
why would he contact me ? i just took some lousy pictures .
yes , i find that weasles have a special gift for the work . the rabbit did n't contact you by any chance , did he ?
men ? they look more like weasles to me .
hey , pal , do i look like a stenographer ?
yes , we talked to mr. maroon . he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures , and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back . is that true ?
he 's not my client . i was workin ' for r.k. maroon .
uh , eddie , do me a favor . could you sit in the back so you wo n't cause as much of a commotion .
not much . it 's hard to talk .
does it hurt ?
no ...
you 're a pig ... a happy-go-lucky pig .
what am i , earl ?
boy , i 'll say . they gave you a real toon-a-roo .
toon cops worked me over .
eddie ? jesus , what happened ?
earl ... it 's me , valiant .
here 's one for the books ... a toon wearin ' human clothes .
eddie , come on .
hold on a second .
he made me laugh .
lem me guess where you got that from . tell me somethin ' , what 'd you ever see in that guy anyway ?
looks like our goose is cooked , our hash is slung , our fait is accompli ...
a joker to the end .
when i opened up the blue envelope , all that was inside was a blank piece of paper .
so where is it ?
marvin told me . doom was after his land . ne was afraid . that 's why he brought me his will .
how did you get onto doom ?
he 's right here in the ...
where is he ?
we 're even . by the way , i did find your husband .
i did n't know who i could trust .
why did n't you tell me ?
it was doom who killed acme , you know ?
do n't worry , you 're not the first . we better get out of here .
lady , i guess i had you pegged wrong .
that 's not roger . it 's one of doom 's men . he killed r.k. maroon .
you shot roger .
if i 'm as bad as you think , what 's stopping me from just killing you right now ?
cause i do n't take acme dumb pills . i do n't know what you 're up to , lady , but i 'm gon na nail you for the acme murder .
it 's the truth . why wo n't you believe it ?
so altruistic .
i 'm not complainin ' . but give me credit . i 'm the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin ' pattycake , remember ?
i 'm not bad , i 'm just drawn that way .
yeah , well , you do n't know how hard it is bein ' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do .
oh , please do n't make fun of me , mr , valiant . you do n't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do .
oh , sure . i can just feature you standin ' outside your little hutch , holdin ' a carrot cake waitin ' for hubby to come home .
no , no , no ... i love my husband .
yeah , i 'll bet you would . you got ta have the rabbit to make the scam work .
you 've got the wrong idea about me . i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger . can you help me find him ? i 'll pay you anything .
no ? i guess we 're not counting lying , stealing and murder .
toons are n't given imperfections .
come on , lady , have n't you ever seen a mole before ?
okay , you 've seen me . now give me a towel .
oh ... well , i ... i just had to see you .
that 's because i do n't have a doorbell .
hello , mr. valiant . i rang the doorbell , but i guess you could n't hear it .
look , doll , if i wanted underwear , i woulda broken into frederick 's of hollywood . i was lookin ' for marvin acme 's will .
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir . maybe that 's what he was after ?
jesus christ ... < u > that < /u > was the judge ?
doom .
what the hell is that ?
that 's how he gets rid of the troublemakers . it 's a combination of acetone , turpentine and paint remover . he calls it the ... final solution .
what 's with the dip ?
no one knows . he bought the election a few years back . he 's been rulin ' toontown ever since .
where 'd this gargoyle come from anyway ?
wait here ...
what a gasser .
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin ' the other day .
just have n't been this close to toontown for awhile .
now what ?
that 's what you woke me up for ?
tell me you did n't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit .
there 's no time to take it easy ! you do n't realize the diabolical mind we 're dealing with !
take it easy .
you tricked me , damn you !
no , i do n't .
you got the will in there , do n't ya ?
no , you got ta understand , valiant , i had nothin ' to do with acme gettin ' killed . i just wanted to sell my studio . but they would n't buy my property unless acme would sell his . and he would n't . so i was gon na blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit 's wife .
well , everybody needs a hobby .
no ... i 'm not . i 'm a cartoon maker , not a murderer .
you 're not too good at this , are you , r.k. ?
that was the idea .
valiant ! you surprised me .
stop what ?
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock . if you 've got the will maybe we can stop this thing .
maybe . why ?
have you got the will ?
maroon ? whaddaya want ?
yeah , but i enlarged this one . thought you might be interested .
i 've already seen your photographs .
i just thought i 'd drop by and show you a photograph .
valiant ? what 're you doin ' here ?
hi , mr. maroon . remember me ?
sure , valiant , sure ...
son-of-a-bitch ... mr. maroon , i think i 'll be goin ' now , so about the rest of my fee ...
frankly , i 'm shocked . marvin acme 's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years .
well , you better start thinkin ' about drinkin ' it black .
as soon as is humanly possible .
when will i hear from you ?
are n't you the lucky one ...
i got him on loan from disney .
so 's the job .
a hundred bucks ? that 's ridiculous .
the job 's gon na cost you a hundred bucks .
you do n't have to . the rabbit 's wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink & paint club . you can catch her in action there .
i do n't work in toontown .
get me a couple juicy pictures . somethin ' i can wise the rabbit up with .
so what do you want me to do ?
here 's the problem ... `` seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit ... wife of maroon star , roger '' . his wife 's a tramp , but he thinks she 's betty crocker . the doubt 's eatin ' him up .
nah , that goes with the territory . he 's a stunt bunny .
one too many safes dropped on his head ?
yeah , and there 's no business as expensive . i 'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it 's all because that rabbit ca n't keep his mind on his work . and you know why ?
only there 's no business like it , no business i know .
how much do you know about show business , valiant ?
so what ? he 's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule !
he was blowin ' his lines , all right . so what ?
valiant , did you see the rabbit ?
from this box here ...
pretty good cigar . where 'd you get it ?
only time will tell .
and i 'm glad you got your sense of humor back . think you 'll keep it ?
by the way , roger , you were right about your wife . she 's a good lady . i 'm glad you got her back .
i guess i am at that . cigar ?
no , kid , you 're a real hero .
hey , it 's the will . i , marvin acme , of sound mind and body , hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo , do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters ...
keep reading ...
good idea .
i think you oughta read it to her .
yeah ?
say roger , remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink & paint club ?
yeah ...
that 's because it 's disappearing-reappearing ink . shows up three days later . gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he does n't punch you in the nose . great gag .
that 's not blood . that 's ink . that goof acme squirted me with some the other day . why it 's comin ' 'through now , i do n't know .
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage .
real good , rog ... but maybe you better let me take over .
i followed you to the maroon studios . when i heard those shots , i thought i 'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk .
what the hell are you doin ' in there ?
... i 'd head for cucamonga .
yeah ?
if i do n't make it back here by ten ...
i rest my case .
two bits .
how much is a shave and a haircut , roger ?
you know , eddie , i 'm not as much of a chump , and a patsy , a yokel as you think .
forget it .
i tell you what , maybe i better come with you .
that 's why i 'll be there at 8:45 .
gee , eddie , you 're not gon na go , are ya ? maroon 'll be layin ' for ya at nine o'clock .
no , it 's not .
wrong number ?
get away from there .
i 'll get it .
piano . guy got away , disappeared into toontown . nobody ever saw him again .
safe ?
yeah , everybody thought so . but me and teddy got a kick out of toons . all toons . we could n't see the bad in 'em . and when this guy was accused of knockin ' over the first national bank of toontown , we took his case . but when we looked into it , we found out he did do it after all . we went to his house to take him in . but he was wise . he got the drop on us ... literally .
him ? oh , he was vile , heinous , despicable ... a smear on the drafting board .
yeah , a toon . it was the guy who killed bambi 's mother .
a toon ? noooo .
you wan na know ? well , since you 're so goddamn curious , i 'll tell ya . one of you toons killed my brother .
gee , you shamuses are a tough audience , but what happened to you that was so dark , lurid , embittering ?
you damn toon ! no wonder they picked you for the patsy . always got ta play the fool . you make me sick !
what is this , twenty questions ?
gee , i did n't recognize you ... i 've never seen you laugh before . that your brother makin ' the rabbit ears ?
me .
say , who 's this guy laughin ' ?
we ca n't do anything till it 's dark .
so what 's our plan , our scenario , our modus operandi ?
my brother . get inside .
valiant and valiant ? who 's the other valiant ?
if i 'm so smart , how come i 'm runnin ' from the law with a toon ?
oh , eddie , that was quick thinkin ' . nothin ' like usin ' the old noggin , the noodle , the grey matter ...
drink it , jerk . all of it .
but , eddie , you know what happens when ...
here you go , kid ... say hi to casper for me .
i think you want a drink . how about it , judge ?
a blindfold , cigarette , noseplugs ? just kidding .
hey , does n't the rabbit even get a last request ?
well , right now it 's gon na be your funereal .
i 've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time . but you , edward valiant , are positively funereal !
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety .
a laugh can be a powerful thing , eddie . sometimes it 's the only weapon we have in life .
just because you got 'em to laugh ?
well ... i still do n't think he 'd turn me in .
an arsonist and a kidnapper . he just got outta prison .
angelo ? he 's a pal , a chum ...
and when they 're done laughin ' , they 're gon na call the cops . that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel !
but that 's my calling , my purpose , my raison d'etre . toons are supposed to make people laugh ... and believe me , those people needed a laugh .
why , you crazy toon ... i 've been out there riskin ' my neck for you . i come back here and you 're singin ' and dancin ' .
hey , do n't i get an encore ?
because he 's not forty feet tall . the safe was up on the ceiling , remember ?
well , mr. smarty-pants detective , your logic is specious . what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him ?
well , acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club . it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body .
how do you know that ?
yeah . except they screwed up . i do n't think they got the will .
the habeus corpus is thickening .
your wife may be a lot of things , pal , but innocent is n't one of them .
i resent that innuendo ! my wife is completely innocent .
yeah . i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind , your wife the sound body .
yeah ... well you just might get your wish .
my philosophy is if you do n't have a sense of humor , you 're better off dead .
are you always this funny , or only on days when you 're wanted for murder ?
well , no , not < u > any < /u > time . only when it was funny .
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time ?
yeah , that 's better .
does this help ?
do n't ever forget that .
sorry , eddie , i forgot you 're not a toon .
hey ! what do you think you 're doin ' ?
you idiot . i lost the key for those cuffs .
eddie valiant ... you 're under arrest ! just kidding ...
gee , eddie , i 'm a rabbit . we always run .
if you 're so innocent , why 'd you run ?
do n't do that ! i 'm innocent i tell ya . the police 'll just dip me . they were waitin ' for me when i got home last night . i ran .
look , pal , if you 're still here when i finish this drink , i 'm callin ' the police .
in other words , the whole goddamn world knows you 're here ! out ! get out !
well , i asked the newsboy on the corner . he did n't know . then i asked a janitor , the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way . he was very helpful .
oh , yeah ? then how 'd you find my house ?
do n't worry , eddie , no one knows i 'm here .
so i hear . even talkin ' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting .
i needed a place to hide . i 'm in trouble , eddie .
what the hell are you doin ' ?
aah !
aah !
divorce ? never !
my advice ? hop on over to reno , get yourself a quickie divorce .
baker 's man ... but no use ruinin ' a good pair of shoes over it .
pattycake ! pattycake !
uh ? uh ?
no better ?
if you do , sir , i am for you . i serve as good a man as you .
quarrel sir ! no , sir .
[ aside to gregory ] is the law on our side , if i say ay ?
do you bite your thumb at us ? sir .
i do bite my thumb , sir !
do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
i will bite my thumb at them ; which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
boo ! ah , ha ha . ooh . boo ! ha ha ha .
tempt not a desperate man !
then i 'll leave thee .
live and be prosperous ; and farewell good fellow .
tush , thou art deceived . hast thou no letters to me from the priest ? [ balthsasr shakes his head no . ] no matter . well , juliet , i will lie with thee tonight . i will hence tonight .
your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure .
leave me !
have patience !
then i defy you , stars ! juliet ! juliet ! i will hence tonight .
if she is well then nothing can be ill. her body rests in capel 's monument , and her immortal part with the angel 's lives . i saw her laid low . pardon me for bringing these ill news .
men 's eyes were made to look , and let them gaze . i will not budge for no man 's pleasure , i .
either withdraw unto some private place , or reason coldly of your grievences , or else depart . here all eyes gaze on us .
by my heel , i care not .
by my head here come the capulets .
thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in verona .
am i like such a fellow ?
keep away the cats ! thou art like one of these fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says , & quot ; god send me no need of thee. & quot ; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
the what ?
more than prince of cats . he is the courageous captain of compliments . he fights as you sing prick- song , keeps time , distance , and proportion ; he rests his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom : the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist ; a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause : the immortal passado ! punto reverso ! the hai !
why , what is tybalt ?
but alas poor romeo ! he is already dead ; stabbed with a white wench 's black eye ; shot through the ear with a love-song ; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy 's butt-shaft : and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
nay , he will answer the letter 's master , how he dares , being dared .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
romeo will answer it ?
a challenge , on my life .
tybalt , the kinsman of old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father 's house .
why that pale hard-hearted wench , that rosaline . torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
not to his father 's ; i spoke with his man .
where the devil should this romeo be ? came he not home to-night ?
romeo ! humours ! madman ! passion ! lover ! i conjure thee by rosaline 's bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh ! o , romeo that she were an open ass , and thou a poperin pear ! romeo , good night : i 'll to my truckle-bed ; this field-bed is too cold for me to sleep .
romeo ! romeo !
art thou hurt ?
forbear this outrage , good mercutio .
i fear , too early : for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night 's revels and expire the term of a despised life closed within my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death . but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail ! on , lusty gentlemen .
this wind , you talk of , blows us from ourselves ; supper is done , and we shall come too late .
but 't is no wit to go .
every man betake him to his legs .
not mad , but bound more than a mad-man is ; shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipp 'd and tormented . good day , good fellow .
by giving liberty unto thine eyes ; examine other beauties . why , romeo , art thou mad ?
teach me how i should forget to think .
be ruled by me , forget to think of her .
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
well , in that hit you miss : she 'll not be hit with cupid 's arrow ; nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold :
a right fair mark , fair cuz , is soonest hit .
a right good marks-man ! and she 's fair i love .
i aim 'd so near , when i supposed you loved .
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
soft ! i will go along ; an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
farewell , my cuz .
at thy good heart 's oppression .
good heart , at what ?
no , cuz , i rather weep .
alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , should , without eyes , see pathways to his will ! where shall we dine ? o me ! what fray was here ? yet tell me not , for i have heard it all . here 's much to do with hate , but more with love . why , then , o brawling love ! o loving hate ! o any thing , of nothing first create ! o heavy lightness ! serious vanity ! misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms ! feather of lead -- [ benvolio snickers ] dost thou not laugh ?
alas , that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
out of her favour , where i am in love .
of love ?
out --
in love ?
not having that , which , having , makes them short .
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ?
ay me ! sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ?
but new struck cuz .
is the day so young ?
good-morrow , cousin .
why then , o brawling love , o loving hate , o anything of nothing first create . heavy lightness . serious vanity . misshapen chaos of well seeming forms .
go to ! what , goodman boy ! i say , he shall : go to ; make a mutiny among my guests ? !
uncle , 't is a shame .
he shall be endured
i 'll not endure him .
content thee , gentle cuz , content thee . let him alone ; i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement : therefore be patient , take no note of him
't is he .
young romeo is it ?
uncle , this is that villain romeo , a montague , our foe .
why , how now , kinsman ! wherefore storm you so ?
what dares the slave come hither , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ? now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin .
here is my gold . worse poison to men 's souls , than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell .
drink it off and , if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight .
i pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
my poverty , but not my will consents .
the world is not thy friend , nor the worlds law . then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
such mortal drugs i have , but verona 's law is death to any that utters them .
what if this mixture do not work at all ? shall i be married then tomorrow morning ?
i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent . if , rather than to marry paris , thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death , to chide away this shame . no warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest . each part , deprived of supple government , shall stiff and stark and cold appear , like death . now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead . thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the capulet lie . in the meantime , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come . and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua . take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilling liquor drink thou off . i 'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to mantua .
be not so long to speak i long to die .
hold daughter !
if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this i 'll help it presently !
it strains me past the compass of my wits .
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter now . we must entreat the time alone .
are you at leisure holy father , now ? or shall i come to you at evening mass ?
and all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts . i dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that i revived and was an emperor . ah me , how sweet is love itself possessed when but love 's shadow 's are so rich in joy . news from verona . how now , balthasar ? ! dost thou not bring me letters from the priest ? how doth my lady ? is my father well ? how doth my lady juliet ? for nothing can be ill if she be well .
as the custom is , in all her best array , bear her to church .
farewell .
hie you make haste ! but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thau shalt live till we can find a time to blaze you marriage , reconcile your friends , beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred times more joy , than thou wentst forth in lamentation . quick hence ! be gone by break of day ! sojourn in mantua .
how well my comfort is revived by this .
o deadly sin , o rude unthankfulness ! this is dear mercy and thou sees it not . hence !
there is no world without verona walls , hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death . then banished is death mis-termed . calling death banished , thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me .
affliction is enamoured of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity . hence from verona art thou banished . be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
banishment ? be merciful , say death ; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death . do not say banishment .
wisely and slow ; they stumble that run fast .
o , let us hence ; i stand on sudden haste .
o , she new well . thy love read by rote and could not spell . come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i 'll thy assistant be ; for this alliance may so happy prove , to turn you household rachor to pure love .
i pray thee , chde me not ; whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow ; the other did not so .
for doting ; not for loving , pupil mine .
thou chid'st me oft for loving rosaline .
holy saint francis , what a change is here ! is rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken ? young men 's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes .
then plainly know my hearts dear love is set , on the fair daughter of rich capulet . we met , we wooed , we made exchange of vow . i 'll tell thee as we pass ; but this i pray , that thou consent to marry us today .
be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift ; riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me , that 's by me wounded ; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies .
that 's my good son : but where hast thou been
rosaline ? my ghostly father no ; i have forgot that name , and that name 's woe .
god pardon sin , was thou with rosaline ! ?
the last is true ; the sweeter rest was mine .
young son , it argues a distemper 'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed : or if not so so , then here i hit it right , our romeo hath not seen his bed tonight .
benedicite ! what early tounge so sweet saludeth me ?
good marrow , father !
sir , a ring my lady bid me give you .
i thought thy disposition better tempered ! thy juliet is alive . there art thou happy . the law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile . there art thou happy . a pack of blessings light upon thy back . wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth ? since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once .
romeo , come forth .
where is my lady 's lord ?
welcome .
i come for my lady juliet .
o , mighty is the powerful grace that lies in plants , herbs , stones , and their true qualities : for nought so vile that the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give , nor aught so good , but strain 'd from that fair use revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse : virtue itself turns vice , being misaplied ; and vice sometimes by action dignified . within the infant rind of this weak flower poison is resident and medicine power : for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part ; being tasted , slays all senses with the heart . two such empossed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will ; and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
juliet !
romeo , i drink to thee .
goodnight .
farewell . god knows when we shall meet again .
geth thee to be and rest , for thou has need .
no , madam . we have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow . so please you , let me now be left alone , and let the nurse this night sit up with you . for i am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business .
what , daughter are you busy ? need you my help ?
o god ! -- o nurse , how shall this be prevented ? what sayest thou ? hast thou not a word of joy ? some comfort nurse .
talk not to me , for ill not speak a word . do as thou wilt for i have done with thee .
o sweet my mother cast me not away . delay this marriage for a month , a week . or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .
here comes your father , tell him so yourself .
what ? now . st. peter 's church , and peter too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride !
marry my child next thursday morn . the gallant , young and noble gentleman , sir paris , at saint peter 's church , shall make thee there a joyful bride .
madam , in happy time what day is that ?
thou hast a careful father , child : one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor i looked not for .
she 'll not come down tonight .
o god . did romeo 's hand shed tybalt 's blood ? o serpent heart hid with a flowering face . was ever book containing such vile matter 's so fairly bound ? o , that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace .
well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much . go in and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father to father lawrence to make confession and be absolved .
what ?
amen
and from my soul too . else beshrew them both .
speakest thou from thy heart ?
faith , here it is . i think it best you marry with this paris . o , he 's a lovely gentleman . i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first ; or if it did not , your first is dead -- or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him .
then hie you hence to father laurence ' cell ; there stays a husband to make you a wife
i have .
have you got leave to go to confession to-day ?
here 's such a coil ! come , what says romeo ?
o lady dear ! are you so hot ? henceforward do your messages yourself .
where is my mother ! how oddly thou repliest ! your love says , like an honest gentleman , where is your mother ? '
your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , i warrant , a virtuous , -- where is your mother ?
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well . sweet , sweet , sweet nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
lord , how my head aches ! what a head have i ! o , my back ! other ' other side , -- o , my back .
but all this did i know before . what says he of our marriage ? what of that ?
well , you have made a simple choice ; you know not how to choose a man : romeo ! no , not he ; though his face be better than any man 's , yet his leg excels all men 's ; and for a hand , and a foot , and a body ,
how art thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ? is the news good , or bad ? answer to that ;
what haste ? can you not stay awhile ? do you not see that i am out of breath ?
i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news : i pray thee , speak .
i am a-weary , give me leave awhile : fie , how my bones ache ! what a jaunt have i !
o honey nurse , what news ? nurse ?
by and by , i come : -- to cease thy strief , and leave me to my grief : to-morrow will i send .
[ within ] juliet !
i uh , by and by i come -- but if thou mean'st not well , i do beseech thee --
[ within ] juliet !
three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed . if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word to-morrow , by one that i 'll procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite ; and all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
juliet !
madam , i am here . what is your will ?
i bade her come . god forbid ! juliet ! juliet ! juliet !
thus ... .. with a kiss ... ... i die .
romeo . what 's here ? poison . drunk all , and left no friendly drop to help me after . i will kiss thy lips . happily some poison yet doth hang on them . thy lips are warm .
o god , i have an ill-divining soul . methinks i see thee , now thou art so low , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb . o fortune , fortune . be fickle , fortune , for then i hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back .
i doubt it not . trust me , love , all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come . adieu .
then window , let day in and let life out . o , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes .
it is , it is ! hie hence , be gone , away . o , now be gone . more light and light it grows .
let me be taken , let me be put to death . i have more care to stay then will to go . come death , welcome , juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let us talk it is not day .
that light is not daylight , i know it , i. it is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to mantua . therefore stay yet . thou needest not be gone .
i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day .
mercutio 's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company !
come gentle night . come loving black-browned night give me my romeo . and when i shall die , take him and cut him out into little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun . o , i have bought the mansion of love but not possessed , and though i am sold , not yet enjoyed . o , tedious is this day , as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .
i will not fail : 't is twenty year till then .
by the hour of nine .
romeo ! at what o'clock to-morrow shall i send to thee ?
a thousand times the worse , to want thy light . love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , toward school with heavy looks .
a thousand times good night ! exit , above
so thrive my soul --
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it !
the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine .
what satisfaction canst thou have to-night ?
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
do not swear : although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract to-night : it is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden ; too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say 'it lightens . ' sweet , good night ! this bud of love , by summer 's ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet . good night .
if my heart 's dear love --
do not swear at all ; or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i 'll believe thee .
well what shall i swear by ?
o , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
lady , by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops --
thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak to-night fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke : but farewell compliment ! dost thou love me ? i know thou wilt say 'ay , ' and i will take thy word : yet if thou swear'st , thou mayst prove false . o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully :
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes , and but thou love me , let them find me here : my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
with love 's light wings did i o'er-perch these walls ; for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt ; therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
how camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ? the garden walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
neither , fair maid , if either thee dislike .
art thou not romeo and a montague ?
ahhh !
i take thee at thy word .
't is but thy name that is my enemy ; thou art thyself , though not a montague . what 's montague ? it is nor hand , nor foot , nor arm , nor face , nor any other part belonging to a man . o , be some other name ! what 's in a name ? that which we call a rose by any other word would smell as sweet ; so romeo would , were he not romeo call 'd , retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title . o romeo , doff thy name , and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself .
[ aside ] shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?
romeo , o romeo ! wherefore art thou romeo ? deny thy father and refuse thy name ; or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i 'll no longer be a capulet .
she speaks : o , speak again , bright angel !
ay me !
he jests at scars that never felt a wound . but , soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? it is the east , and juliet is the sun . arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she : be not her maid , since she is envious ; her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it ; oh cast it off . it is my lady , o , it is my love ! o , that she knew she were !
you kiss by the book .
sin from my lips ? o trespass sweetly urged ! give me my sin again .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
then move not , while my prayer 's effect i take . thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
well , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do ; they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this ; for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .
if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle sin is this : my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
did my heart love till now ? forswear it , sight ! for i ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
go ! we follow thee . juliet , blah !
speak briefly , can you like of paris ' love ?
nay , bigger ; women grow by men .
this night you shall behold him at our feast ; read o'er the volume of young paris ' face , and find delight writ there with beauty 's pen ; this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover : so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .
nay , he 's a flower ; in faith , a very flower .
verona 's summer hath not such a flower .
a man , young lady ! lady , such a man as all the world- -why , he 's a man of wax .
by my count , i was your mother much upon these years , you are now a maid . thus then in brief : the valiant paris seeks you for his love .
thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er i nursed .
nurse , give leave awhile , we must talk in secret . nurse , come back again ; i have remember 'd me , thou 's hear our counsel . nurse , thou know'st my daughter 's of a pretty age .
no ! mercutio !
a plague o ' both your houses .
i thought all for the best .
'twill serve . ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man . a plague o ' both your houses . they have made worms meat of me . a plague on both your houses ! why the devil did you come between us ? i was hurt under your arm .
courage man , the hurt can not be much .
ay , ay , a scratch , a scratch . ay , a scratch , a scratch . ha ha ha .
farewell , ancient lady ; farewell ,
i will follow you .
here 's goodly gear !
sure witt ! now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo ; now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature .
why , then is my pump well flowered .
right .
pink for flower .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
a most courteous exposition .
thou hast most kindly hit it .
meaning , to court'sy .
that 's as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
pardon , good mercutio , my business was great ; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
the slip , son , the slip ; can you not conceive ?
good morrow to you both . what counterfeit did i give you ?
signior romeo , bon jour ! there 's a french salutation to your french slop . you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
ho ho , capital punks !
ay , so i fear ; the more is my unrest .
away , begone ; the sport is at the best .
true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , begot of nothing but vain fantasy , which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north , and , being anger 'd , puffs away from thence , turning his face to the dew- dropping south .
peace , good mercutio , peace ! thou talk'st of nothing .
o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you . she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate-stone on the fore-finger of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies over men 's noses as they lie asleep ; her chariot is an empty hazel-nut her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat , and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love ; o'er lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , sometime she driveth o'er a soldier 's neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again . this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage : this is she -- this is she !
in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
that dreamers often lie .
well , what was yours ?
and so did i .
i dream 'd a dream to-night .
why , may one ask ?
if love be rough with you , be rough with love ; prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
is love a tender thing ? it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
too great oppression for a tender thing .
under love 's heavy burden do i sink .
you are a lover ; borrow cupid 's wings , and soar with them above a common bound .
not i , not i believe me : you have dancing shoes with nimble soles : i have a soul of lead
young hearts run free . never be caught up , caught up like rosaline and thee . nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance .
i am for you .
good king of cat 's , nothing but one of your nine lives .
what wouldst thou have with me ?
calm , dishonorable , vile submission ! thou art my souls hate ! tybalt ! you ratcatcher , will you walk ?
consort ? what does thou make us minstrels ? an thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords . here 's my fiddlestick . here 's that shall make you dance ! zounds , consort !
mercutio ! thou art consortest with romeo ?
could you not take some occasion without giving ?
you shall find me apt enough to that , sir . and you will give me occasion .
oh , and but one word with one of us ? couple it with something . make it a word and a ... a blow .
follow me close . gentlemen , gooday . a word with one of you ?
as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her , as that name 's cursed hand did murder her kinsman .
o , she says nothing sir , but weeps and weeps , and then on romeo cries and then falls down again .
sir . ah , sir . death the end of all
nurse .
bid her to come to confession this afternoon ; and there she shall at father laurence ' cell be shrived and married .
if ye should lead her into a fool 's paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say : for the lady is young ; and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing , and very weak dealing .
his name is romeo , and he 's a montague ; the only son of your great enemy .
is she a capulet ?
madam , your mother craves a word with you . come lets away .
as my american friend larry would say : are you fucking deaf ? it 's under your seat .
what ?
it 's under your seat .
to make a point . i do n't know her , and i was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk . i do n't particularly like you , so imagine what i 'll do if you try anything ...
why did you do that ?
you know it is .
do you really think so ?
this is important .
always in a rush , you are . all these years i 've known you , you could never wait for anything .
do you have it ?
i 'm up for that ...
i do n't know . i was thinking ... maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire , that sort of thing .
so where do you go from here ?
only the stupid ones . cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets . besides , i 'm not ira no more .
i do n't want you dead , woman , i want the the truth !
you go shoot me if you want , vincent , but you 'll be dead before i hit the ground .
and i do n't believe you ...
well i do n't !
when this whole thing started you made it clear : you 're running the show . and i do n't believe you 'd be running this show if you did n't know what was going on .
i do n't know .
finding this package is a thing easier said than done . we do n't even know what it is . what did we steal ?
of course .
very good . now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid .
and then sam , you and i clean up whatever 's left to be cleaned .
leaving ...
while sam and i take out the back two cars ...
is that right ?
we kept it ...
of course .
coordinate all you want , but make sure whatever you do gets cleared through me . are we in sync on this , vincent ?
i drink what every civilized man , woman and child in the world drinks : guinness .
oh yeah ? whatta you drink , then ?
budweiser ? you talk to me of beer and you 've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence ? that 's not beer ! christ , it 's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss .
best beer in the world ? budweiser for me , thanks .
best beer in the world known to man or god .
what is ?
some places , not all . italy , for instance , they 're serious about their food . but try bloody britain , anywhere in the u.k. , you do n't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg . food 's not our thing , you see .
this ... this is incredible . is the rest of europe like this ?
that 's why you were riding with him .
i never did trust that blonde fuck ...
how do we know that ?
and you believed me ? but it was n't my people who did it .
and then ...
then swede and i split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous .
which leads us to ...
you call me with the target 's route , i follow along until we 've reached the attack point and then i run his squag ass off the road .
the deal ? the deal is we leave for nice at first light .
so what 's the deal ?
and who are you ?
i drive -- and my name is larry . larry from the states .
the name is deirdre , and i 'm running this show .
who the fuck are you ?
it 's good to see you 've all got such faith in our little undertaking .
no , seamus . i heard you the first time .
do i need to repeat myself ?
shut up ! ! ! shut up and drive ! i 'm your superior officer and you will do as i goddamn well say , is that understood ? ! ?
you 're thinking with your gun , seamus , and not your head ...
plastic fucking surgeon ? you think i 'm going to fix this , deirdre lass ? it 's the mark of the patriot , and i 'll wear it like a badge . as for those who done it to me , i 'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over .
you better be careful , seamus , before something happens a plastic surgeon ca n't fix .
they 're good !
good christ ! ca n't you lose these jokers ?
not yet ...
about time !
you lose them !
lose them !
that 's him .
from interpol ?
they 're part of the team . one of them 's the guy i told you about .
what in bloody hell is going on ?
nothing .
would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there ?
problem my ass ! i think you 're lying to me , and if you are you 're a dead man !
i thought i did .
not to me , you know that .
it 's been known to happen .
so you thought that maybe i 'd grown too attached to this charade i 've been playing , is that it ?
it means i was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you . you 've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun , i might note . there 's no glory to it , but there are those that like it .
and what 's that supposed to mean , seamus reilly ?
now there 's the deirdre i know .
when we 're done with this , i want to do for that one myself .
come off it , sam -- if we were n't friends already we would n't be here now , would we ?
not me . you work too often with the same people and you become friends -- clouds your judgement .
alright ? it 's bloody fucking freezing in here !
are you alright ?
bloody fucking hell ...
i did n't say i was .
where do you get off saying word one ? all the time pretending to be one of us , it 's the same thing we were doing , seamus and myself . and here you are so high and mighty , like you 're so different from the rest of us .
do n't even think that i 'm buying that .
i 'm a patriate .
oh please..you 're on some sort of holy mission ?
well , if it is n't mr. interpol himself . i ca n't believe i misjudged you like i did .
that we 're too stupid to trace his calls .
check this out . gregor 's a spook , or he was one until recently . when he was a spy he lived the life -- you know , a prince in some eastern bloc country where nobody had shit and gregor had everything . then the wall goes down . no more cold war . and gregor is out of a job . no apartment , no special stores with western food and video tapes . i would bet dollars against shit that gregor liked that phone and he does n't want to give it up . and i would n't be surprised if he 's arrogant enough to think ...
i bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using , it was in his contract . cost a nice penny , too , especially that goddamned phone : gregor had expensive tastes .
exactly . gregor , he was the russian 's man . it was my people came up with the idea for this run , but the russians who had the capital to finance it . gregor , he was their insurance , and i was ours . everybody else was supposed to be neutral . gregor must 've got to swede ...
because if they had she 'd be gone along with the package , instead of sitting here with us .
i do n't know ... well i do n't ! it 's a goddamned mystery to me just like it is to you . but i do know who we 're working for . my people , and the russian mob .
now , what did we steal ?
just business .
duty calls ?
i better be getting that .
exactly . and last night i wanted to be with someone who was just like me .
you 're a hired gun , deirdre -- just like me .
i know i do n't have to , sam , it 's just that , for once , i want to . when i was a - patriot , it was a given i 'd sleep with any man it was deemed necessary for me to sleep with . you know : any man who needed setting up . sometimes so we might blackmail him , sometimes so he could be killed . sometimes so i could kill him myself . ira is n't exactly an enlightened feminist organization , sam . to most of the men i with i was always the girl . `` send the girl to do it . '' `` tell the girl to take care of it . '' `` have the girl fuck him . '' but i look at you and i get this feeling you take me for what i am : no more , no less .
you do n't have to explain yourself to me , deirdre .
look , sam , do n't take it the wrong way when i tell you we wo n't be doing this again .
i probably do . but for the time being , i 'm willing to forget about it ...
and when i consider that , i have to wonder if you do n't have some ulterior motive for being here , with me , right now .
nobody 's saying they do n't .
part of me says i should just look at this as a perk . you know , a bonus . but then i remember you 're you -- deirdre who used to belong to the ira -- and it occurs to me that deceit and subterfuge come very naturally to you .
that 's right .
is that right ?
i still am .
i did n't think to see you again tonight . you were pretty pissed .
i feel as if i 've wandered onto the set of enter the dragon . could you teach me to do that ?
we were n't real thrilled about it either ...
the two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information , and instead you went to fucking war ...
hazard pay ...
once .
you were a soldier , were you ?
sam . i 'm a weapons guy .
he 'll kill me anway , sam , shoot though me and kill this fucker .
shut up !
do n't do it , sam !
go ahead , shoot ... shoot and kill the bitch , i do n't care . and yet you do n't shoot . interesting . put down your weapon and walk away .
should any of you decide to rush me , i 'll kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time .
that fucking figures ...
there 's a problem ...
where 's the case ?
ready when you are ...
alright , gregor , i 'm ...
next .
i use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target . i trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through nice , relaying that information to you .
now then , let 's run through it one more time , shall we ? what 's your job ?
in this business , your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same .
but would you stake your life , that 's the question ...
i 'd stake my reputation .
you sure about this ?
i intend to . this phone is wired like no other : it 's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition , it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand . with my custom hardware and this phone i can trace the target 's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes ...
good , because it cost enough . there 's cheaper phones by far than that one , man : you better fucking use it .
it 's quite satifactory .
these days they they call me gregor -- and i 'm a tech . i do electronic work , surveillance , computer runs .
from here on in you want something you pay cash for it : no credit cards , no bank accounts are in place : ten percent up front , the rest when the job is done . you . what do you do and what should we call you ?
not likely . once , yeah , i was -- but there was n't an inch of profit in it , and i 'm a cash oriented girl , if you take my meaning . i 'm a hired gun , same as the rest of you , and that 's all any of us needs to know about the other .
who are you ? ira ?
i think not . after you ...
perhaps we could both go at the same time ...
you first , edvard .
do you have the material ?
really ? do you have the money with you ?
we 'll double your price .
i 'm sure . but i 'm sorry to say that it 's too late for trust : we have a serious problem .
that was a mistake , trying to kill you . mikhi did it without consulting me , i 'd have never allowed it .
i 'm touched , really , that they 'd send someone of your caliber . it 's nice to know that they did n't make the mistake of underestimating me twice .
yes , gregor , they sent me .
then you better find it in your heart to tell me , francois , because while your death is inevitable , it still is n't decided how painful it 's going to be .
in here ...
where 's my information ?
of course .
i take it you still want the money ...
if you say a word in english , vincent , my friend with the high powered sporting rifle will shoot you in the throat . sorry to screw you over like this , but the information you want might get me killed if i give it to you , and that 's a price i 'm not willing to pay .
what 's that ?
there 's been a slight problem .
here 's yours .
he 's a cop , vincent , he 's french and he 's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now !
what do you mean ?
bad company ...
he 's company .
not so fast . who 's that ?
do you have it ?
you 'll die if you leave here .
we 'll die if we stay here !
i 'll destroy whatever 's in the case .
and more importantly --
enough !
i 'm shocked , shocked to think that you 'd believe him .
edvard said the same thing about you before he died .
whatever you wish ... this has all been a terrible mistake , gregor . i wanted to play straight with you , but edvard insisted we try and kill you .
no , mikhi , i would n't . since i wo n't speak your language , and you ca n't speak mine , english will do nicely .
sit , sit ... would you like one ?
i think not . i have , of course , taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens . unless , of course , i deactivate it before it goes off .
figured enough to know there 's an odd man out and i 'm looking at him .
so , you 've got it all figured , do you ?
what 's a little hate between business partners ?
but you hate each other !
what am i doing here ? why , i 'm here to see my partners , gregor , the boys in the russian mafia . see , your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross . but they only just found out that what 's in the briefcase is completely useless without me . i ca n't fight them , and they ca n't kill me -- that means we 're gon na have to do business together .
you 've told me a lot of things , boyo ...
it is , i 'm telling you it is ! !
this better be the real thing or you 're a dead man !
i swear , it has to come here ! it has to ...
if you 're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being , i 'm gon na blow your brains all over this car .
a post office box .
sent it where ?
i sent it to myself in paris .
then where is it ?
i swear ...
bullshit !
i do n't have it with me ...
do n't talk to me unless you tell me what i want to hear , understand ? ! ? you have no choice in this , do n't think about winning , think about staying alive . i want the item , and if you do n't give it to me , i 'm gon na kill you .
now that is an interesting proposition .
so none of us knows who 's paying the freight , this is just some anonymous job . for all we know , we 're working for different people .
i got this gig through a contractor . and he most definitely did n't know who was doing the hiring , only that they were paying a lot of money ...
whoever hired us .
what i do is none of your concern . what you should do is wait for my next phone call . i 'm going to find a place where i can tilt the field in my favor . when i 'm ready , i 'll call you and tell you what i want you to do .
so what do we do ?
i 'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me !
it was a mistake , it should n't have happened .
much to your disappointment , no doubt .
gregor , is that you ?
it 's done .
is it done ?
i do , i do ...
i just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with .
i need you , swede , i ca n't do this without you !
really ?
nobody 's going to do that !
do n't cross me ...
what are you doing ?
what 's that ?
there is one other thing ...
then i guess we 're set .
that 's it .
a means to an end , is that it ?
i had n't thought about it . understand me , gregor -- i take no pleasure in killing . it does n't bother me one bit , but i do n't get off on it .
i would imagine that the great satisfaction in all of this will be killing the american .
because if there 's more than one party involved , if we really are working for different people , then perhaps some of us are on different sides . your orders might be different from mine .
how so ?
if he had n't you 'd have put a bullet in his head a long time ago .
how did you know ?
not exactly ? but close enough , eh ? so he saved your life , then ?
not exactly .
i 've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through . he 's a cop ?
of course . do n't you ?
and you respect him .
yes , sam 's tough alright .
he 's tough , your american friend .
hello , my friend . he does n't look french to me , vincent .
hello , jean-pierre .
a samurai has honor , a samurai live by the code of bushido , the way of the warrior . i 'm just a killer for hire . the world is n't about honor , anymore . it 's about survival .
you seem one to me .
vincent 's life is his own burden ; he 'll have to carry it for himself . and i 'm not any kind of samurai .
perhaps forged is a better word . like steel . like a sword . you 're a modern samurai . i 've spent my life around extraordinary men -- men like vincent . but i 've never seen anyone like you . i 'm afraid vincent will die if he goes with you .
created ?
i suppose i want to know how a man like you is created .
so what is it you want to know ?
perhaps . but you are not healthy , and if you try i 'll kill you .
if i was healthy , i could take that away from you .
call it a reckoning of character .
so this is what , a test ?
not a word . but no ordinary criminal would have the extensive military and medical expertise you do . and so i place the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense to me . you work for some government agency and you carry a gun , and in my world , that makes you a cop .
vincent told you that i 'm a cop ?
you suffered through an agonizing pain last night , pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law .
i did n't expect that he would .
he sees this differently , as you well know .
forgive my intrusion into your affairs , but i am the one who connected vincent to this job , his agent , if you will . he is one of my oldest friends and i owe him a great debt , much like the debt i suspect he owes you .
it gets done now or not at all . another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where i ca n't get them .
something important ? a thing that can not wait ?
yeah .
but first you have something to take care of ?
soon .
you should really let a doctor look at that .
some , thanks . enough to move on , for now .
then if you do n't mind ... i 'm gon na pass out .
do n't worry , we 'll take care of it .
you think you can stitch me up on you own ?
no booze ... pain 's in the mind , and the mind i can control . alright , let 's do it .
are you sure you wo n't have a drink ?
well , vincent 's american friend , shall we see what we can do for you ?
american .
did he bring that with him ?
what are you gon na do , call him up and ask him to give us back our shit ?
fine with fucking me , we got work to do . i do n't care what it takes , we are getting our property back and putting it into the hands of the people who are gon na pay us a great deal of money when we do . i do n't know about the rest of you guys , but i 'm not the kind of guy to just sit back and take it in the ass . i do n't mean that in , like , a literal way ...
it 's a cocktail . mostly demerol , cut with a little crank because we might need you awake in the real near future .
my way is better .
yeah , well ... my way works too .
why do n't you go do better , then ...
it 's been known to happen .
is that right ?
long enough to shoot back .
not for long .
all in the stomach , though . your man might live .
gets the job done .
you shoot alright .
anybody tries to unpleasant me i 'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes .
the point remains : we could be working for different people . there 's a chance for one of us ... maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others . i do n't know about you guys , but i like to know who i 'm working for . it can help prevent a great deal of ... ... unpleasantness .
i do n't think so .
i do n't particularly like killing , tubby , but i want you to know that this one i 'm going to enjoy .
not in mine .
it 's consider a virtue in some corners of the world .
is that right ?
you should learn a little patience .
where is this broad ?
i blast the lead car into oblivion ...
after we stop the target car i get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard .
eat shit and die slowly ...
i ride with fat-boy ...
who you calling dumb , dickless ?
and you could stand to get a little smarter , ai n't that right you dumb blonde fuck ?
i 'm just worried about your health , larry . you could stand to shed a few pounds .
who the fuck died and appointed you food czar ?
you should watch what you eat .
everybody .
who 's they ?
they call me swede .
i got a surprise for you , blondie ...
what a surprise ...
what 're you talking about , man ? i do n't understand .
just to keep me company , sam -- i hate smoking alone . how about you ? i thought all you ira types smoked .
i told you , i quit .
i guess that 's for the best .
gone . destroyed .
what happened to it ?
i do n't know . nobody knows , except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us . there 's probably a couple of guys back at the company who know , but i do n't think they plan to tell me anytime soon .
tell me something first . the package : what was it ?
you better get some sleep , alright ?
i know .
you do n't owe me a goddamned thing , vincent , and you know it . you stepped in front of a bullet for me . i owe you a heavy debt .
`` your field dressing saved his life . '' that 's three i owe you .
nothing ...
what of it ?
you speak french .
what ?
you son-of-a-bitch ...
finish it !
and now ...
finish the job ...
let 's get him out of here ...
i 'll work on it ...
you have to stop doing that !
no , i do n't .
do you have a good answer ?
that 's a good question .
and when you finish ? what then ? this package , whatever it is , do you give it to the cia ? do you really think they deserve it ?
and yet you would have killed him to save my life . you have a sense of honor , vincent , that i ca n't even remember anymore . i do n't know that i ever even had it to begin with . all i know to do , vincent , is to finish my job .
closest and oldest .
it 's the one thing i 've got left to hold onto . jean-pierre is one of your closest friends , is he not ?
why not ?
because i do n't walk away .
why then , sam , do n't you act like this is a job like any other ? surely , if you are a hired gun , you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for .
the mark of a true samurai . what i do for the company , vincent , is no different than what you do . we 're both hired guns , and this is a job -- like any other job .
why ? you 've got more force of will than anyone i 've ever seen . you handle a gun like it 's a part of you , you perform surgery on yourself without anesthesia ... and most amazing of all , you quit smoking , just like that .
would you stop with that ...
what of it ? samurai pain in the ass .
not just like that ... just before i turn around and it 's six months from now and the first thing i do when i wake up in the morning is light a cigarette .
just like that ?
time to quit .
if i 'm going to die for the cia , i 'm going to go out smoking . besides , there 's half a forest between us and them , they ca n't see a goddamned thing .
not here . they might see it .
yeah . we need out fucking heads examined .
do we need anything else ?
i think not .
in a minute .
if our positions were reversed , would you leave me ?
no you do n't , and you know it .
so i do it .
i know i do n't need to say this to you , but i need to say it to you . this is my job , i have to do it .
something like that .
business keeps you on the road ?
i 'm not here very much .
why are you driving ? you 're not french , you do n't live here , you do n't know these roads . why are you driving ?
gim me a goddamn cigarette ! ! ! !
right now ?
give me a cigarette .
you do n't know ? bullshit , you had her , there was no way out .
i do n't know ...
what the fuck happened ?
you said it yourself : gregor 's not dead . if they had the package , they 'd have killed him .
you think ?
they do n't have the package .
because i owe you . look at that ...
how could you have done that ?
i would have tried not to . but yes , if it would have kept him from shooting you , i would have .
you would have done that ?
i was waiting to see what would happen . i did n't want to kill him if i did n't have to .
you were behind the door ?
i know . jean-pierre did .
i never made that claim .
not very zen of you , huh ? not so much the modern samurai after all .
it is at that .
very ugly .
dark operations . wet work . kidnaping . assassination .
dark ops ?
i 'm a field agent -- last of an already extinct breed . i do dark ops .
it 's a cover , then . a cover within a cover , a feint within a feint . you work for the cia , it 's the only possible answer .
sure i do . you heard him , you heard the guy -- that 's what he said , what edvard said .
then quit . you do n't work for interpol , sam .
it 's my job .
continue when it would be so much easier to give it up .
do what ?
tell me , sam : why do you do this ?
if tony says this is it , then it 's it .
you sure your friend got the right place ?
thorough man .
the address of the russian production company . just in case we need to find them .
what 's this ?
yes .
the irish representative ?
i know of him .
you know him ?
good . now take the forceps , and remember , vincent , what we 're doing here is routine . i 've done stuff like this at least twenty times in the field . there are no vital organs where you 're working , no major muscles or arteries -- you ca n't kill me . just make sure you 've got the bullet before you try to pull it out .
clearly .
you see the bullet ?
alright , it 's done .
yes i do .
you do n't have to do this .
it is n't about money for me , not anymore .
this does n't involve you , do n't you understand ? i ca n't even guarantee you any money out of all this .
i 'm going with you .
we ? there is no we in my world now , vincent , just me .
it looks to me like we 're all that 's left of our group .
my job , vincent , a job you do n't need to know about . i ca n't go to the local cops -- they 'd never be able to get close enough at this point . it 's me or nobody , and i 've been on this job too goddamned long not to finish .
and what job is that ?
if i was a cop , a real cop , i 'd have busted you a long time ago . this is n't about you , it 's about the job i have to do .
you 're with interpol -- you 're a cop .
not exactly .
fix it yourself ? why are we even doing this ? there 's no need to run , christ ... you 're a cop .
no hospitals . i 'll fix this myself if i have to .
no ... i thought i 'd take you to the hospital .
you know one around here ? somebody you trust ?
you see it your way , i 'll see it mine . you need a doctor .
i did n't save your life back there . risked it , maybe -- but i did n't save shit .
that makes twice now you 've saved my life .
but you ca n't .
you 're a cop ... you 're a fucking cop ... i should kill you .
it 's paris . the route 's too indirect for anything else . a guy like gregor , he does n't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place . otherwise , he 'd be out of the country by now . he 's going to paris . now i just hope we can find him before he gets there .
not necessarily . he could go off road at any number of places . he might not even be in the country anymore .
he 's going back .
you might be a hired gun , vincent , but i got a feeling you cost more than two bits .
i never really thought i was part of the world you move in , sam , to tell you the truth . i 'm a hood , a thief . big time in a small time king of way . to the local police i 'm a prize , to the local hoods i 'm a legend . but to a guy like you i 'm just another two bit hired gun .
we live in a singular world , my friend .
i wo n't lie -- there have been times when i had to do it , times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man did n't .
you do n't . you just learn to live with it .
i have n't . not like that . how do you get used to it ?
i 've seen a lot of people die before .
a lot of people died .
it was at that .
i have a feeling i 'm about to start buying my own .
of course ... whenever you feel like it just help yourself .
i borrowed that , too ...
please , help yourself . smoke as many you 'd like .
i hope you do n't mind i took your pack . it was on the table .
you were smoking ?
i came up here to sneak a smoke .
you were n't around when i woke up , i thought maybe something had happened . this has been one very fucked up job , sam , and i 'm not taking any more chances on anybody ... including you ...
what 's going on ?
gregor 's cell phone ...
the question still remains : what do we do now ?
because that 's what i would have done ...
but how did you know i would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when i did ?
i saw you look off when francois nodded his head . i figured he was n't pointing out a particularly rare shrub , and the rest was easy .
that there was a gun pointed at me .
know what ?
how did you know ?
well i ai n't a cop .
i needed to see if you were a cop . i 'm a popular man with the police , sam , and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together . and that 's the guy you have to watch out for . i hate cops ...
you know , what you pulled back there , that was bullshit .
you need to know a lot of shit , vincent .
i needed to know .
see what ?
i just wanted to see something .
what 's going on ?
they 'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in new york , and it would still get fucked up .
lovely , is n't it ?
whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless .
they certainly are . whatever it is we 're going to steal , it must be quite something .
that 's right : there 's not hardly enough work these days , nothing that pays the big money , anyhow . then along comes this job , paying so much goddamned money i could n't afford not to take it . somebody 's paying through the nose for this .
you were once some kind of special forces . airborne ranger , maybe a navy seal . after that you rode shotgun for the cia in some place like el salvador or afghanistan , a real mercenary . only now -- now you 're like the rest of us , it 's a very competitive market since the end of the cold war . there 's a lot of hired guns out here , and not nearly enough work to go around .
who am i ?
i wanted to see who you were .
i 've wondered that myself . none of this answers my question , though ... why bring me ?
i wonder if she truly left the ira .
deirdre ? smart , yeah , and seriously goddamned dangerous .
so is the woman .
watch that one , he 's an ex-spook for sure , maybe stasi , maybe kgb . he 's smart , gregor is .
let 's just say i thought the conversational possibilities were limited . of course , i might have brought gregor , but he did n't seem like the right candidate -- for this .
exactly . why not bring them ?
like larry or swede .
so , vincent : why bring me along for the ride ? job like this calls for a warm body , somebody who can stand around and look threatening . a tough guy .
there is that .
it has it 's moments . course , you get cancer and die , that 's the down side .
christ , i smoke a pack-and-a-half a day , and i tell myself i could be worse . it 's just so damned pleasurable .
i do .
a cigarette ? as in one ? one cigarette a week , who smokes like that ?
i have , i do n't know , maybe a cigarette a week .
help yourself . since when do you smoke ?
one 's a lot more painful than the other .
what 's the difference ?
not at all . similar , but not the same .
same thing , is n't it ?
jujitsu .
that was a nice move you did on our young friend . judo ?
i asked if we could give him anything else .
what 'd you say to him ?
i do n't . but the language he 's speaking is universal .
i did n't know that you spoke french .
and i suppose he 's saying that we oughta give them something for using it , huh ?
something like that ...
as in , they own it ?
he says this is their block .
that 's what i thought .
pretty much what you 'd expect .
i can do that .
to see a man about a thing .
where to ?
things . this is my country , you know .
coordinate what ?
i 'm vincent . and i coordinate .
let 's just say he knows who i am .
he trusts you to lock up ?
no thanks .
cigarette ?
i know cops -- and you 're no cop .
perhaps the police ?
who else would you be ?
what makes you think we 're here to meet you ?
sorry i 'm late ...
seamus reilly .
last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address , name of seamus reilly .
gon na be tough .
it 's the irish tape we want .
cause the russian production company would be easier to find .
why 's that ?
i 'm sure .
you sure ?
gaelic .
it 's an international thing . several different peoples involved , criminals from all over the world , experts brought together to do a job . but maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the russian mob and the ira in bed together . an unlikely group of partners .
what 's the story ?
you slept with the fucker ! !
you put everything on the line because you ...
you should have kill him when you had the chance . but no ...
you slept with her !
how is it these fellahs managed to get the drop on us ?
you slept with her !
why did n't you kill him ?
why did n't you kill her ?
it 's a matter of respect . why do n't you wait outside , this wo n't take long .
i got ta try and overcharge him , he has to moan about the price , we settle somewhere in the middle .
tony and i have to talk some business , first .
i get the picture .
seamus reilly , boy 's a serious irish auteur -- a real firebrand . thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies , if you see what i 'm saying .
the russian would be easier .
can you get it ?
all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version .
you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape ?
what i 've heard so far , it 's all a lot of talk . i was n't so sure what to make of it at first , cause , like i said , the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix .
i might know where you could get a copy .
do you have the tape ?
matter of face there 's this flick i 've been hearing about . i have n't seen it , but from what i hear it 's pretty cool .
i was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new .
why do n't we step into my office ...
a friend . i was telling him about how you always have the latest tapes .
doing well . this is ?
i 'm alright . and you ?
my man , how you doing ?
do n't lie to me ! ! ! !
i do n't know what you 're -
shut up ! not another word out of you ! you 're going down , the feds know all about it ! you did n't know some of it was marked , did you ! where 's the rest ?
dwayne listen to me -
i should kill you right here ! i never thought you 'd do this to me but i guess there 's a lot i did n't know about you !
i ca n't get enough of it .
whatsamatter with you ? are n't you concerned about all of this ?
i want to get some hounds down here .
damn .
none of them had any --
i 'd like to know what they were doing in my town ! did you get id off any of them ?
looks like some kind of drug deal or something , they 're not from around here -- one of them 's still alive .
what the hell happened here ?
hey dwayne why do n't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin ?
sort of !
rock solid .
and you 're solid on that ?
uh huh .
that 'll bring me down , too . eventually . you got ta know that .
i ca n't . i ca n't go on . i ca n't keep lying ... killing . that 's not me . that 's not us .
just one more . this one knocks off all the rest .
it 's not about the money anymore . ca n't you see that ? it 's about
you 're the one who 's nuts ! there 's no one left to touch us , booth . we 're home free ! we just plant a little of the money on dwayne , and it 's all ours .
yes it is . i 'm calling it in . right now .
it 's not too late !
it 's too late ...
dwayne had the opportunity , just like us . he was at the scene . he grabbed the cash . of course . this is perfect !
what are you talking about ?
i know , i know . dwayne 's dead , but we can deal with it . we 'll pin it on him . the dea was driving jesse 's car . no car phone . no radio . they could n't have called me in .
dwayne 's dead .
what do you mean ? look . we can make still make it work .
no . it stops now . it stops here .
we got to get out of here . do you understand ? we got to get out of here right now !
he killed her ...
booth , listen to me ... booth !
he found us , he shot her ... he killed her ...
what happened ? what 's earl doing here ?
he killed her ... he killed her ...
oh jesus ...
then sally comes too .
that 's right .
we 've got to go now , then .
we 'll take the money and disappear ! we can do it , spend it on the move . even if all of it 's marked , there 's ways around it .
we 're not ? how do you figure that ?
no we 're not .
then we 're screwed .
i do n't know . they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays .
it was all used . random numbers . how can they trace it ?
i do n't know for sure , but why else would they head for the bank ?
i sure as hell hope so . let 's go .
do you have everything ?
come on . booth grabs the bag --
maybe we should say somethin ' .
yes i do ! it never woulda stopped , you know that . jesse 's always gon na be making mistakes and we 'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives .
you do n't know if he was really gon na --
we 're doing what we got ta do , to protect ourselves !
jesus christ earl ... what are we doing ? ...
like hell it is . this is jesse ! jesse !
it 's gon na be o.k .
you killed him ...
even if we have the tape , that would n't shut him up !
there it is ... now what about the others ?
here it is .
i 'm just making our intentions clear . go check the desk .
what are you thinking ? we were only supposed to scare him !
i do n't know ! shit , give me a break !
how long is it going to take ? !
who said anything about killing ? just keep driving straight ...
not bad enough to kill him .
how badly do you want that money ? ! how bad do you want to stay out of jail ?
you 're crazy .
i do n't know ... we have to shut him up somehow . booth looks at earl --
well what are we supposed to do ?
i do n't think he 's going to be doing any bargaining with us , the stupid son-of-a-bitch ! besides , i 'm not giving him a third of anything , not after everything we had to do .
maybe we can reason with jesse , give him a third in exchange for the tape .
if you 're any friend at all , you 'll stop talking like that !
look , earl . we got ta go straight . this is all messed up ...
neither do i .
no .
you think he 's bluffing ?
yeah , i mean you 're coming unglued , jesse .
you 're out of your mind .
well i mean it this time . come on . let 's get this over with !
you said that last time !
for christ 's sake , booth , i just needed to take care of a few debts is all ! you got my word on it -- i 'm not going near it again until everything cools down .
we had a deal ! what was i , talking to the wall ?
he 's a partner now , earl , like it or not .
he 's going to be trouble .
forget the copies ! he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original .
he 's probably made copies . he 's not going to give them up to us .
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape . we 'll set him up somehow .
and how do you figure we do that ?
i 've got a better idea . all we have to do is straighten out jesse .
... or get rid of the money . i do n't know .
well does n't he ? besides if the dea heard that tape we 'd be behind bars right now . just call it the cost of doing business . this whole thing is screwed up . i 'm thinking . maybe we should tell 'em the truth ...
well i 'm not ! thinks he 's got us by the balls .
all right enough ! i 'm tired of thinking about all this !
i could kill that no good son of a bitch !
exactly . this is our little secret , partner .
he would have done it to us , right ?
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
that 's not what i mean .
okay then . i 'll do it .
i ca n't do that .
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's just a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one .
i do n't know ...
what are you thinking ?
shit ! we 're gon na have to get rid of him . i 'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life . we ca n't risk it .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
man take it easy ! you 're sweating like crazy !
i should have known something like this was going to happen !
it 's the stupid thing to do , that 's what it is .
it 's the right thing to do .
are you nuts ? they 'll fry us for sure . there 's no way we 're doin ' that , you understand ? no way .
we got ta turn ourselves in , before they hear the tape .
oh , right , with a little help from his pals booth and earl . i 'm sure that 's gon na fly real far when they hear that tape ...
no we did n't . he died on his own .
we assaulted a federal agent . we killed him .
well , we did n't know that at the time .
that guy was a federal agent . an officer of the law , just like us .
i do n't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there ? ! we 're going to play it cool ... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway ...
this is n't a joke . what are we going to do !
i do n't know ...
we 're dead . we 're dead , we are dead ... what are we going to do ? !
forget it . we 're going to bury it , and we 're not going to even think about it until everything dies down . and no one , i mean no one hears a word about it . understand ?
fair enough , i 'll take it to my place .
look . dwayne was right . this is going to be a big story . so big in fact that i do n't want to even have this money around .
well we did n't kill him , he died on his own .
i do n't want to hear about miracles and god and all that ! we tried to murder someone to cover our asses !
i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
listen . do you want to go to jail ? taking evidence , tampering with a crime scene . you know what they 'd do .
that 's not what i mean .
okay then . i 'll do it .
i ... i ca n't do that .
well neither have i , but it 's us or him . if he talks , or writes a note , or whatever , he 's gon na turn us in . besides , he 's a low life scumbag . his kind is hardly even human anyway .
you 're thinking about killing him . i ca n't do that . no way . i 've never killed a man . never even shot at one ...
i do n't know ...
what are you thinking ?
i 'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail . we ca n't risk it .
he 'll tell them everything to save his ass . that 's how they all work it !
how long you been lying there playing possum with us , huh ? answer me !
he saw everything !
i do n't know ! son of a bitch ! who the hell are you ?
well , i do n't know . i 'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
what are you gon na do ?
shhh !
well , we wo n't do any of that shit !
we 're going to be patient . if we start flashing money around , buying fancy cars and fancy clothes , people are going to ask questions .
what 's that ?
i 've got one condition .
i do n't know .
we 'll leave a few packets in the trunk , and stash the rest somewhere else . car went up in the gunfight .
torch it ? !
we 'll torch the bases , how 's that ?
all right we will .
i do . it 's little shit like that sends people to jail ! we have to cover all the bases if we 're going to pull this !
maybe . who cares ?
all right hold on ! lem me think ... shit , did you touch the car ?
they killed themselves . besides , they were breaking the law . what they were doing was wrong ! whatsamatter booth , do n't you believe in miracles ?
at the expense of six people .
that 's right !
oh so god 's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks ?
it 's no accident we stumbled on this money . it 's an answer to a prayer ! every night and every day i 've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little , give me a little push . tonight my prayer came true .
because ... i know .
what makes you so sure ?
i 'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens , and it 's not gon na happen !
it 's going to go bigger than that . could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it ?
who 's going to question us ? dwayne ? jesse ?
suppose someone knows about the money ? they 're bound to ask questions .
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again , jesus !
we 'll figure something out .
i told trudy we were coming down this way , that 's why !
why ?
it wo n't work .
hell , it wo n't be us !
well someone 's gon na find them .
come on booth ! look at these scumbags around us . who 's going to know what happened ! let 's take it and get out of here !
we do n't know that .
robbed a bank , c'mon ! do n't you think we would have heard if one , two -- shit i do n't know how many were at large ! do n't you think there would be a bulletin ? this is a big ass drug deal !
we do n't know whose money it is ! they might have robbed a bank , who knows ?
look around you partner ! you said yourself you never saw anything like it .
no . we ca n't .
why ? are you kidding me ?
call it in i guess . why ?
i mean -- earl grabs booth 's arm --
what do you mean what are we going to do ?
what are we going to do ?
shit , more than that .
there must be over a million dollars in here .
ten thousand right here .
they 're out of towners ... arizona plates ...
what the hell ...
that 's what everyone thinks . but according to him , when it 's the real thing , it 's quite an intimidatin ' environment in which to concentrate .
i probably would have . i guess the clues damn near before everyone .
oh , you would have done great .
never heard of it .
cash and carry , you know , fdr , world war two ...
cash and what ?
he would have won more but he blew it at the end . did n't know what cash and carry was .
seven thousand ...
yeah ... i remember my brother-in-law gary , the wheel watcher . he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars ! plus some leather furniture . do you think i saw any of that ? his excuse was the government got it all .
i hear you .
i would have asked my sister , but its better to leave family out , always leads to trouble .
well i hope so . that pretty much cleaned me out .
thanks for the loan , man . i 'll have it in a few days , i promise .
the horniest dog in nevada .
how old is otis anyhow , thirty ?
i knew you 'd come through . jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave .
do n't spend it all in one place .
sure thing , and --
ready to roll , partner ?
what are you doing , earl ?
okay ! it 's under my desk ! ! taped to the bottom side ! ! !
whoa , earl !
helllllp ! ! ! !
shut up , jesse .
you 're only screwing yourselves over ! helllllp ! helllllp ! somebody ! ! !
do n't have much choice , jesse . you saw to that !
come on , booth . do n't let him do this ! ! !
you better believe it if you know what 's good for you !
you do n't expect us to believe that do you ?
no . it 's not .
i was beginning to think you were n't going to show . that ca n't be all of it .
i 'm not gon na take -- i 'm not gon na take it in stride . i had a good run turn to shit on me like that - cleaned me out .
just take it in stride .
well i do n't know what 's going to happen next -- she 's pressing this , another interrogation , another problem .
none of us like it !
i do n't like getting grilled by that dea bitch , i do n't like taking that kind of heat !
i want my share . all of it .
what are you proposing ?
there 's going to have to be a change in our arrangement .
by friday .
two thousand ...
i understand your logic , booth , but i do n't think ... two thousand 's going to raise any eyebrows , do you ?
how much ?
ok ... i 'll wait . for now . but i 'm going to need a little advance , to oil the wheels , so to speak .
that 's the deal . if you do n't like it , forget it , no one wins .
well , i do n't know ...
we 're going to wait . all of us , until everything dies down .
i 'm all ears .
all right , jesse , we 'll play it your way , under one condition .
besides , i 'm not stupid , earl . the tape was a basic maxell d-80 . you can buy 'em at any store . there 's no way they can pin anything on me .
my offer ? well i 'd say it 's a fair one , like i said we 're friends . all i want is my share , which i guess is ...
what 's your offer , jesse ?
listen earl . i covered for you . for both of you . i put my ass on the line to save yours , so do n't pull a hostile tone with me !
my point , well ...
why do n't you get to the point .
you gentlemen look like you 're about to toss your collective cookies .
it 's odd . i do n't know how denning had the time , or the ability to buy something local , based on his situation .
yeah ? so ?
denning was wearing a bug .
what 's that ?
well , we have one lead and that 's what i 'm looking into next .
yes . wife and a kid . do n't blame yourself , deputy . you did all you could . you have our deepest gratitude ... and my personal thanks .
you mean that guy was an agent ?
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap , but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys . the last we heard from him was two days ago .
maybe . that 's where it was during denning 's last report .
could it have been in the mercedes ?
because someone may have gotten away .
no . why ?
thank you . now , do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site , on your way to or from ?
hello .
how are ya ?
you know i do .
sally , do you love me ?
i swear to you , it 's true ...
i do n't believe it .
things just got a little screwed up , that 's all .
yeah . i want to tell you everything .
do you wan na tell me what that was all about ?
yeah , it is ...
yeah , i guess you 're right . it 's just ... all so sudden ...
we 'll meet new people . you might have friends out there you never met .
i do n't know . my friends ...
sally there 's a whole world out there . we can have a new home . a real home , not some tin-plated dump . what are you giving up ?
i 'm not sure why . it 's just , i 've never been anywhere else ...
why does that bother you ?
it 'll be more than enough . we can get out of here ...
can you rely on how much they said you 'd get ?
should n't be long . a couple of weeks maybe .
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out ?
i 'll be there for you . he wo n't try anything while i 'm there . i promise . i 'll protect you .
i do n't know , booth .
i 'm going to quit . that 's what has to happen first . then we 're going to tell him .
how are we going to do all this ?
well i was just throwing out ideas ...
a satellite dish ?
i love you .
i love you sally .
so do i .
it 'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us .
we 'd ... i do n't know ... go to california , new york , maybe a house on a swiss mountainside ...
i hate it when you talk like this . go on .
let 's just get out of here , get out of this -- place . we 'll drop out , get a house have some kids , get a satellite dish ...
i used to think he was something , once ... i was eighteen , i did n't know any better , and he had something steady to offer .
it does n't matter ... he 's next to you . you know , i always say to myself , you should have left him years ago . why did n't you ?
he does n't slobber , he just snores . and i told you we have n't ... done anything in over a year .
every night i think about you sleeping with him , him slobbering all over you .
i know .
dammit , i 'm so sick of this .
let 's hope so . sally if he asks me again , i 'm gon na tell him i returned it all .
it 's ok , booth , it 's no big deal .
great ...
he started digging through my closet , something he never does .
how the hell did he find it ?
i told him i bought the lingerie , as a surprise . i do n't think he suspects anything , but now you know , if he mentions it .
well , i ca n't let you down now , can i ?
you 're worth every last penny .
there is n't gon na be a next time . we 're gon na get out of here .
and i 'd end up a widow in two ways . let 's forget it . i 'll just be a little more careful next time .
and i 'd take it out on him .
let 's not get into this again . i know him . if you said something , he 'd take it out on me .
booth . do n't . it 's nothing . it 's not worth it . remember what happened the last time ?
that son of a bitch .
he 's not , he 's ...
like hell it 's over . you told me he was n't doing this anymore .
dwayne got a little tipsy is all . he does n't handle pressure well . it 's over .
nothing happened ?
what happened to your cheek ? sally oh i ... nothing ...
you deserve it is the occasion .
you got me something ? what 's the occasion ?
i 'm in here .
sally ? i was beginning to think he was n't gon na leave .
i love you too .
ok. i love you .
i 'm just tired is all . i 'll see you tonight ok baby ?
yeah i 'm fine .
are you sure you 're ok ?
ok .
oh . you coming by tonight ?
nothing 's wrong .
nothing .
what 's wrong ?
i know .
it was all over the local news . dwayne was there , acting all official .
yeah .
heard you had quite a night .
hi .
hi .
i might have to look into that ...
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours ...
no . but he would , probably .
has he ?
ah hell , he 'd do the same for me .
he 's irresponsible .
well , not that i would n't sugar bun but earl 's in a bind . they 're going to take his car .
yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three .
there 's an atm on speedwell avenue .
i got ta take some money out , that 's what for .
what for ?
i have to go to the bank before it closes .
thanks for your time .
a week ago , at most .
be more specific . a month , a week ...
could it have been this ?
i do n't remember . we get a lot of people in here .
what did he buy ?
yeah , i 've seen him .
first you question my integrity , then you call me stupid ... ... that hurts , son .
what is this ? do n't be stupid man ...
am i speaking english here ? how-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave ?
what ?
how about you give us what you have and leave .
and what 's that ?
i have a better plan .
what ?
i have a better plan . you want to hear it ?
you said that , i did n't .
you did n't answer my question . are you saying my word is of no value to you ?
business is business . now where the hell is it ? i wan na get out of here . that 's the plan , we 're just flunkies , you know what i 'm saying ?
sounds like you do n't trust me .
yeah .
test the product ?
hell , i do n't know . if i had some input i 'd offer it up .
what do you think about all this ?
this just might be our ticket !
i do n't know .
we had hounds down at the scene , the footprint trail was a bust . and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity .
what makes you say that ?
cause we got footprints leading into that brush , i want to see where it leads ... jesus , seven dead . i 'll tell you i 've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts . i do n't like it . not in my jurisdiction .
why ?
speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally 's meatloaf again , and i do n't think i could stand that .
do n't worry the real men are in charge now .
all right , deputies , take care , do n't let your meat loaf .
did you say after midnight ?
ok ... this is good . our first solid lead .
fine . the information does n't leave this room .
dwayne ... it is imperative that we keep this confidential . now we know someone 's out there . very close . it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner .
dwayne .
sheriff hogan --
well yes i understand that , we do n't want them high-tailing it out of here .
well you can understand why we did n't say anything . if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us .
have you known this all along ?
we do n't know . whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system .
mm-hmm ...
hell no . besides i 'm just a radio call away if something happens . i feel i should keep abreast of what happens , seeing it 's my jurisdiction and all .
do n't you have to be here ?
maybe i should come along .
oh that was agent wallace . we 're going to check into something .
because they do n't want anyone to hear what 's on it , obviously .
why would someone do that ?
well , unfortunately denning 's not here to tell us , but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it .
what are you getting at ?
maybe . maybe not .
do n't you think i would have told you that !
uh , no ...
we appreciate that .
well we 'd like to help you in any way we can . we 're all in this together , as law enforcement officers .
damn ! martin i 'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that . i thought maybe it would help . booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin , clearly relieved --
well nothing audible to us . maybe the lab can pick something up .
excellent . i 'll go down with you .
yeah . i told him i 'd be there before five .
that 's news to me . so it 's over at jesse 's office ?
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who 's who , what was said , what 's happening . i contacted your local coroner , and he found it taped to his back .
i wanted to ask you some questions about last night .
i guess we can get started .
sure ... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
yeah , racy stuff , you know the kind , right ?
lingerie ...
not exactly . it 's some lingerie store on the strip .
what the hell is that , some kind of porno store or something ?
yeah .
so there was money there ! who the hell 's money is it ? !
some of it . denning only handled a small portion of the total , but it looks like this was one of his bills .
is this marked money , or what ?
mr. curtis called us this afternoon . the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop . came through a store called after midnight . there 's only four employees , none of them can tell us who passed them .
oh yeah . between here and vegas we get a lot of customers . all types . even had an officer , just like you .
a lot of men come in here ?
oh , that 's ok , a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here .
i 'm just not very good ... with all of this stuff .
sure .
well ... i should have done a little homework , getting all the sizes , and what not .
no i do n't . you sure you havent seen her ?
do you know ... 34 c ? 32 c ?
yeah i 'd say c ... c .
c ?
uh ... c ?
let 's see ... do you know her cup size ?
oh .
no , i ca n't say that i have .
shopping here ?
have i seen her ?
i do n't suppose you 've seen her .
hmmm ...
yeah , she is . she comes up to about here on me .
we are having a sale on some items over here --
sixty five ... jeez louise !
well i do n't know ...
anything ... specific ?
i have an anniversary coming up , thought i 'd buy her something special .
well i just uh , you know ...
anything i can help you with ?
hi .
hello .
well , i just got a lot of things on my mind is all .
you walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich .
no . something wrong with you dwayne ?
something wrong , jesse ?
well i 'm here now .
nice of you to join us . i did say three o'clock , did n't i ?
yeah ... see you at three .
i have complete faith in you . but do n't you go speeding .
i 'll do my best ... that does n't give me much time .
so be here at three .
uh , sure . i hear you .
well they really did n't go into any details on the phone , but they did ask for you , and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can .
about what ?
well , we got the dea coming down here again , i do n't know , sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us .
why ?
vegas ! can you hightail it back here by three o'clock ?
i 'm at a payphone in vegas . what 's up ?
yeah whaddya want ? .
jesse ?
yeah . that 's all i need , to become one of your in-laws .
she 's not his type .
sort of .
do you even have a girlfriend , jesse ?
take it or leave it .
aw , now thats gon na take time to clear !
dammit youre persistent . i dont want to listen to this anymore . no more bets with you .
no . but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me , and im a busy man .
all right youre the super sleuth , what do you want , a medal ?
very clumsy , very clumsy . id have found it in a minute .
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow , no drugs in her system , no foul play .
damn its hot in here ...
i mean at least pick a more discreet place , the scalp , under the armpit , under the tongue , someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look .
just goes to show you .
calm down --
dwayne please calm down !
you 'd do this to me !
dwayne -
you 'd do this to me ? !
shut up ! ! ! slut ! ! !
dwayne put the gun down --
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch !
it certainly is ...
save me the sermon . i 've heard it all before , it 's boring .
no , dwayne , you go ahead and relax , have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv , and come upstairs and pass out . and do it all over again tomorrow !
look i worked all day , i 'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace ! is that asking too much ?
whatever ...
well i got the tires rotated , i went shopping , and i made dinner .
yeah let 's hear about your day .
do n't you want to hear about my day ?
just trying to be civil dwayne .
well you might as well say it . mister small time ...
i did n't say that . you did .
suppose i 'm not exciting enough for you .
that has n't stopped you before .
not much to tell . nothing really happened .
nothing . nothing 's the matter . sally are n't you going to tell how your day went ?
watch that . watch that tone .
i 'm saying you 're about as romantic as a bag of sand .
what are you saying ?
a surprise huh ? well i do n't like any surprises , especially if i 'm forking over the loot for them !
it was going to be a surprise !
forget it .
i ca n't hear a word you 're saying !
where 's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing ?
what ?
hey where 's the hot pad ?
i do n't know ...
what 's this ?
stop ! stop ! i do n't need the money . you can have it all .
easy to purchase , hard to detect . too much potassium can kill a man . just have to ... pick a discreet spot .
we got ta , jesse . it 's tough , but you did n't leave us any choice . we got ta know where the tapes are .
do n't hurt me .
well it 's not here -- you 're wasting your time and you 're pissing me off !
i do n't suppose you 'll tell us where the tape is .
we 're gon na talk .
what the hell are you doing , you crazy some bitches --
i think i am .
you 're never getting that much .
you want to see how more unglued i can get ? try me .
well you ca n't have it .
so i want the money and i want it now .
oh jesus christ ...
i was on a roll ! im a little overextended now .
what do you mean ? you gambled it ?
listen -
well you 're not getting , either .
i 'm not asking .
just do it ! meet me there , now .
what ?
meet me at the tumbleweed diner .
right behind you .
we 're out of here .
true , but neither is attempted murder . in fact i 'd say that 's considerably worse , would n't you , earl ?
and if we refuse ? your tampering with evidence is n't exactly a misdemeanor , did you ever consider that ?
i 'll settle for a third of that .
then what the hell are you all about ?
hey we 're all friends , right ? friends do n't squeal on friends , that 's not what jesse segundo is all about .
absolutely positively .
thank you honey . are you sure you do n't want it ?
you 've done without it long enough , ma .
well i do n't know --
ah , hell i 'll get one soon enough . besides , i want you to have it .
do n't you want it ?
yeah . figured you could have it .
this whole place ?
yep , fifteen thousand btu 's , enough to cool off this whole place .
that 's great earl !
and not just any air conditioner . this baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail .
well what do you know ! an air conditioner .
well basically i forgot about it , you know , you never win these things , but this time , well ...
and what happened ?
there was this raffle going on at the station , some charity or church was running it , i forget , so i figure what the hell put in my five bucks ...
you do ?
yeah sure i 'll grab something before i go ... hey -- i 've got a surprise .
are you hungry ?
at least around here it does .
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent .
nope . if you 're a criminal you do n't carry id , and if you do you 're a damn fool .
did they ever find out who they were ?
it was pretty gory ma , let me tell you . but you have to turn all that off , and do your job , just like pop used to say .
people have been asking me about that story in the paper . i told them you were the first person on the scene . they were asking me for all the details .
well , same ol ' same ol ' .
how 's work ?
yeah .
is that the mail ?
i was in the neighborhood .
i did n't know you were coming .
hi .
hi ma .
not getting an answer ? for christ 's sake ! call 911 ! let 's get it locked down here !
i 'm not getting an answer .
this is n't right ...
what do you think ? heart attack ?
yeah .
we 're going to find out .
you think he skipped town ?
i knew it , i knew it all along - shit !
he did n't make it into work , and he 's not home .
we 're doing a check on the manufacturers' serial number , see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch . what 's your take on these local boys ? are they providing any answers ?
no , it does n't . neither does his blank tape . any news on that ?
i do n't know how else you 'd explain it . the coroner 's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started , unless of course denning started it , and that does n't make much sense .
so someone did get away .
that fire was set . deliberately . and probably not by anyone found at the scene .
so ... what 's the good news ?
yeah , we did . it was unleaded , high octane .
that does n't tell us much . did you run a check on the gas like i told you ?
not in the trunk .
there was more than that .
but nowhere near three million dollars worth . i would say maybe twenty thousand .
money .
anything in it ?
we retrieved a few things from the trunk , including a steamer trunk , or the remnants of a trunk , the brass clips and so forth .
give me the bad news .
you want to hear the good news first , or the bad news ?
sir , i 'm working on a big case over here -- and by the time i get back they 're gon na make you governor . captain , you there ? hello ? shit !
no , carter . the reason i 'm screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong . and what the hell is heaven on earth ?
is it because of the hookers , sir ? you tell them there 's no crime in being lonely .
i 've waited my whole life for this job , but i do n't have a shot in hell of getting it . do you know why ?
two hundred cops ? was mario sanchez there ? he owes me money .
do you know what happened yesterday , carter ? i was officially nominated for the commissioner 's post for the lapd . there was a dinner last night , two hundred lapd officers were there .
did i say dinner ? i meant diner . biscuits and gravy , you love that shit .
it 's nine-thirty in the morning .
hong kong ? i 'm not in hong kong . i 'm in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine , two minutes from the station . how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner ?
is it true , carter ? are you in hong kong right now ?
i 'm up a hundred and fifty-grand . that 's a ferrari . do they sell those here in the gift shop ? somebody cash me out !
winner ! four , winner !
two-hundred thousand dollars ? who wants a hundred dollars ?
two-hundred thousand !
how much is that ?
winner six !
everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips , but the black man gets the nickel , is that it ? did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips ? do i look like chicken george to you ?
no , sir .
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll , is that right ? are you a racist ?
no , i just assumed ...
did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because i 'm black ?
those are five hundred dollar chips .
what the hell is that ?
mr. tan is not to be disturbed by the help .
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced . tonight i 'm doing superfreak , i do n't care what he says . where is he ?
wait .
i got held up at a wedding in tai koo . ricky here yet , i need to get his requests .
the band has been playing over an hour .
i 'm with the band . i 'm the lead singer .
invitation , please .
all right , kenny . thanks . you 're off the hook . for now .
i knew it . the guy 's name is zing . he works at the kitchen at reign plaza .
one of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week . i was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up , when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing . including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills . i knew something was wrong . cause this guy 's got a regular job , no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash . but i tested the bills , infrared . the whole thing . and they checked out . 100 % .
what ?
yeah . we already been there . this is big , kenny . benjamins . secret service calls 'em superbills . banks ca n't even tell the difference .
i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too , did n't you ?
so tell me what you know .
you 've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning . how come you always save me for last , james ? when are you gon na learn . shit do n't happen i do n't know about .
how 'd you know ?
is this about the funny money ?
look , i need some info and i do n't have time to play around .
i 'd like to see you try .
jail ! ? james , you better back off . badge or no badge , i 'll kick your ass .
little chang is gon na have to go visit his daddy in jail if you do n't cooperate .
james , you see my kids back there ? you know how much i 'm paying for private school ? how can you come in here with this attitude , you being little chang 's godfather ?
and i got mine , meaning you . nice how that works out . i 'm serious this time , i 'm closing this place down .
i got my sources .
what ? ? where 'd you hear that ?
hear you got your ass kicked in hong kong , james .
the real question is , where are the plates ? if we can find the plates , we can stop the whole operation .
what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money ?
they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red -- the real ink burns black .
in 1959 , the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran . we wanted his oil , so for the shah 's birthday , the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press . the only one to ever leave the country . five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market .
how 're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses ?
it 's much more than a counterfeit . 14 out of 15 world banks ca n't tell the difference . the paper is crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses .
it 's a myth . some kind of counterfeit .
they think i 'm a crooked customs agent .
so what 's your story ?
look , i 've been working this case for months now ...
we need to get out of sight . come down to my suite .
yeah , that 's right .
how do we know you 're not lying ? let me see your badge .
i 'm an undercover agent for the united states secret service .
throw us in jail ? i 'm about to bust you right now .
you see , no bomb . now stay away before i throw you both in jail for obstruction .
your friend 's ship ? oh , man . i must 've walked onto the wrong yacht . i knew there was a reason my keys did n't work .
i 'm sure , because this is my friend 's yacht . and it 's his party .
red dragon ? you sure about that ?
the s.s. minow johnson . funny , the name on the back was `` red dragon . ''
called ? what 's my ship called ? well ... it 's called the s.s. minnow johnson .
well , i 'm very tempted . it 's such a beautiful yacht . what 's it called ?
i do n't want to play games with you , isabella . i like you . i can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes .
el capitan ?
that 's right . i 'm the owner , the captain -- you can call me el capitan .
this is your ship ?
i 'm sorry , you looked like you traveled in the best circles . but hey , i understand . make yourself at home , isabella . champagne , caviar , whatever you want . my ship is your ship .
i do n't think so .
san juan ! you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo .
isabella molina , from san juan . that seat is taken .
how you doing , baby ? my name is prince mubutu from nigeria .
c'mon , lee . he 's going to jail . you won , now just put the gun down .
do you have it in you , lee ? or are you gon na spend the rest of your life hiding like your father ?
lee , you okay ?
would you like me to tell you how your father died ?
i ai n't his partner , i 'm a tourist . i got proof . see , i got a mini-bar key .
could you have your partner wait for us outside ?
that 's chief inspector , he got promoted .
it 's no problem . but i must excuse myself , inspector .
i 'd like to pay you for that laptop .
i do n't think so ...
let 's go . i 've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me .
i 'm lee 's new muscle , his right arm -- and do n't let the robe fool you . this is the only color they had left . now get up !
i know you , detective carter , right ? you 're lee 's american friend . enjoying your visit ?
i said get on your feet !
i 'm busy at the moment .
she is nice . but i am very tense . i 'm gon na need a lot of massages . i 'll take that one , too . how you doin ' , baby ? and ... that one in pink . she can do my feet .
oh yes , she 's very nice .
any girl ? okay . let 's start with that one .
you pick any girl for you and your friend .
no . it 's my first time .
you get massage from chinese girl before ?
never leave home without it . lee , this one 's on me . you save your money .
you bring american money ?
that 's right .
oh , you american ?
you play games with me , detective , and you 'll lose every time . do n't forget . the odds are always in favor of the house .
you 're right , you 're a smart guy . most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar . but this is an even swap . pure genius .
vegas has been my town for 30 years . i crawled out from under the first rock . do you really think you can intimidate me here ?
lem me ask you something , steven . and i want the truth . is there any way i can date your daughter ? just dinner and a movie , maybe go listen to some jazz ...
detective carter , you always seem to show up where you do n't belong .
stevie , how 's it going my man ? somebody get a picture , we can use it for a mug shot .
i 'm just in town for the weekend , taking in the sights .
wait a second . you 're steven reign ? you 're big time . you own all them big hotels . what are you doing in hong kong ?
amen to that , brother .
i could use a little vacation .
some kung-pao ?
a little mu-shu .
the plaza hotel ?
first class .
new york city ?
i always wanted to go to madison square garden . see the knicks play .
come on , lee . stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up . there must be something you want .
this money is evidence .
they owe us , man . that 's the least they can do .
it 's okay , i got lots more .
no , carter . i ca n't take this .
about fifty grand . i won it at the tables .
what is this ?
it 's okay . i can finally let it go .
your father 's badge ? no way , man . i ca n't take this .
you take care of yourself , lee .
i guess so . thank you , carter .
i 'm this way . i guess this is goodbye .
yes .
that your gate down there ?
she 's going home to new york . i need some ice .
i saw that . she kissed you , did n't she ? you played it cool , though . walking away , never looking back .
no problem .
we made it , man .
it 's worth it to me .
lee , wait a second . it 's not worth it , man . he 's making you do this .
just go !
carter ...
you go after ricky . i got this .
we have to get to the penthouse .
what ? ! ? !
ricky tan is alive .
yes i did . i said mmmmmm !
no you did n't !
i did !
why did n't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth ?
mmmmmm ! ! ! !
lee !
i 'll give it my best shot .
try to keep them busy for five minutes .
i 'll go to the craps table , make a big scene . when security comes over , you make your move .
wait a second . there 's guards all over the place . you 'll need a distraction .
no . i 'm going to find out .
isabella ? are you crazy , man ? she almost got us killed . she 's setting you up again !
it was isabella . she says the plates are in the soft count room .
dancing ? i 'm out here trying to strong arm steven reign , putting my life on the line , and you 're up here dancing with some bimbo . did she have a friend ?
dancing ?
lee , what the hell are you doing ?
wait here . i 'll handle this .
carter ... here comes the rich white man .
buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy . the man has the biggest tits in asia .
buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune .
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell .
yes . we have lots of big men chasing us .
couple ? no , you got it wrong , there 's no couple here . just two single police officers working a very dangerous case .
follow me my asian brother .
what is mac out ?
wait a second . we ca n't go in like this . look at this place , we got ta look fly . we got ta mac out .
let 's go .
that was the name of ricky tan 's boat .
red dragon .
lee . i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash .
vegas ...
do n't you talk about my mama . that 's more like it .
you could never kick my ass . you mama 's boy .
oh no you do n't . do n't you be getting corny on me , lee . i 'll kick your ass from here to compton .
you 've been a good friend , james carter .
end of the line .
we 're slowing down . this must be it .
now that i believe .
yes he did . he also invented the bicycle .
no chinese man discovered electricity .
a chinese man discovered electricity .
benjamin franklin , he discovered electricity .
who 's benjamin ?
hello , benjamin .
i 'll remember that next time i 'm fighting a box .
it 's focus . every opponent has a weak spot . you ignore everything around you , and put all your energy into one perfect strike .
very nice .
go ahead . sing your ass off .
they 'll probably torture us first , shock our privates , then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head .
that depends . how do the fu-cang-long usually kill their victims ?
i knew it . what does she know . you want me to sing something ?
as long as you 're asking ... i think you have a pretty good voice .
forget it . it does n't matter .
are you serious ?
tell me the truth , carter . do you think i have a good voice ?
that 's rough , man . if i do n't get steamed dumplings once a week , i go crazy .
once in a while , steamed dumplings . but only when she was drunk .
steamed dumplings ?
no kung pao chicken . never .
what about a little king pao chicken ?
no mu-shu .
you 're kidding . no sex ? nothing ? no mu-shu ?
there was no sex . she was very traditional . we were waiting until we were married .
how was the sex ?
mind your own business .
if she was the right girl , you 'd be thinking about her .
no .
you thinking about that girl that dumped you ?
fine by me .
i think we should stop talking .
i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues . they do n't let everybody in .
what 's a chinese heaven ?
is it the same heaven , or is it a chinese heaven ?
yes . we have heaven .
i believe in heaven . you people believe in heaven ?
fine .
i do n't believe in reincarnation . so i wo n't see you in the next world .
see you in the next world .
i wo n't talk to you , you do n't talk to me . we 'll die in peace .
fine with me .
you got that right . and we ai n't brothers . maybe we should just end this right here .
well we 're not friends .
we are not partners . between your daddy , my daddy , and the beating i just took , as far as i can tell all partners get you is dead .
i 'm not used to having a partner .
it does n't matter .
why did you help me ?
i 'm about to be killed and you `` shhh '' me ! this was n't my case , lee . ricky tan did n't kill my father , the fu-cang long are not in south central . i did n't have to help you .
shhh , my head hurts .
look , man i 'm sorry . i know you got a thing for her .
for how long ? face it , lee , she 's playing both sides .
she saved our lives .
what 's the first thing i told you -- never trust nobody . how could you fall for that shit ? i knew she was dirty .
are you okay ?
snoopy is about six inches taller than you . i 'm sorry , lee , you never had a chance .
i am not third world ugly . women like me , they think i 'm cute . like snoopy .
you 're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me . i 'm tall , dark and handsome , you 're third world ugly .
she never even looked at you .
they do n't know that . what are they gon na do , try and shoot the president during the interview ? i 'll bet isabella can pull some strings . you saw the way she was staring at me .
we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else .
secret service agent carter . this is my calling , lee . give me six months and i 'll be in washington protecting a white guy .
we can help you . i 'm a detective in hong kong .
let me see it again ?
it 's a bomb .
i would n't do that ! ! !
take it !
get it out of here !
there 's people up here !
wait ! there 's people down there !
i do n't need a turn !
it 's your turn !
pick it up !
she 's walking back towards the door .
i do n't understand ?
no , i do n't believe this shit -- it 's a microphone . lee , she 's wired ...
what is it ?
she 's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg . oh , god ... please do n't let it be a dick .
what ?
wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs ?
she just took her hair down . now she 's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she 's using both hands . you better get that ice .
snoopy ? i love snoopy .
skirt just came off . she 's in black bra and panties -- victoria secret spring catalogue , page 27 -- wait a sec - there 's a tattoo on her left thigh ... it looks like snoopy .
i do n't want to hear this .
oh , sweet glory hallelujah ...
what 's she doing ?
gim me the binoculars or i will shoot you .
no . it 's not right .
gim me the binoculars .
she 's getting undressed .
what 's going on ?
i 'm gon na go in the hall and get a bucket of ice . you want some ice ?
hot ? i 'm freezing my ass off .
is it hot in here ?
nothing . i said nothing .
what did you say ?
slow down , baby .
i 'll try to stay awake . it 's so boring .
just do n't fall asleep . sooner or later something 's gon na happen .
she 's just standing around -- not doing much .
she hated my voice . said it drove her crazy . i sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - i thought she liked it . she finally told me it was driving her crazy .
excuse me ?
no . it was my singing .
let me guess , she could n't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive . i 've seen it a million times .
it 's a long story .
i 'm sorry , lee . why did she leave you ?
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding .
you pull a muscle or something ?
the truth is , i have n't had any mu-shu in six months .
hey , i did n't mean to call you pathetic .
carter , there 's something i have to tell you . you were right about what you said in hong kong . all i do is work . never take a day off . it 's all i have right now .
look at her . now , wake me in an hour , i 'll take over .
how do you know ?
he 'll be back soon .
he just left . kissed her on the cheek .
yeah , that 's definitely the woman from ricky tan 's boat , and she 's staying in his suite at his hotel , i told you this would work out . they still just talking ?
the same place you find all richwhitemen . gefilte fish . lox and bagel . i love this stuff . here , try it with a smear .
just tell me where i can find this steven reign .
yeah , what about when godzilla was coming ? you people were screaming your asses off .
maybe . but not like asians . we never panic .
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down .
you sound like that all the time .
because when the shooting started he was way too cool . see most white people , when there 's shooting , they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like `` aaaahhh ! ! ! aaaahh ! ! ! !
how do you know he 's our man ?
big hotel billionaire . he was on ricky tan 's boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked .
who ?
not bad . now every crime , somewhere , has a rich white man taking his cut . every single one . now in our case , we know the rich white man is steven reign .
follow the richwhiteman ...
almost , but you 've got to say `` rich white man '' all run together like it 's one word .
follow the rich white man ?
lee , let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation : follow the rich white man .
i should go back . ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor ...
i guess you 're going to have to trust me on this one .
why la ?
you want to figure out why they killed your daddy , get on the plane .
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father 's death , i 'd go to hell to do it .
you said --
it sounds impossible --
i can not go to la ...
come on , we still got time to order the kosher meal . always get the kosher meal , they bring it first .
what ?
so are you getting on the plane or not ? !
i know . i know . i am sorry .
it is crazy !
i thought you 'd think it was crazy .
you thought the `` customs agents get blown up '' and `` smuggling '' and `` ricky tan '' and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case . that 's why you did n't tell me what we were doing ...
no , no , that would be crazy --
this is about your daddy 's death ? hell , lee , you know my father died on the job . you could have told me ... this is about more than all that , is n't it ? this is about your daddy 's last case , right ?
all the evidence against him disappeared , the smuggling case was unsolved . tan resigned and went over to the triads openly .
how the hell did tan get away with it ?
he found out his partner , tan , had been working for the triads all along . before my father could prove it , he was killed in the line of duty .
ask me if i give a shit .
five years ago , my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case .
forget it .
good at what ?
you 're not very good at this , are you ?
no . she 's a school teacher .
i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw .
do n't be talking about my mama . or my ass !
give me your best shot , you flat assed mama 's boy .
i 'll bitch slap you into bangkok .
what are you gon na do about it , grasshopper ?
what the hell is going on here ?
remember i told you my father was a policeman ? ricky tan was his partner for ten years .
why the hell should you believe him ? he had us beat up . naked . that 's nasty shit .
i 'm okay , you go .
what , leave you alone so he can cap you ?
nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth .
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth ?
who ?
not yu . you !
detective yu ? never met him .
you .
who died ?
carter ?
and you ai n't black !
you would never understand my life . you 're not chinese .
really ? when 's the last time you had some mu-shu let 's hear it , lee , when was it ? year of the rat ?
i have plenty of dates .
you 're pathetic , man . when 's the last time you had some fun ? when 's the last time you took a night off , had a date ?
it 's my job !
my bullshit ? i 'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters ! i 'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords !
stop ! i 'm sick of your bullshit !
why you mad at me ? you needed back-up , so i backed you up . i was about to take out ricky tan and those bodyguards .
fine . go home . who needs you .
back to heaven on earth . i need my damn passport back . i 'm going home .
where are you going ?
do n't look at my ass !
goddamn you got a small ass .
i 'm calling for back up !
i 'm a dangerous man . you 're not gon na ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat .
this is a very dangerous man .
that 's ricky tan ? he 's four feet tall . i 'll go over with you right now , shake him down .
over there -- that 's ricky tan .
what 's wrong ?
hey ! you do n't break in front of a black man in a buffet line .
well , hurry up .
she said i could pick any girl i want .
what are you doing ?
my friend is on vacation , from america . i want to show him a good time .
how you doin ' ?
hello .
i am a tourist .
just follow my lead and act like a tourist .
carter ... you ready to have some fun ! ?
and that 's how you use the lapd choke hold . now start practicing and do n't make me come back here !
this wo n't take long .
i 'm telling you right now , i 'm tired of this shit . there 's two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner .
no time . there was an explosion at the american embassy today -- two american translators were killed .
you 're sorry . i got somebody 's old chopsticks stuck in my ass , so do n't tell me you 're sorry . just take me home .
i 'm sorry .
you lied to me .
try to land on your feet .
all i wanted was a little mu-shu .
shit . c'mon , get up here and help me out .
you just said you 're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking .
what 'd i say ?
you mean tito . we had toto for dinner last night .
no . you are a civilian . in china , i am michael jackson , and you are toto .
man , are you crazy ? you think that scares me ? i 'm from l.a. we invented gangs . we were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it . we get royalties from other gangs . now gim me your badge and gun and i 'll show you how it 's done .
carter , you do n't understand . these men are fu-cang-long triads . part of the most deadly gang in china .
tread softly ? who taught you how to roost a bar ?
no , we 're here for information , to find out where a man named ricky tan is . we must tread softly and keep our ears open .
damn it , why are you ruining my night ? i 'm just starting to have fun . well fine then , go ahead , pull your badge and do your thing .
i 'm sorry .
i knew you were lying .
this is a gangster bar , we 're here undercover .
are you kidding , they love me . i 'm a star , lee . a god to these people !
carter , get off that stage !
bathroom .
blend in ? i 'm two feet taller than everyone here . where you going ?
i 'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes . they do n't like tourists in here , so try to blend in .
take this . it 's a magnum . you can fold it in half .
no .
just relax and do n't worry about a thing . i 'll hook you up in there . you got condoms ?
you better take one . your breath has been a little funky all day . let me look at you .
no .
that 's what i 'm talking about . a real hong kong night club . you want an altoid ?
carter , would i lie to you ?
do n't be messing with me , lee . i will kick your ass . i 'll hit you so hard you 'll end up in the ming dynasty .
of course not . my superindendent invited us to a club tonight . big party .
not mu-shu . mu-shu . i want to see some women . now stop playing dumb and show me the shu !
mu-shu ? you 're hungry ?
do n't be giving me attitude , lee . i 've been here three days and we have n't done shit . we have n't been to a club , have n't even talked to a girl . i 'm on vacation , and i want some mu-shu .
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits , volume two .
i said that ? which word was `` goat ? ''
you invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat .
all i did was invite them for a drink .
those girls drove off because of you .
did you see the way those girls drove off ? i did you a favor .
that was my cd . do n't you ever touch a chinese man 's cd .
i warned you about playing that shit when i 'm in the car .
fine with me .
stay out of it , carter . you 're going back to l.a .
hey , you , secret service man , what are you --
i do n't know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan , or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you 're off this case . i do n't ever want to see you again , you got that ?
what `` revenge '' is he talking about ?
quite a night , inspector . ricky tan was our only bait , and now he 's gone . you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation .
now you know .
i did n't know which side you were on .
i 'm fine .
are you okay ?
no . but i 'll help you .
i 'm asking for real now -- will you help the secret service ?
dip me !
how do i know i can trust you ?
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao , but the place burned down before we could move in .
if i 'm wrong then my cover is blown .
why do n't you go get them ?
behind me is the soft count room . we 're pretty sure the plates are back there .
look over there . that 's the eye in the sky room .
just trying to make it look real .
you move well .
i 'm undercover . i had no choice . you have to trust me .
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck .
i need your help .
what 's going on ?
excuse me ?
put your arms around me .
yes . they 've printed and shipped one hundred million dollars , and there 's only one way to spot a fake .
and hu li killed him for the plates .
it was n't hard to spot the fakes until this past year . then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills .
no . it 's a sample . you guys ever heard of the superbill ?
is this a payoff ?
then you know i 'm not walking away from this case .
i know who you are , inspector lee .
i still have my lunch money from third grade .
do you still have the bills ?
that 's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking . never shut up .
baby duck ?
what are you doing hanging out with baby duck ?
no . freddy ching 's , in crenshaw .
the praying mantis school , in bejing ?
master ching taught me .
i 'll take him .
escort detective carter to the airport --
thank you .
let him find out on his own . i want the hong kong police handling this .
did you tell sterling ?
lee , we just got a call from the harbor patrol . ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight . victoria harbor . if you do n't want to ...
are you okay , lee ?
all he wanted was some mu-shu .
the secret service ? why ?
lee , this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service .
it 's my responsibility .
we think it 's ricky tan . if you do n't want to take the case , i 'll understand .
any leads ?
lee , there was a bombing at the american embassy . two american translators were killed .
do n't you remember ? i 'm already dead .
if you reach for that gun , i 'm going to kill you .
i do n't think it 's over . there are casinos all over this country . let me make you a rich man , lee . do n't make the same mistake he did .
put the plates down . it 's over .
you 're just like your father , lee . all these years hiding behind his badge . i wanted to help him , to share with him , but he was too afraid of change . when you think about it , i did n't really kill him . i just put him out of his misery .
there is a ship , in the hong kong harbor ...
tell me why they killed the customs agents .
nobody can protect me . i 'll make a deal with you , lee . but only iff you 'll get me out of hong kong .
the police can protect you .
... if your father were alive , i would be turning to him now . i did n't blow up the american embassy , but i believe some of my people did . my enemies are trying to frame me . there is a war going on within the triads -- and i am going to lose . my name has been written into the book of death .
do n't .
despite what people suspect ... what you suspect --
you must come with me for questioning .
lee , i 've missed you , brother . i heard about the two americans , i 'm so sorry , you must be under great pressure .
it 's a massage parlor downtown . `` heaven on earth . '' you will find your answers there .
heaven on earth ? master , i do n't understand . a temple , where heaven is on earth ? a mountain , where earth reaches for the --
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth .
i know , master , but ...
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven .
no . your father . your father and ricky tan were my favorite students ... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
ricky tan ?
he was the best i ever trained , you know .
animals kill only from hunger or fear . the man you seek is lower than a serpent . ... he kills for money .
i need your help , master . i 'm seeking a man who used to train with you . he 's become a killer - the worst kind of animal .
yes , master .
did n't i teach you to always arch your back ?
put a diaper on him , chin . i want to talk to the great inspector lee .
that is ... chief inspector lee . the detective in charge of our investigation .
who the hell is that ?
no . he will report to me . do we understand each other ?
chief inspector lee will brief your people ...
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation .
this is still hong kong .
chin , you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation , to provide us with whatever we need . if you have information , it belongs to us .
the ambassador will receive instructions for the drop , half an hour before it is to be made . if it is successful , there will be more . thank you , agent carter .
ok. say what it is .
shut up !
hey , that 's whacked ! i thought we was gettin ' on here !
carter . i just want to be able to tell the ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much .
that 's cool . we 're gettin ' to know each other . this is a good thing . i 'm carter .
what is your name ?
that 's some serious poundage in dollars .
in used currency . nothing bigger than a fifty .
fifty million ! are we talkin ' united states dollars ?
the first drop will be made tomorrow . at twelve o'clock . the amount will be fifty million .
lee ! it 's him !
the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity . if you want the ambassador 's daughter back alive , listen and do not talk .
you know what a phone booth is ? !
do i look like i 'm movin ' ? ! what you 're seeing here ? this is not movement . this is my `` still '' .
you do n't move , you understand ? ! you do n't move !
do n't push it . you better watch your ass with these fed types . if there 's a screw-up , they wo n't think twice about burnin ' it .
and that , of course , would be me .
they asked for the best street man i had .
feds asked for me ?
i got a call from the f.b.i . the daughter of the chinese ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help . you 're it .
hey , sir , it was a pleasure to preserve johnson 's ass . well ... you know what i mean .
good job .
that 's probably the only reason johnson 's still alive .
i know , but --
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy .
sir , i can explain .
i do n't know what went wrong last night , but this department could 've lost one detective and our only explosives expert .
so was i .
he was just doing his job .
tell me about it .
he 'll be ok. russ is a tough son of a bitch .
i 'm gon na arrest the sonuvabitch ! your ass is goin ' to jail !
this is pathetic .
he stole my wheel !
carter .
ooo , there 's a chill . love that .
oh , i think you like this very much .
no shark fin , no camel hump . what you listenin ' to ?
it 's hong kong , not tokyo . my country asked for the best . i told them that was you . now i will show you around my hood .
fbi calls up my ass , says they need help in tokyo . like i 'm supposed to drop everything .
what a surprise !
you know him ?
oh my god . griffin .
hey , do n't worry . nothing 's gon na happen to it .
no , it is china , my country , my history . if any of it gets damaged ...
the art .
what ?
oh no .
well , i ai n't goin ' to china . and neither are you .
what are you doing here ?
be sorry for soon young . she has no chance now .
i 'm sorry , lee .
i 'm sorry .
you drop my gun and you lose my i.d . ?
oh no , i dropped it .
oh yes .
no , wait . i do n't have it . you have it .
it ai n't your ass , it 's my ass you 're backin ' up . take the damn gun .
no , please , i do n't --
i am sorry , but i have too much respect for women .
like that .
no , like a tourist . you know , things to see , money to burn , interested in stupid shit .
i am from outa town .
ok , when you go in , just act like you 're from outa town .
what do you hear ?
this concrete ? this is still america .
this is my territory now . you are my responsibility .
going into the restaurant .
which one ?
it 's him .
what ? !
nobody in america eats fish in the am . we 're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type .
excuse me ?
no , fish is a pm food .
want some ?
i got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours .
are you ok ?
no ! you hate me . look , i 'm gon na do it one time . that 's it .
good god , ya 'll !
not yee-aw , ya 'll . and it 's got ta be angry . like you 're pissed off .
yee-aww .
no , no . it 's not good-god you all ! it 's good-god , ya 'll . ya 'll !
yes , i think so .
that 's not how it goes .
who does not know war ? war , hhh , wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh . what is it good for ? absolutely nothing . good-god , you all .
you know war ?
yes , i know this song .
now , that 's american music .
no , no . i 'm full . too much fin and hump , you know , gives me gas . scuse me .
you want more ?
that one is my favorite . chicken puff with shark fin .
yeah , it 's good .
you like it ?
juntao 's standing orders were to kill everyone . there were never witnesses .
are you tellin ' me nobody knows what he looks like ? come on , there must be witnesses somewhere .
that is a problem . there is no description of juntao . no known photograph .
let 's get us a photo and description . we 'll have an apb out while we stake out the restaurant .
it happens .
thank you . i learn a great deal .
you see what i 'm sayin ' ? you control the space .
took off . yes . they took off .
let 's go . everybody take off ?
come on !
you talk too fast .
yeah , somethin ' like that . ok , now this is a nasty ass place . when you go into a place like this , the most important thing is control . you got to maintain control . you following me ? you lose it , you get hurt . now , you 're my responsibility and i do n't want you hurt . you understand ? ok , let 's go .
stool pigeon .
what ?
stooly .
when we go inside , you let me handle everything , you hear ? this is my man , you dig ? my informant . you know what an informant is ?
yes . he was part of the juntao crime family . he may be juntao himself . and he dropped this .
alright , listen , no bullshit just tell me straight : did you really know the guy you were chasin ' ?
hey , everybody fits in here . look at l.a. , man . nobody 's from here . my momma 's from detroit , my dad 's from atlanta , they met in texas , got married in vegas and i was born in alabama . so where the hell am i from ? kenya ?
i also did not come because i think i would not fit in america .
hey , stop . we 're just gon na wind up in some bar , drinking ' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you 'll start singin ' beach boy songs again . then i 'll really get depressed .
i could not come . i had other responsibilities .
do n't go there ...
i worked with ambassador han and his family for ten years . he wanted me to come with them to america . if i had , this might not have happened .
no . i just made it up .
what is that , some kind of chinese proverb ?
when a man steps in dung , it is obvious . there is no need to rub it in his face . the smell is the same .
bullshit ! you were trying ' to lose my ass again .
it was a man i was after in hong kong .
yeah , sure , you got lots a enemies in l.a. after what ? six hours ?
he was trying to kill me , not you .
it was my ass that almost got trashed !
did you make the plate ? !
what the hell kinda cop are you ? !
no .
the license ! you get it ? !
what plate ?
you make the plate ?
you do n't know what a shortcut is ?
shortcut ?
i know a shortcut .
what about them ?
let me just clarify a few things . i do n't care what kind of cop you are in china , you have no jurisdiction in america . without me you are just another tourist .
mr. carter , i appreciate your desire to show me a good time , but that is not the reason i am here .
right ... .
it was not my intent --
you 're a regular god damn acrobat , are n't you ? bet you feel real good makin ' me look like an asshole .
oh yeah , but this is on the way . and you got ta see john wayne 's footprints . everybody does . it 's almost like a law . you ca n't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big . tiny god damn feet !
i thought you were taking me to the consulate .
wait . you hungry ? you got ta be hungry , you just flew in from china . and what 'd they feed you , chinese food , right ? then you got ta be hungry . hell , it does n't matter , i 'm hungry . we 'll get some food on the way to the consulate .
witnesses .
where were we ?
well do n't do that . polite do n't work here . you do that polite shit here in america , they 'll sue your ass for harassment .
i was being polite .
that silly-ass look on your face .
what ?
-- what the hell is that ?
look , you want to work in this country , you got ta know this crap . okay ? we 're gon na be in some deep shit here . working the danger zone . and you need insurance . cause , you know , you might be starting some riots and shit .
i am afraid i do n't understand the importance of this information .
yeah , that 's right . now that we understand each other ... show me how you did that .
we are both full of shit .
okay , fine , you 're full a shit , i 'm full a shit .
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking . you seemed as if you liked to talk . i like to let people talk who like to talk . it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are .
you 're full of shit . do you understand what i 'm saying to you ? full of shit ?
i am not responsible for your assumptions .
it 's the same thing !
i did n't say i did n't . you assumed i did n't .
bullshit a little . you lied to me .
a little .
you speak english !
yeah , well you 're in american now . everybody 's got guns . that tricky shit with your hands is gon na get your ass shot to hell .
no .
you have one of these ?
let me give you a piece of advice : never touch another man 's radio . you do it again , nobody , not rhonda , not yolanda , gon na save your ass .
help me rhonda .
beach boy america . help me rhonda , help me get her out of my --
you 're shittin ' me . you know the beach boys ? !
beach boy .
okay , i 'll slow down . so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions ... you know , like what 's your name ? how old are you ? you ever expose yourself in public ... shit like that .
you talk very fast .
absolutely . i 'll even let you ride in the front seat .
how about a lift home ?
not to me . never to me .
look at me ! my dress is ruined . i look like shit .
yeah . so why you look do down ?
we saved the girl and got the bad guys , did n't we ?
you ok ?
it 's okay . for restaurants .
you do n't like it ?
that 's it ! you can attack me , but when you attack my car , i can not forgive ! you in the back , girl !
yeah , if you 're superfly .
what ? ! this is a class ride , johnson .
wait a minute . i 'm not riding in that .
it 's called you 're gon na kill me . what 're you doin ' with that on ?
it 's called a dress .
oh my god ... what happened to you ?
alright , johnson , thank you . so ... what are you wearing ?
this is my city . i 'm a cop . i 'll find em .
this whole thing is goin ' down tonight . i need to know where the ambassador is gon na be . the feds will be keepin ' a lid on everything . you thing you can do that ?
jesus ... what do you want ?
listen , this ai n't about us ! it 's about a thirteen year old girl . she 's not gon na make it . unless we do something .
you made a fool out of me ! in front of the fbi !
yes i do . that 's all i got . guts and you , johnson . there 's no one else i can trust .
you got a lot of guts calling me .
no way in the way ! i 'm talkin ' back up , johnson . i 'm in charge ! and i need you , baby .
well.. i would n't want to be in the way .
ok. well ... make us proud . and be careful .
oh baby , do n't worry , i 'll call you . you can count on it .
well ... listen , if you need any help , you know , back up , call me , ok ?
in charge . just me'n him . no interference . they do n't even want to hear from us until we 're done . i love the f.b.i . i love the f.b.i .
they put you in charge ?
oh , you 're not gon na believe what they put me in charge of . they sent for the ambassador 's personal chinese investigator type . he is like the baddest asian shield they got . and i , let me repeat that , i am the man who is on the case with him . just the two of us , alone , workin ' the whole deal as a team .
with the fbi . what do you think i 'm talking about ?
how 'd what go ?
i would n't be close to you . what is that perfume , girl ?
what 's wrong with that ?
i could get promoted right out of here .
no ... what ?
way he put it , i was the only one he thought could handle it . but you know what the worst thing is ?
fbi needs a taste of the street . and i 'm it .
the feds ? !
hey , baby , it 's cool . captain just reassigned me to the feds .
hey , i was senior . it 's ok. this is why i get the big bucks .
last night 's as much my fault as yours . if he 's gon na put the blame on anybody --
oh , baby , you cruel ...
carter , just because you saved my butt , does n't mean it 's yours .
you 're killin ' me here .
where 'd you get it ?
not anymore .
good . that 's standard military packaging for plastique . get a look under it .
yeah ... beautiful . what would you call that paper there ? kind of a ... robin egg blue color ?
and your buddy , mr. lee , is on his way back to china . now , get out . before i file obstruction of justice charges against you .
what ? !
i 'm not interested , carter . you 're no longer on this assignment .
okay , let me start from the top . a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine . now , after the shit blew up last night ...
no , sir . i 'm as good as it gets .
why do n't you try the assignment . or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it ?
oh yeah . the caller was a man . confident . had an accent . my guess , asian . anything else i can do for the fbi , sir ?
eleven thirty tomorrow the ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is . he said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity .
do n't play bullshit games with me .
hmmmm ?
that 's what you were supposed to be !
hey , man , you can use her . she 's an expert !
you think this is funny , carter ? you send for someone from explosives ! ? four men just died in there !
yo , johnson ...
carter , shut up !
you understand what i 'm sayin ' ?
try a bus load of - no , make that two bus loads of chinese --
what do you mean you lost him ? ! how could you lose him ? !
just make him think you 're following leads . interview some suspects , look at fingerprints , do detective shit . i do n't care . i just do n't want to see him- or you , for that matter- until this is resolved . now , we want to make a good impression , do n't we ? his plane lands in an hour . do n't be late .
what the hell am i supposed to do with him ? take him to the zoo ?
because with your special talents , i 'm sure you 'll do a better job .
why do n't you assign one of your own men to this ?
bottom line : i do n't want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident .
what kind of assignment is that ?
do n't worry about the kidnapping , carter , the f.b.i . will handle that . your assignment is lee .
i 'm talking about the girl .
he is the situation .
sir , he 's just gon na get in my way . if i 'm gon na handle this situation ...
... the director considers this top priority , considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances . his name is lee . and he is to be shown every courtesy . within reason .
interrogation is one a my specialties , but undercover work is my forte .
you come highly recommended , carter . and your particular assignment requires a special talent .
how much they want ?
at this point we do n't have much .
any demands yet ?
you do n't . he finds you . through his people .
where do we find him ?
i 'm waitin ' here for a name .
you sonuvabitch .
all i got ta do is implicate . the feds can do a lot with a good implication . even if you do n't get sparky , i 'll bet you get ten to twenty more . plenty of time to find a nice fella .
how did i do this ? ! maybe you did n't notice but i 'm in jail !
you 're movin ' to death row . see , your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents . and when i turn this into the lab , they 're gon na find lafontaine all over it . and we already know ... ... this is your mo .
what are you talking about ?
you got a boy friend in here yet ? cause you 're gon na need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye .
do it !
okay , look , we 're gon na make a trade . you cross the street , leave her on the sidewalk . i will leave him on this side . then we trade places . you get him , i get her . get the picture , lois ?
i would n't touch that if i were you .
what 's this little green wire coming out one side of the package ?
what are you talking about ?
you know something ? every time i see this stuff , it reminds me of ... uh ... a double latte grande ... with two shots of non-fat milk .
shit , i ai n't interested in puttin ' my hands on you . that does nothin ' for me . no . i do n't need to be pattin ' no ass . all i 'm sayin ' is , how do i know you 're not a cop ?
nobody touches me .
i oughta pat your ass down . make sure you 're not a cop .
i do n't trust anybody . especially first time deals .
this is not a good way to start a relationship , stickin ' a gun to a man 's head , feelin ' around his personal equipment . make him think you do n't trust him .
or somethin ' .
you a cop or something ?
shut up !
hey , hey , you start touching me there , i 'm gon na start movin ' ! word up , mother ...
i want to speak with my daughter !
take the money with you tonight . pack it in six dragons . you will be contacted again .
hello .
please , you must understand , what happened today was not --
you have run out of time . the amount now is two hundred million . i will call later with instructions . you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter .
yes .
can i speak with her ?
she 's fine .
my daughter .
even if you deny the fbi is there , i will assume you are lying .
yes .
ambassador han .
hello .
pack it into black garbage bags . throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the fang shan restaurant in china town . you have twenty-nine minutes left .
i do .
you have what i asked for ?
yes .
griffin ? where are you .
it 's griffin .
yes .
han ?
hello .
do n't worry , he 's with carter .
and mr. lee ? where is he ?
yes sir , me too . the state department has authorized release of the funds . we 'll have to make the first drop at 7. as soon as they pick up the money , we 've got em .
i am so sorry about your men .
carter , can i have a moment ?
come on . let 's get you some dry clothes .
he is already on the plane . i hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me .
i understand , sir . but you are an honored guest of the united states ...
i am not an american , mr. russ . my daughter is not an american .
as i said , sir , we 've got all the people we need .
he is very good .
ambassador , let me assure you that the fbi has made this a top priority . we have plenty of manpower on the case .
i would like one of my people to help .
soon young , do n't worry . you will have many friends very soon . you will see . america is a very friendly place .
i will not have friends in america .
after i left ?
i was trying to find the right time .
i do n't believe you . my father was explaining to mr. griffin . that is how i found out .
i still have work to do here .
when were you going to tell me you were not going with us ?
let me take you back inside , okay ?
yes .
i lead maggie through a visualization exercise . all the sports shrinks use this head stuff . visualize the end zone , if you catch my drift .
right .
i 've got news for you . no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic .
so if you 're not running and ike graham is there to see it , then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending , right ? all we 're doing is turning lemon into lemonade .
i 'm not running .
let him come to the wedding . you 're not running , right ? say it . `` i 'm not ... ''
you do n't understand this guy .
sure i do . but the bet defense is a good offense , right ? you 're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game .
at the wedding ? you invite him ? bob , do n't you realize he 's writing another article about me ?
i 'm just bragging about how great you are . i 'm the luckiest man alive .
bob -- are you making friends with this man ?
ike just came by to check out the team .
what is he up to now ?
maintain eye contact .
got any last minute advice ?
i did n't want to find out i was n't for her in the fourth quarter .
really ?
thank you .
you look awful .
how about -- `` i hope you 'll be very happy together '' ?
what do you expect me to say to this ?
hold it ! hold it ! i think we 're taking this too fast .
at this pace , it could be an evening wedding .
you bet ya , coach .
see you at the wedding .
i 'm the town 's unofficial fitness trainer . big advocate of the mind and body combining for success . you could say or you can quote me , i 'm a glass half full king of guy .
ahh .
of course .
could your confess to father patrick from now on ?
of course .
i 'm happy here , where i 'm supposed to be . but if you ever become a catholic , may i ask you a favor , maggie ?
i 'm really sorry that i hurt you , brian .
weird . like after all those years you would remem --
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs .
god bless you , maggie .
god ... of course . i 'm sorry -- i mean , i 'm ... brian -- i 've got to go . the man 's a lunatic , but i know exactly where he 's going next .
it happens to be how i feel .
good one ! thanks .
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended ?
and what did you say ?
only respectful things . what did we have in common back then ... what kind of music did you like ... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar ...
what did he ask ?
yes , yes , i 'm sure i only did you good , maggie .
what ? you talked to him ! did you tell him we dated before you were a priest ?
actually , he only asked me one ridiculous question . the rest were n't so bad .
he 's here ! ... he 's here !
i 'll get the dress .
we 'll rub .
it 's hurting .
we do it to our dog .
eight is good ... `` v '' could be victory .
and in a `` v '' .
okay -- have a seat ... gently , carefully .
that 's it . back to obedience school .
yes , rubbing your ears is very soothing . cory does that to me when i hyperventilate .
rub your ears .
his hair ... any color .
i love his eyes . i just believe they 're listening to you .
`` never say die . ''
`` nothing but net . ''
`` make the shot . ''
`` sink the putt . ''
do n't be nervous , maggie . let us visualize . remember what bob said ? `` be the ball . ''
bob 's in a hurry .
bob is making her visualize the ceremony .
tell me , why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding ? she 's already done this .
where do you think she 's going ?
maggie !
i 'm sorry , too . wow . that only took us between years to say .
well -- i 'm sorry , i 'm really sorry , ellie .
no . no , you did n't .
is that what i did to you ? is that what happened ? did i just not see you ?
but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all . each one was convinced that she was perfect for them , but they did n't see her . and she never showed up so they could n't see her . it 's a very symbolic thing happening . she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be .
fisher , let him talk .
i 'm sorry , ike . this is permanent .
see ? you want custody of my job ? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel i 've served my time ?
i already made an appointment for later today .
lawyers . i do n't know , ellie -- firing me is going to be very tough on you . it 's going to be hard to get over . there will be therapy bills for you .
i merely write the stuff . you 're the one that serves it up .
no , that 's what makes you unemployed .
someone reliable , i 'm sure . a booze- hound in a bar ?
i did n't cook up a story . i had a source .
that 's not nothing to do with it . you cooked this story up and you know it .
lesson number two . never work for your former spouse .
journalism lesson number one . if you fabricate your facts , you get fired .
what ?
-- it 's for you , ike .
so ? i never returned your calls , even when we were married . and what 's fisher doing here anyway ?
i left four messages . you do n't return my calls .
fully . i like her . she has wit .
poor ike .
look , he 's in pretty good shape .
look , he 's running after her .
or does she pick `` ngb 's '' -- `` nice guys , but ... '' nice guys , but i 'm cheap . nice guys , but he lives with his mom ... nice guys , but he just out of prison .
or a vegetarian ?
... just call me when you have it . ike , how is the story coming ? is she a man-eater ?
overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout . that 's new york living .
i just found out i 'm best man ! i 'm lucky i have a suit ... what 's wrong ?
your job is ... the ring . do you have the ring ? !
i have no idea what i 'm doing .
go talk to the pastor and he 'll tell you what to do . and someone will tell me what to do .
well , i 'm good , i do n't know if i 'm best .
then you 'll be my best man .
of course we are . of course .
whoa , ike . getting a complex , buddy ?
no ... they 're interesting guys . each one of these guys has something going for him . i mean , one 's been up everest . another 's become a priest . one 's a pretty good guitar player . and this guy today tried to end world hunger , if you can believe that ...
order out like a philistine , when you got the galloping gourmet here ? ...
okay , we 'll order out .
then come for dinner .
yeah .
you 're coming here ?
look -- i 'll be in there later today . i 'll come by and tell you all about it .
i do n't know .
no , i 'm paying for the dress . do you think she 's still gon na run ?
this is about her negative attention , not mine . did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet ?
yes , well , my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention ... negative attention is attention . like when women whack you on the street because of your column , that 's negative attention .
oh yeah ! i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car .
do n't say `` spec '' like it 's a dirty word . nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play ! plato never got a book advance ...
but i 'll get my normal fee , right ?
justice , yes . paid , i do n't know . they like the idea , but my hands are tied with budget restraints .
`` paid vindication '' that 's what i call justice .
then you 've got it . if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands , you 'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot .
okay , you were right . i hated my column , but i can do this assignment .
if she runs , then it 's a cover story . all true . all accurate .
this is good . it is a good story , fish .
it would n't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again .
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland .
all the gory details .
the real story on miss carpenter .
vindication . how would you like to get some ? a chance to prove that , though your facts were n't entirely straight , your theory was correct .
what are you trying to say to me , fish ?
ike , i really liked the runaway bride piece , and since i do freelance stuff for g.q. , i 'm in a different position now ...
do n't knock drunk guys in bars . drunk guys in bars are good . it means they 're not driving .
in vino veritas .
since when does ellie need moral supp --
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support .
oh , please !
unbelievable , she got to you .
no . i call it like i see it . i 'm a journalist . i 'm a truth teller .
and you defending her ?
i do n't know . i 'm working on it . i was on the wrong track .
why do you think she ran ?
i do n't think that 's why she ran .
same as you said . what did you call her ? a `` man-eater '' , `` a devouring death goddess . ''
neuter a locust , feed the world .
not bad . i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me .
guess you 'd know about that . you 're an entomologist , right ? how 's business ?
ah , ca n't stay away from her , can you ? like a moth to a flame .
well , i 'm writing another article on the cacophony .
she 's a cacophony of contradictions .
thanks .
and end up in the papers ? i 've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime , thank you . i 'm sorry she got you canned .
you could have told me you were fiance number three .
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter , very professional job .
get this man a kamikaze .
no , i 'm not .
it 's okay . there 's no microphone . you 're no fun .
tootaloo .
well , i 'm off . a reporter 's work is never done . mrs. pressman , thank you .
oh , i will .
good fact . well , you let me know .
i 'm not sure . mr. schullian runs the newsstand , he 's our local bookie , you know , he 's giving eight to one odds she wo n't . he says she 's so famous now , maybe vegas will give odds on her . i 'm going to wait to hear what the pros say .
i know . tell me something . do you think she 's going to make it all the way this time ?
it 's her fourth time to the altar , you know . not seven like they said .
yes , mrs. pressman .
excuse me , sir . i have an actual fact for you .
sorry , no . i just got one .
oh , sure . that was a long time ago . see , she 's not a man-hater at all . she 's very supportive of men ...
it 's nice that they 're still friends .
that must have made you proud .
this game is pretty important to him . he made all-stars in high school , you know .
not yet . i had a phlemless morning . i hear he 's a pretty good ballplayer .
have you listened to his morning show , `` wake up with ballplayer '' ?
no , she 's talking about your hair .
i think you 'd look good in red .
yep . maggie -- someone to see you .
looking for maggie .
and you are ?
peggy phleming . not the ice skater .
i am just such a reporter . and you are ?
no , about her getting that asshole from new york fired .
about her upcoming wedding and all .
it 's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie .
what ?
are you a reporter ?
hello . i 'm looking for maggie carpenter . there was a sign at the hardware store across the street ...
oh , come on . you 're practically family .
thank you .
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car -- a '63 buick .
bye , betty . thanks .
your two cinnamon rolls .
-- the luau for maggie .
oh , betty . i take it you 're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you 're throwing --
betty trout . five dollars .
yes , i am . and who are you ?
got ta tell you this about my daughter . my daughter makes real good time , even in a long dress and heels . maggie may not be hale 's longest running joke , but she certainly is the fastest .
dad 's fishing trip , grandma 's knee operation , grandma 's birthday ...
ah , beautiful . i just ca n't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that .
like her mother .
you know , your daughter seems ...
well , wedding cake freezes . this we know .
gee , i hope they do n't have a fight out there . you do n't think they 'll call it off ... ?
oh , yeah . scared the hell out of skipper .
they made me put my hat back on .
i borrowed it from this guy i know . so ?
pretty good speech , maggie .
`` i guarantee that we 'll have tough times . i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out . but i also guarantee that if i do n't ask you to be mine , i 'll regret it for the rest of my life . because i know in my heart -- you 're the only one for me '' .
i 'm listening .
i was , because if you said `` yes '' right away , i would n't get to say this next part . and i 've been practicing it . ready ?
you were not .
this is getting serious .
they 're mine . i 'm turning in my running shoes to you .
used ?
i did n't . and you being the one at the end of the aisle did n't just fix that .
yes , i did .
i think so ... when i was walking down the aisle ? i was walking toward somebody who did n't have any idea who i really was . and it was only half the other person 's fault , because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted . so it was good that i did n't go through with it because it would have been a lie , but you -- you knew the real me .
does it matter ?
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things .
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career . so , what are you doing here ?
it 's something i 've always wanted to do .
livid is good . so what is it , maggie ? you here on business ? i saw your lamps . they 're terrific .
i do n't have much choice in the matter now , do i ? but i ca n't speak for italics . traitor !
i 've been making friends with your cat . is it okay that i 'm here ?
so , we 'll ...
so am i .
i 'm okay with that .
and the wedding date . there 's the two of us . so , you think ... maybe ... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back .
and the church .
well , you do have the dress .
yes , you !
me ?
to who ? are you asking me ?
i love you , too .
i love you . i love you .
me , either .
i do n't know . i , uh -- i frankly do n't even want to talk about it .
okay . so ... what , uh ... what just happened ? just now ? jus then ? in there ?
really ?
a little longer for me .
about a minute ... ?
i kissed him back .
i 'm sorry , bob . she kissed me back .
come on , it 'll give you a great view . it 's perfect . hey .
i 'd rather not .
no . no -- actually , let 's make ike the pastor .
no you do n't . you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet . you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem . you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he 's burning to talk to you and he ca n't wait another minute to find out what you 'll say . am i right ?
yes i do !
no , that 's called not having a mind of your own . what are you doing , maggie ? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon ? you do n't want to climb annapuma .
that 's called changing your mind .
with the priest , you liked them scrambled . with the dead head , fried . with the bug guy , poached . now it 's egg whites only , thank you very much .
what ! ?
that 's right . you 're so lost you do n't even know how you like your eggs .
lost !
supportive ? you were n't being supportive . you were being scared . just like now . you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on .
every one of those times i was being supportive . something you wo n't understand .
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress .
brian told you that ?
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai ?
i already explained about that .
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo ?
that was very interesting research george was doing !
or the sexual habits of locusts ?
it 's fun ! it 's high .
well , they should . because they 're about to watch you hang yourself again .
i had it under control . now they feel sorry for me .
no , maggie , i defended you . humiliating you is what everyone else is doing . it 's the theme of this party .
you humiliated me !
i 'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you .
i do n't and i do n't think you should ...
yes .
are you all right with this ? you think this is funny ?
excuse me ?
i do n't know , give me a minute . are you all right with this ?
missed me bad , huh ?
where did you disappear to ?
yes it is . and it does n't mean anything .
no . but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness . attraction is very misleading . and if it 's mutual , it 's well , terribly distracting .
yeah . it 's kind of nice .
kind of isolated .
wrenches . my dad 's gon na love that one .
of what ?
first i have to find some tools . i need a half and a nine-six-tenth .
can you fix it ?
your filter 's clogged . this takes unleaded .
why do n't you let him sleep it off in the trunk . i 'll take you for a ride . then we 'll come back for him . keep an eye on him .
watch your leg , dad . i 'm so tired of this .
no -- i 'm cleaning an attic . i would n't attempt the impossible .
hmmm ... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album . you 're not trying to soften me up , are you ?
no . you take it .
it 's valuable . hang onto it .
it was in the attic . it was jus sitting there gathering dust .
oh , my god -- it 's miles davis . this is `` king of blue '' ! this is the original recording . hard to find in good condition . where did you find this ?
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss .
ike ... hi , grandma .
you know , there 's no ...
tell me . when you get to the altar , will you spike the bouquet ?
what was that ? i ca n't order my eggs without sarcasm ?
of course .
i 'll have the same .
bob will be very happy .
fine . the newspaper 's upside down . that 's better than fine .
you look ... uh ... you look fine .
agreed .
even with everything that 's happened i 've still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress .
maybe you should ask her some time . ever thought of that ?
no .
you do n't know .
i do n't know .
now that 's romantic . a proposal like that and you did n't find eternal bliss ? what went wrong ?
no . i think i said something eloquent like , `` so , uh -- maybe we should , ya know . what do you think ? ''
so ? is that what you said to her ?
i 'm a work in progress .
maybe it 's just me , but -- if you got to dress it up , it does n't ring true .
what do you mean ? it was incredibly romantic !
highly suspect .
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life . cal ripken even applauded .
he 's an entomologist ! i thought it was very unique .
it 's a little `` silence of the lambs '' for me . i ca n't believe you waited for the wedding to run .
still sweet .
always a mood killer .
what an incredible chauvinistic observation .
well , i 'm impressed . absolutely incredible . i did n't expect pink and lacy , but this is n't exactly a woman 's room .
no , i 'm not afraid . just ... maybe someday .
you afraid to try ?
maybe someday .
i like it . this whole thing is pretty incredible . i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york .
i think so .
cindy the manicurist .
it 's a birthday present for my cousin . put your finger in .
done .
six-fifty .
five hundred .
seven-fifty .
too much .
because i think you 're writing on spec and with a first person interview , you might actually sell that thing .
you 've seen the post-its . i 've already got more juicy material than i need . why should i pay you dollar one ?
oh , but making up the facts as you go along is ethical ? actually , i meant you . you probably got severance or expenses or both . i 'll take your check . no credit cards .
my magazine does n't pay because for stories . it 's not what you call ethical .
really .
my point is that one again , you 're getting it all wrong . that wo n't improve your reputation any , and it 's not very flattering to me either . so , i 'm going to give you a chance to write the truth .
i 'm not a boastful man . what 's your point ?
you 're welcome . your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction . your observations are distorted , ungrounded an incomplete . you must be very proud .
how do i do it ? i 'm not that beautiful .
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers .
obviously , i 'm not the only one who does n't understand it . the uss maggie leaves quite a wake ... excuse me .
you misinterpret everything . we 've all been friends our whole lives . but that 's the types of relationship you would n't understand .
you can turn that finger around .
you 've been here for three minutes . what did you do to her ?
he is not !
look , look , man . i think the man is heartbroken .
but the most interesting thing here is that i do n't see the rose tattoo that i 've heard about on your back .
give me that !
a pre-wedding luau ?
grandma made me the cutest outfit . i ca n't wait to show it to you .
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak .
we think so .
how romantic .
without oxygen ...
really ?
twice ...
everest . is that right ?
despite what you think , i do n't do it on purpose . and i have no intention of doing it again .
that 's fair .
i 'd love to stay and chat , but i 've got to get back to work . i still have my job .
we 'll see .
you 're going to be very disappointed .
yes . conviction . conviction that i 'm onto the truth . you 're going to do the same thing to `` poor bastard number four '' that you did to the last three . you 're going to run again . and i 'm not leaving until you do .
did something happen to make you care about reality ?
you have one ?
i 'm not here to make you feel bad . i 'm here for vindication . in my heart ...
yes .
weird dreams ? you 're going to tell me about them ?
nervous ? not at all ! no . i 've never been more certain in my life . except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams .
getting nervous ?
you 'll answer my questions ?
well , instead of a haircut , how about a wash ? you know , get all that city grit out of it .
excellent .
originality is my speciality .
i hope you have a different angle . it 's pretty much all been covered .
quick . very quick .
thank you . you still think that he was ... .
wedding . wedding . you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row .
what are you talking about ?
okay .
no , i 'm just going to head home .
want to go to butch 's for a drink or something ?
i 'm just finishing up , too .
you okay ? i 'm closing .
no sauntering down the aisle . just make time . let 's just get there .
let 's go .
not eight ...
you and your lucky geese . you always see geese .
no , no . i saw eight geese flying in a `` v '' .
he 's not coming . watch . he 's not coming .
see , this is a mature relationship . she 's really found it .
grandma !
it 's for the bell .
... i do n't even want to talk about the luau . what 's this ?
what happened at the luau ?
yep . i want him to be front and center and to watch everything .
he 's going to be the pastor ?
would it ?
i have n't seen him in twenty-four hours . it just gives me the creeps a little bit . i 'd feel better if i knew where he was .
this party is for you and bob . get your mind off the reporter .
lighten up , what ?
lighten up , wahine .
thanks . will you fix my hair ?
you 're right . it 's not funny now . maybe we both grew up .
it 's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt . it 's not anymore .
something that brings warmth to my heart . duckbill platypus .
i think you 're right . is there anything i can do to make it up to you ?
i 'm not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you 're irreversibly screwed up . but , maggie , you 've been like this since we were kids . and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people 's feelings , maybe it 's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own , like bob , if he 's the one .
peggy , there 's distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up . despite that , i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory , and i beg your forgiveness .
no . you 're quirky . quirky and weird are two different things .
but i 'm weird .
no . i 'm weird . weird and mysterious are two different things .
but you have n't lost your mystery ! you 're very mysterious !
no , i do n't think you 're like , `` i 'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do n't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you '' . very hard to compete with . especially to us married women who have lost our mystery .
because you think i 'm all like ... `` hey man , check me out '' .
why ?
i 'm going to kill myself .
on anything male that moves ? as opposed to anything male that does n't move ?
i know . i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves .
yes .
thank you . do you think i flirt with cory ?
good morning to you , too . you look good .
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair . he 's an attractive man .
over there . ten o'clock . he 's talking to our little dennis . dennis will turn into one of those `` sources say '' things .
where ?
there he is . snoop doggy-dogg .
not that he does n't deserve to get fired ... look ! cory 's going for second ! ... sneaky !
ya think ?
it 's probably because you got him fired .
that 's what he says , but if he thinks that i do n't realize he 's writing another article , then he 's an idiot .
for what reason ? some personal satisfaction ?
okay , he 's on base . can we talk about my life now ? -- ike 's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill , blah blah . he 's totally out to get me .
she 's the boss .
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they 're getting haircut .
yup !
reporter ?
stop it . when you talk like that , i get turned on and it frightens me .
i did n't even need to change this gasket , just put in a little hydraulic fluid .
you 're a goddess !
yes , i 've seen it . and i have to say it 's the rudest and most offensive ... joke anybody 's ever played on me !
so -- mag -- you 've seen this , huh ?
no , it 's humiliating and you 've been doing it since i was a kid . i do n't like it . stop . you may not like having a daughter with problems . but guess what ? i do n't like having a father who 's drunk all the time . i 'll eat in my room .
a harmless joke .
no . it 's my life .
maggie , it 's just a joke ...
just stop it . do n't say another word like that .
what ?
thank you , dad .
i 'm really rooting for this one .
i changed it . see you later , mr. travis . that guy has a problem ... maggie , you can run everyone 's life but your own .
his name is skipper , dad ... steady .
good boy , port hole .
i 'm not exactly having fun , either ... steady .
not this one . this one 's on me .
so i 've come to see it as a bonus , really , that we 've been able to plan , and pay for , so many weddings .
maybe she has n't read the paper ...
yeah .
you know , it 's just possible that she has n't read this yet .
no .
no , no . you 're her best friend .
no , you tell her .
you tell maggie .
`` and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance . so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride is n't honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race ... before the rice hits the ground '' holy moly .
`` what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them . she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar. '' ... i ca n't ready anymore .
so you 're angry . big deal .
you turn it on , you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time .
what am i going to do with a microwave ?
you take the microwave ?
that 's good .
how about ... you 're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way .
nope .
you do n't love me , is that it ?
nope .
is there somebody else ?
there 's no why , annie . i 'm just not up for it . i never said i was .
no , that 's free . he 's an architect . used to do big high-profile projects . he scaled it all back when his wife died . now he remodels people 's homes . he works in a small firm , makes a good living .
i hope i do n't have to pay for that piece of information .
it 's on the lake right in the middle of seattle . it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
but it 's on the water .
it 's not a boat boat . it 's really a house .
boats . all anyone talks about is the wind . is it up , is it down . i ca n't live with a man who only talks about the wind .
houseboats do n't go anywhere .
boats . you go out in them . you come back in them . i hate them .
it sounds nice .
i hate boats .
he 's got a houseboat .
tell me he 's living in squalor . tell me everything he has is being repossessed , including his filthy , dented mobile home .
look !
what ?
oh !
yes . some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony .
you okay ?
i think that 's what i 'm saying .
oh , walter . i do n't deserve you .
not really . look , annie , i love you . let 's leave that out of it . i do n't want to be someone you 're settling for . i do n't want to be someone anyone settles for . i have a life insurance policy , i 'm fully invested in growth stocks , i have a paid subscription to home rox office , i have no sexual diseases , i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that is n't soft , i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth , i dress nicely , i am a member of the private sector , an independent voter , i do n't watch monday night football , the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat , strawberries , penicillin , pollen , nuts and wool . there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring . if you do n't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it , is n't it ?
i 'm not at the top of the empire state building . i 'm here .
at the top of the empire state building --
i told you . nothing --
so what happened ?
yes . but it was n't really . it was just ...
-- it was a betrayal .
i do n't know what to say about it , walter . it was a form of temporary insanity . but i had to tell you about it because --
walter , there 's something i have to tell you --
beautiful view , is n't it ?
it 's so beautiful . it 's just what i would have picked out if i 'd had every ring in the world to choose from . you see what i mean . there are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises , but i am not one of them . surprises are highly overrated .
it was my mother 's .
walter .
it 's just like my grandmother 's china .
i do .
you could n't .
do n't hate me but i love this pattern .
well , i did . and you know what i think ? i think that it was almost ... too perfect .
no .
about forever .
what ?
i am . i was just ... i just got ... i think i got nervous . it 's normal , right ? do n't you ever feel nervous about , you know ?
ever since christmas , you 've been different . kind of distracted , distant . but i feel like you 're coming back from wherever you were .
you go .
okay , okay .
and then i 'll see you in new york --
when you get back , i 'll be gone --
not for the kind of place i want to do . i wo n't be in chicago that long .
could n't you just do a phone interview ?
i know . it makes no sense at all . thank god my life is in place .
that does n't make any sense .
becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was rick , which meant he was cheating on her . she was completely hysterical . then it turned out the woman lived in duluth .
i got ta go . i 'll see you at work . walter , you scared me . do n't ever do that again .
miss scarlett . in the broom closet . with the radio .
oh , it 's just becky , she 's having trouble with rich again . hold on , becky , i 'm going downstairs .
who is it ?
i do n't think so .
does it have wheat in it ?
it 's delicious , trust me .
what is it ?
we will ? the symphony ? okay . i 'll take you to the russian tea room for pelmeni .
go to the symphony --
go for a walk in central park --
we 'll stay at the plaza --
walter , i 'd love to --
i was thinking , i have to go up to boston for the aap convention and then visit winston-hughes about switching over our computers . why do n't we meet in new york for valentine 's day weekend ?
happy new year .
happy new year , darling .
do n't be silly . i 'll just be ten minutes behind you .
i 'll wait .
how will i get back to baltimore saturday ? oh god , i forgot my present for your stepmother -- i took it inside by accident .
you sure you do n't want to drive with me ?
nope . not even when i was young .
even when you were young ?
nope .
i love you , walter . did anyone ever call you anything other than walter ?
i love you .
they loved you . i told you they would love you and they did .
today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth .
is that all right with you ?
my head swells up like a watermelon and i drop dead .
if he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
he 's allergic to everything , do n't worry about it --
do n't touch them . i feel terrible sneezing at a time like this . this is a big moment for me --
they 're going to love you .
am i what they had in mind ?
i hope he does n't get out his slides .
your uncle milton lost all his money in a puerto rican condominium that went belly up , do n't mention the irs or the federal prison system . your mother is barbara , your father is cliff --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
and your brother tom is a psychology professor and is married to ... betsy --
-- because irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he did n't --
harold , who ran away with his secretary but came back --
-- who 's married to --
the short one with black hair is your cousin irene --
i hate it . i 'm so happy , becky . finally i feel happy . this is right . this is real . everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts . please do n't tell anyone about what happened . `` sleepless in seattle '' is history .
i love the symphony .
we 're going to the rainbow room and the symphony tomorrow night .
what are your plans in new york ?
no , i 'm not .
you 're going to miss the train .
it does n't mean anything . it was written before i went out there . before the ho .
what about the letter ?
i 'm going to run back to walter 's arms , if he 's still have me .
so he ca n't write . big deal . i mean , verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy , and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble .
made for each other .
m.f.e.o . ?
`` dear annie : thanks for your letter . it was great . we 're very excited about meeting you in new york on valentine 's day and seeing if we are m.f.e.o . sleepless in seattle . ''
so i mailed your letter .
becky ?
well , it 's the same woman . and he was crazy about her . what is this ? this is from seattle .
this is a photo of hair .
i saw her . she looked just like this --
you do n't know who she was , annie --
it 's a sign i 've watched this movie too many times . i 'm so stupid . from the minute i listen to that stupid program on the radio , i 've been a complete jerk .
it 's a sign --
he said hello .
but he saw you , right ?
that was nothing compared to this humiliation , nothing .
i love that dream .
you know that dream where you 're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you ?
you were standing in the middle of the street ?
good night .
i love you , too .
thank you . i love you .
no . that 's the weirdest part about it .
is this crazy ?
what ?
becky ?
okay . good . goodbye .
that 's not what i mean . i 'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him . i am .
you told a lie and got on a plane .
i could n't do it . how did i get here ?
did you talk to him ?
definitely .
you 'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it .
i thought i would look into doing a story about those radio shows .
the kid is on . you 've got me listening to this garbage . go on , turn it on .
what ?
turn on your radio !
hello .
i always wondered about that too .
do you think at the end of the movie when she 's in the wheelchair they can still do it ?
i know .
men never get this movie .
listen to this , i love this part --
plus he fell in love with a temp .
and then you left him ? he lost weight there and you left him ?
yes .
no .
can too .
that 's impossible . a guy ca n't --
he lost all the weight ... there .
you never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet .
you want to hear about destiny ? if my husband had n't gone on a diet , which caused me to leave him , i would never have been on that flight to miami , and met rick , and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says `` vacant-occupied , vacant- occupied , vacant-occupied '' --
good . perfect . i 'll be in new york with walter , i can squeeze it in .
`` on top of the empire state building at sunset on valentine 's day . ''
`` i want to meet you ... ''
your destiny can be your doom . look at me and rick .
i do n't know . i mean , what if i never meet him ? what if this man is my destiny and i never meet him ?
what ?
i should say something in this about magic .
right .
i 'm going to marry walter . i just have to get this out of my system .
you are . you 're losing your mind . what about walter ?
i know that . you think i do n't know that ? `` i know that 's a dumb way to begin , but it 's the only way i can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when i heard the two of you on the radio . on the other hand , maybe i 'm just losing my mind . ''
and this woman is a writer ! that 's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers .
`` i am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows '' --
it sounds like the name of a mattress store --
`` dear sleepless and son ... ''
... movie . that 's your problem . you do n't want to be in love . you want to be in love in a movie . read it to me .
they knew it . time , distance , nothing could separate them . because they knew . it was right . it was real . it was ...
you 're a basket case .
not .
oh ? oh , really ? now we 're getting down to it .
actually , he sounded nice .
and now 2,000 women want his number . the guy could be a crackhead , a psychopath , a flasher , a junkie , a transvestite , a chain-saw murderer , or someone really sick , like rick .
that 's what she called him on the show . because he ca n't sleep .
`` sleepless in seattle '' ?
nothing 's with me .
what 's with you ?
what was what ?
what was that about up there ?
there 's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
it 's not true , but it feels true .
whatever it is .
about what ?
you should write something about this .
you want a tail . i got a guy in seattle --
no . not remotely . i just want to find out about him .
oh . like glenn close in that movie .
i 'll tell you the truth , i heard this guy on a call-in radio show and i might not marry the person i should marry because i 've become obsessed with him .
a sense of humor .
no , no , no , it 's more like , who is he , does he have a sense of humor , is he nice -- no forget nice , i 've got nice --
so you want a financial , is he a deadbeat , we can do a d & b --
no , i know that part --
do you want a matrimonial , past wives , any kids --
she has a pattern of getting involved with losers ... once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus .
okay .
i need to know about him because ... he 's involved with my sister ...
that 's what i 'm going to do . i 'm going to go home . i quit . laurie , i quit . i 'm going back to baltimore . how does a blonde do a high- five ?
go home for the weekend .
i want my money .
maybe you should see a shrink .
i know .
he was n't even wrong for you , like < u > cosmically < /u > wrong , so do n't beat up on yourself for wasting ... however long it was .
i know .
honey , he was n't right for you .
howard .
howard .
hi , jonah . sam . and who is this ?
i 'm jonah . that 's my dad . his name is sam .
yes .
are you annie ?
come on , jonah --
oh god , it 's major . he 's kissing her on the lips . i have to stop this .
how am i going to explain this to walter ?
this is a complete disaster . i wanted him to find a wife , but he 's got the wrong one --
this is a grotesque violation of this man 's personal life , but never mind --
please --
and you crazy ? he thinks shows like this are dumb . if you did n't have an 800 number i could never get away with this --
perfect . sandbag the father .
any time .
thank you , tom . i feel so much better just having blown this off .
yes , i did .
i know , i know . i do not want to move to seattle . but what i really do n't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing i could have done something . what do you think ? it 's just cold feet , is n't it ? everyone panics before they get married , did n't you ?
it rains nine months of the year in seattle .
i do n't even know him . but i 'm having all these fantasies about a man i 've never met , who lives in seattle .
annie , when you meet someone and you 're attracted to them , it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious , subconsciously . so what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match .
but when you met her , did you believe she was the only person for you ? that in some mystical , cosmic way , it was fated ?
i got married because betsy said we had to break up or get married . so we get married .
i mean , why did you get married ? was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
what ?
i think i 'm going crazy , tom . i really do . are you happily married ?
you do n't believe in signs .
it 's a sign .
so you 'll get married in a new dress .
like ... clockwork .
well , fine , fine . fiddle da dee . and how 's it working ?
mom , we already ...
of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department , so do n't be worried if it takes a while --
mom !
i knew we would be together forever , and that everything would be wonderful , just the way you feel about walter . walter . it 's quite a formal name , is n't it ? one of the things i truly knew was that your father and i were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack i believe you call it --
magic .
magic . it was magic .
what ?
you know .
what ?
i was in atlantic city with my family . cliff was a waiter . he talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the steel pier . i 've probably told you this a million times , but i do n't care . and then he held my hand . i was scared . all sorts of thing were going through my head . but after a while i forgot about them . at one point i looked down , at our hands , and i could n't tell which fingers were mine and which were his . and i knew .
it was n't a sign . it was a coincidence .
then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread ? how many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna ?
oh , please . destiny 's just something we 've invented because we ca n't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental .
destiny takes a hand .
it is , is n't it ? you make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life .
how amazing .
it 's silly , really . i mean , i 'd seen him at the office , obviously i 'd seen him , he 's the associate publisher , and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place , and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat , which of course he was allergic to , and i got his lettuce and tomato on white .
how did it happen ?
you 'll love them . we 're going down to d.c. tonight to be with them christmas morning .
are his folks nice ?
i know . he 's wonderful , is n't he ?
i notice these things are back in fashion . oh , honey . he 's a lovely man , annie .
granny 's dress . oh , mom .
the historical society wanted this and i never would give it to them --
we 'll move them --
it 's probably just the flowers --
walter and i are engaged !
everybody ! annie has an announcement --
the one in the street . i chased after you .
it 's me ?
it 's you .
shhhh --
hi . so far so good . so . what should we talk about ? how insecure we were in high school . shirley votypka , the first girl i ever felt up . health . what about health ? did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak ?
hi .
hello .
hello .
magic .
magic .
you touch her for the first time , and suddenly ... you 're home . it 's almost like ...
sure you do --
sure you do .
thanks , but i 'll pass . it 's kind of a big night . i do n't like to leave jonah alone .
sam , if you 're not doing anything new year 's -- obviously you 're not doing anything new year 's -- we 're having some people over , all of them married , not one even remotely interested in playing around . does that sound great or what ? i ca n't think of the last time i was at a party when anything actually happened .
why me ? what about jay ?
the point is , take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we wo n't have to redo the kitchen cabinets .
grace the dispatcher . great .
grace heard it .
great . this is great . the whole town knows . just out of curiosity , how do you two know ?
the cabinets have to be redone --
which means --
and if i could describe it , it probably would n't be on a radio show . but what the hell . it 's not one specific thing . it 's more of a feeling .
why not ?
i do n't think i could really describe it .
what was it that made you know ?
i do n't know . when i met my wife , it was so clear . i just < u > knew < /u > .
what are you going to do , sam ?
it 's hard to imagine .
do you think there 's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife ? maybe even more ?
what 's she talking about ?
we 've been talking to -- well , let 's just call him sleepless in seattle , and we 'll be right back after this break with listener response , < u > your < /u > response , to the things we 've been discussing . the number to call is ...
and i do n't want to invade your privacy --
look , doctor , i do n't want to be rude , but --
why not ?
no .
have you had any relationship since ?
it 's been about a year and a half .
good . how long ago did your wife die ?
all righ ...
i think it 's hard for him to talk to you about all this . maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better .
i 'm not mad at you . okay , i 'm not mad at you .
jesus , are we on the air ? jonah , for god 's sake --
dr. marcia fieldstone of network america .
who is this ?
i 'm not selling anything . your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife .
i 'm probably not interested in whatever you 're selling .
hello , sam , this is dr. marcia fieldstone on network america .
hello .
tell her how you do n't sleep at night .
i have no doubt that you 're a good dad . you can tell a lot from a person 's voice . but something must be missing if jonah feels that you 're still under a cloud .
fair enough .
okay , but if i get yelled at , i 'm never gon na listen to this show again .
i 'm sure he wo n't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him .
i do n't know --
well , i think i can help a little more if i talk to him directly .
yeah .
is he home right now ?
you want me to talk to him ?
it 's very hard for him to talk about this stuff . it 's like it makes him sadder .
why not ?
no .
i 'm worried about him , he 's worried about me , i ride my bike to school , he follows in the car , like i 'm not supposed to know he 's there . now it 's christmas , and you know what happens to people at christmas .
and you 're worried about him .
i 've been pretty sad , but i think my dad is worse .
i 'm sorry to hear that , jonah .
she died .
where 's your mom ?
he does n't have one now . that 's the problem .
you do n't like the one he was now ?
it 's not for me . it 's for my dad . i think he needs a new wife .
got me there . what 's your christmas wish , jonah ?
it 's not that late in seattle .
no last names , jonah . hello there , you sound younger than our usual callers . how come you 're up so late ?
right , right .
it is not --
it is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
no .
how about rapacious and love- starved ?
just because someone 's looking for a nice guy does n't make them desperate .
what kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio ?
they met at the empire state building , only they did n't . never mind .
this is going to be tougher than i thought .
you 'll like it .
some woman is going to want me to do it to her and i 'm not going to know what it is .
you 'll see .
what is it ?
you 'll find out .
what 's tira misu ?
great . they 'll have a parade in your honor . you 'll be man of the year in seattle magazine . tira misu .
i do n't think it could let a woman pay for dinner .
well . things are different . first , you have to be friends . you have to like each other . then you neck . this can go on for years . then you have tests . then you get to do it with a condom . the good news is , split the check .
seventy ... eight .
when 's the latest time you were out there ?
everywhere . you ca n't even turn on the news without hearing about how some babe thought some guy 's butt was cute . who the first babe to say this was i do n't know , but it caught on .
you mean , like , `` he has the cutest butt '' ? where did i hear that recently ?
and that 's what i 'm trying to tell you . what women are looking over , okay ? pecs and a cute butt .
i 'm not asking you to set me up , jay . that 's not what i need your help for . i want to know what it 's like over there .
sandy has a girlfriend , clenda ... she 's a weightlifter , but it 's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
well , okay . what 's the big deal ? if she 'll forget the new fireplace , i 'll marry her . just point me in the right direction .
hey , my plate is full .
i 'd rather die than eat on an airplane . i 'm telling them you 're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they wo n't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything .
i do n't know . do i ?
do you want a fruit plate ?
window .
do you want an aisle or a window seat ?
but how am i going to get there ?
i have forty-two . so that would definitely cover taxicabs , i think .
eighty dollars .
nobody knows . it changes practically every day . how much money do you have ?
do you know how much it costs to go to new york ?
you have to go to her , jonah . you have to find her .
i do n't get it .
this is the best movie i 've ever seen in my life .
your only hope .
yeah . what 's that ?
it 's y. o. h .
you think so ?
write her .
h and g. hi and goodbye .
dad , could you close the door ?
sure .
what do you mean , okay ? would n't you like a dog ?
okay .
maybe we 'll get a dog when we get back .
it was all they had .
i ca n't believe you flew first class .
no .
i mean , so far , have i screwed it up for you ?
no .
listen , have i ever done anything really stupid ?
if i did n't go .
when i found you ?
i was scared of what you were gon na do .
what if i could n't get to you ?
goddammit , i am sick of this --
no .
get out .
i 'm not leaving this room until you say yes .
i ca n't know what i said , but we 're not going .
did too .
did not .
you said we could go to new york .
this conversation is finished .
shut up ? shut up ? ? ? mom never did that . mom never said shut up to me . mom never yelled at me .
shut up .
what 's wrong with annie ?
thank you , jonah . but the point is , i am not asking permission .
fine . i wo n't say anything . you can marry count dracula .
this is the one i like .
i have to have a life . i have to do things that i want with people my own age . it 's none of your business who i am going out with . i do n't give a good goddam if you 're angry --
yes .
are you going with her ?
i 'm only going to be away one night , okay , and clarise will be here . you 'll have a swell time . you 'll watch a little geraldo , some nightmare on elm street 12 , i 'll never know .
it might be in the kitchen .
have you seen my wallet ?
i sincerely hope you are not going to marry jessica .
the reason i know this and you do n't is that i 'm younger and purer so i 'm more in touch with cosmic forces .
the one who wrote us .
who is annie ?
dad , i was talking to jessica about reincarnation , and she thinks that probably you knew annie in another life .
victoria ? she 's okay .
god , she 's beautiful .
i 'm never going to meet anyone who 's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes ? what do you think ? there 's a perfect woman walking around out there ?
was mom an adjustment ?
jonah , this is n't fair . you do n't know victoria . i hardly know her myself . she is , in fact , a mystery to me . she tosses her hair a lot . why does she do this ? i have no idea . is it a twitch ? does she need a haircut ? should she use barrette so it does n't keep falling in her face ? these are things that i 'm willing to get to the bottom of , and that is why i am dating her . that is all i am doing . i am not marrying her . can you appreciate the difference ? that 's what single people do , they try people on and they see if they fit . but nobody fits perfectly , everyone is an adjustment .
if she knew , she 'd never forgive me . it would be hopeless for the two of you .
this is not a joke . thank god victoria does n't know . it would really have hurt her feelings .
it 's a short word .
long enough to call victoria a ho .
i just called for a second .
everyone at work heard you .
no .
did you call that radio station again ?
that 's true . why is that ?
the water tastes better in the kitchen .
there 's a bathroom upstairs .
i was thirsty .
what are you doing up ?
i thought i saw a black widow spider .
do n't ever do that again .
i 'm glad you liked it . good night , jonah .
thanks for dinner . i never saw anybody cook potatoes that way .
thank victoria for dinner .
okay .
jonah !
it 's only ten o'clock .
okay , tiger . time for bed .
she 's going to cook something for us ?
why is she bringing that bag ?
there she is .
i figure we could go to new york , catch the knicks , and since we 'd be there anyway , obviously we 'd go to the empire state building --
perfect . we 'll be there .
she does n't want us to go to baltimore . she wants to meet us in new york city on valentine 's day . on top of the empire state building .
here is seattle . and here is baltimore . case closed .
oh , right .
it 's a sign .
everyone thinks brooks robinson is the greatest .
dad !
wait ! ! ! -- `` and while we 're on the subject , let 's just say right now that brooks robinson was the best third baseman ever . it 's important that you agree with me on that because i 'm from baltimore . '' dad , she thinks brooks robinson is the greatest .
jonah , i 'm leaving --
just this one part , okay ? `` i have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as i or anyone else can remember , and i guarantee you will not get one past me ''
not now , jonah --
listen to this --
now i 'm late . bye .
her name is annie . annie reed .
the heels on these shoes are very large . why have i never noticed this ? the heels on these shoes are grotesque .
this is a good letter , dad .
i look stupid . i look stupid , do n't i ? i look like i 'm trying too hard . i was going to get a haircut but then i thought i 'd look like i just got a haircut .
great .
sleepless and son . baltimore .
this one 's for both of us .
good .
i ... uh ... have a date with someone friday night .
i know . but she 's here , jonah . because i have you . and as long as i have you , i have your mom .
i 'm starting to forget her .
i never did . or the whole idea of an afterlife . but i do n't know any more . i have these dreams about ... your mom ... and we have long talks about ... about you , and how you are , which she sort of knows but i tell her anyway . so what is that ? it 's sort of an afterlife , is n't it ?
like do you believe in heaven ?
i do n't know .
i miss her . what do you think happens to someone after they die ?
is that what she used to sing ?
bye bye blackbird .
you 're worried we 're going to be all right . we 're going to be all right . i remember sometimes you 'd have nightmares as a baby . your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song .
our house . there was water coming in all the windows .
what was ?
it was sinking .
how do you know ?
i know .
dad , this is amazing . if you play this backwards , it says `` paul is dead . ''
it 's nice to meet you , jessica .
hi , dad . dad , this is jessica .
go to sleep .
jed 's got cables .
whose show was this on ?
in the movies women are always scratching up guy 's back and screaming and stuff . when they 're having sex .
what ?
will she scratch up your back ?
what do you think ?
if you get a new wife , i guess you 'll have sex with her , huh ?
i 'm starting to notice that .
it does n't . they ask you .
but not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you 're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it 's just a drink , if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you do n't you can go home if you see what i mean . i wonder if it still works this way .
-- a slice of pizza --
you see someone you like , you get a feeling about them , you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
english muffin . how do you do it ?
this is not how you do it . you want this on an english muffin or a bun ?
dad , you 're not taking this seriously .
she looks like my third grade teacher . i hated my third grade teacher . hold it ! wait a minute ! she < u > is < /u > my third grade teacher !
she 's willing to fly anywhere .
i 'm not going to think about what they 're not teaching you in school . i am not going to think about it . generally speaking i think we should rule out people who do n't live somewhere near here --
somewhere in the middle .
oklahoma . do you know where that is ?
this is no good . she 's looking for someone french . or greek . `` dear sleepless in seattle : i live in tulsa . '' where is that ? --
thank god . something you do n't know . it 's a single white female .
`` dear sleepless in seattle : i am an swf '' -- what is that ?
you have to give them your phone number or they wo n't let you go on the air .
how did they get our phone number ?
they called and asked for it . `` dear sleepless in seattle . you are the most attractive man i 've ever laid ears on . ''
just out of curiosity , how did they get our address ?
right . i 'm sorry , jonah , i 'm sorry .
stressed .
i 'm sorry . i 'm just --
i think i know how to have a spice rack .
should n't you have used a toggle bolt ?
sure . looking good .
so i can go .
fine . fine .
jed is having a slumber party new year 's eve and he invited me .
just out of curiosity , do you have any friends whose names do n't begin with a j ? i feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you jonah . what is marjoram ? does anyone know ?
i forgot to mention . jed called --
what ?
p. dad ?
does red pepper go under r or p ?
dad --
what 's the matter with this one ? would n't you like to have imelda marcos as your mother ?
no , i 'm not , but --
oh , you 're changing your mind --
dad , i do n't know about this one --
you 're right . you better hope so .
nobody else is going to know it was us .
what ? !
it plays in 50 states .
how many people do you think heard that thing last night ?
my feelings exactly .
not .
right .
it 's never happening again . right ?
dad ? about last night ?
we desperately need a spice rack . desperately .
it 's a spice rack .
the hopes are perfect -- beautiful , identical , smooth -- and they are for something really amazing i feel it in my bones --
i do n't think i have to now .
i can hear you walking around sometimes . at first i thought it was a robber . go ahead , tell her , dad .
there 's somebody on the phone for you . his name is sam .
what is it ?
dad --
i think they 're announcing your flight .
well ...
sure . i 'd really like that . thank you so much .
we ought to start camping again , dad .
i went camping once . i love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed .
do you like it ?
what about it ?
what about camping ?
yes , i do . in fact , my firm has box seats for the mariners . why do n't we all go next week ?
do you like baseball ?
hi . he should book now because we can get an excursion fare . jessica 's parents are travel agents and --
hi , sam . and let me guess -- you must be jonah .
well , here 's the number . if you ever find yourself sleepless , give us a call . we also ... do babysitting .
thanks , but ... we 've got plans .
we live two piers over , do n't we ? number 12 , right ? we 're having like a really neat open house today from like four to whenever if you care to stop by .
you must be jonah .
yes ?
hi . sam ?
hi .
look , i met somebody . she 's good , and capable and smart . we hit it off . we ca n't spend your life chasing after fantasies .
would you follow < u > her < /u > through an airport ?
anyway , victoria 's nice .
`` an affair to remember . '' did you ever see it ? cary grant and deborah kerr . before that it was called `` love affair with irene dunne and charles boyer . ''
what do you mean ?
it 's a little derivative .
now that i 'm seeing someone , it 's a whole other thing .
you 're kidding --
it 'll take him a while to come around . a month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them i needed a wife --
how 's jonah taking it ?
i tried to talk to her ... it was like i knew her . weird .
you saw her in the airport and then here ?
he 's over at the boat show . he 'll be by later . it 's so beautiful here .
god , it 's wonderful to see you . where 's greg ?
i 'm sorry --
move on . right . that 's what i 'm going to do . in a few months , boom , i 'll be fine , i 'll just grow a new heart .
eventually , in a few months , you 'll start seeing women , you 'll meet someone .
microwave . five minutes .
five minutes in the microwave . any one of them , five minutes and done . ready to eat . do you know how to make juice ?
sure . sure .
absolutely . when i come back , maybe the two of us should spend some time together , on our own . what do you think ?
it takes time --
i read the same article ...
i read an article about this ...
he 's good at it .
he 's ten .
absolutely . right .
no . after he was born , every time we started to make love , he would cry . he had an uncanny sense of timing . we really should n't do anything here anyway .
is he there ?
i 've already solved it . i 've hired a hit man .
i know her pretty well . maybe i could call her --
we ca n't finish the job . she 's on her sixth painter , now she 's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
so whatdya say ? i 'll get the check , and i 'll call you in eight months .
oh .
you < u > are < /u > the first woman i 'm going out with .
no way . no way i was going to be the first woman you went out with after ... there is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after ...
you could have called me --
i really wanted you to call me , and i thought you were never going to --
you did ?
i thought you were never going to call me .
you look good yourself .
you look good .
hi .
hi .
there 's nothing stopping you .
are you going to let us pass -- or do i have to call the sheriff ?
no . my name is quintero . mister quintero .
i mean it . i know your work record . you were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that ? you had a real future with this company , but you let those reds stir you up . and now they 'll sell you down the river . why do n't you wake up , ray ? that 's your name , is n't it , ray ?
that 's none of their affair .
the men would like to know who this gentleman is .
no thanks .
you 're welcome to one .
naturally . you think i parked here for a cup of coffee ?
want to go up to your office , mr. alexander ?
your foreman says that 's a foreman 's job .
why did n't you give a warning signal ?
i told you it would happen . it 's bound to happen when a man works alone !
i do n't make policy .
got any more ideas ?
no , just the ring leaders . the fire-eaters . and the ones with big families ... barton -- where 's that boy ?
you want 'em all arrested ?
you have n't tried locking them up !
i 've tried everything but shootin ' 'em down .
well ?
now do n't get excited , mr. alexander . they 'll scatter like a covey of quail .
whose side are you on anyway ?
not so sure about that . letter of the law , you know . all the injunction says is no picketing by miners .
well , those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning , but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail .
how 's it going ?
mornin ' .
you know ... what 's good for the goose is good for the gander .
what do you mean -- sex equality ?
he says give 'em equality . equality in jobs , equality in the home . also sex equality .
so ? what does he want to do about 'em ?
question , question -- the problem , what to do about 'em .
the woman question ?
it 's like charley vidal says -- there 's two kinds of slavery , wage slavery and domestic slavery . the woman question , he calls it .
yeah .
three hours ! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff ! i tell you something . if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do n't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us . it should 've been a union demand from the beginning .
it never ends .
how goes it ?
you ca n't send him back to oklahoma . it 'd be inhumane .
jenkins ai n't no boss . mean we 're gon na let people like jenkins stay here ?
no , no , it 's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make jenkins general manager . so why you acting so mean ?
it 's the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold .
now why do n't you let these gentlemen pass ? do n't you know who 's in that car ?
i say we got ta take action . now .
take a drink . calm down !
you 're a liar , pancho . a no-good , dirty ...
you were n't even there . you were back at the station . kalinsky told me ...
i checked the drift just before he blasted . it was all clear ... the man must have been asleep or something .
an american .
who ? a scab ?
you work alone , savvy ? you ca n't handle the job , i 'll find someone who can .
foreman wants to get the ore out . miner wants to get his brothers out . in one piece .
he will if he wants us to go on blasting .
now wait a minute . super 's the one made the rule . he ai n't gon na give you no helper .
so much the better .
super 's busy -- with your negotiatin ' committee .
you know the beef . this new rule of yours , that we work alone . we 're taking it up with the super .
hear you had a little trouble , quintero . defective fuse ? well , you 're all in one piece . so what 's the beef ?
yes . we will light the candles .
can we light the candles now ? on the cake ?
they are singing for me .
why are they singing , mama ?
hush ... not a word about the cake , hear ?
mama , can i put the candles ...
later . when i finish the ironing .
are you sad ? are we going to church ? for your confession ?
no , estellita .
are you sick , mama ?
with ramn it 's ... pride . i spoke out of the bitterness in me . and he was hurt .
so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away .
good . come in , we 'll work it out . sit down , sit down .
it 's all set . consuelo 's squad can take they day off tomorrow . we 're taking over .
do n't you worry . we 'll get some action .
he ca n't drink this milk . it 'll make him sick . he 's on a formula . i was a fool ! i should n't have kept him with me .
no . no . i ca n't . if ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
come on , esperanza -- how about it ? we got to .
sure . where they 're negotiating . in the company office . we 'll go up there and picket the place .
to the mine ?
this means they 've given up trying to break the picket line . now we can all fight together -- all of us .
what are you saying ?
this is what we 've been waiting for .
and if you ca n't understand this you 're a fool -- because you ca n't win this strike without me ! you ca n't win anything without me !
will you be still ?
whose neck shall i stand on , to make me feel superior ? and what will i get out of it ? i do n't want anything lower than i am . i 'm low enough already . i want to rise . and push everything up with me as i go ...
shut up , you 're talking crazy .
yes . i talk of dignity . the anglo bosses look down on you , and you hate them for it . `` stay in your place , you dirty mexican '' -- that 's what they tell you . but why must you say to me , `` stay in your place . '' do you feel better having someone lower than you ?
you talk of dignity ? after what you 've been doing ?
no , you do n't . have you learned nothing from this strike ? why are you afraid to have me at your side ? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
charley 's my friend . i need friends . why are you afraid to have me as your friend ?
charley vidal says ! do n't throw charley vidal up to me !
i do n't know . but i can feel it coming . it 's like ... like a lull before the storm . charley vidal says ...
like what ?
ramn were not getting weaker . we 're stronger than ever before . they 're getting weaker . they thought they could break our picket line . and they failed . and now they ca n't win unless they pull off something big , and pull it off fast .
who said anything about giving up ? i 'll never go back to the company on my knees . never .
you mean you 're ready to give up ?
aah ! they 've got other mines . you do n't see the larger picture . they 've got millions . millions . they can outlast us , and they know it .
it 's a lot to them . they 'd do anything to open that mine .
and you know why ? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two , three months . what 's it to them if the mine 's shut down a little longer ?
whose funeral ? we 're doing all right . there has n't been a scab near the picket line for three days .
sure , the standby squad . stand-by for the funeral .
but you are needed . especially now -- with most of the other men away . you 're captain of the stand-by squad .
why not ? i 'm not needed here .
ramn -- you ca n't .
no .
alone ?
sun up .
when ?
hunting .
where are you going ?
no . we ca n't ca n't go on this way . we ca n't go back to the old way either .
we ca n't go on this way . i just ca n't go on living with you . not this way .
tell me .
but you wanted to talk . tell me .
be still ...
that meeting only lasted ten minutes . the first night i 'm home , and you run to the beer parlor . what is it ? ca n't you bear the sight of me ?
you were n't waiting for me .
i waited up till midnight .
yes . to plan for the picket line tomorrow .
a meeting ?
all right , but later . i 've got a meeting now .
we 've got to have a talk , you and me .
no , no ... the sheriff had enough of us . we drove him crazy .
but if you go back they 'll lock you up again .
no , no ... we would n't do it .
did you have to sign a pledge ? not to go back to the line ?
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in .
four nights . how did you sleep ?
i 'm okay . but it 's nice to be home .
how do you feel ?
okay . then , tomorrow , i take the kids with me to the picket line .
i 'm telling you . i do n't stay home with these kids tomorrow .
i 've had them since the day they were born .
you might get hurt . listen , if you think i 'm gon na play nursemaid from now on , you 're crazy ... i 've had these kids all day !
i 'm going back tomorrow .
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime , huh ?
yes .
must 've been some experience for you , huh ?
sure .
you all right ?
backward .
can be what ?
anglo husbands can also be backward .
there 's jenkins ' wife . you do n't see her on no picket line .
no , she wants to be there . and there 's mrs. kalinsky .
she 's the organizer 's , wife . she 's got to be there .
yes , i do . there 's ruth barnes .
the union do n't run my house . those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you do n't see any of them down there .
but the motion passed . it 's ... it 's not democratic of you to ...
no .
it 's not fair ... i should be there with them . after all , i 'm the one who got the women the vote .
ca n't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time ?
but it 's yours . i wo n't let them ...
i do n't want your dead body . i do n't want you back in jail either .
over my dead body .
let them take it !
because if we lose , we lose more than a strike . we lose the union . and the men know this . and if we win , we win more than a few demands . we win ... ... something bigger . hope . hope for our kids . juanito ca n't grow strong on milk alone .
what makes you so sure ?
not just juanito . you 'll have it good too , esperanza . we 're going to win this strike .
i 'd lie on my cot in the cell and i could n't sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat . and i 'd say to myself , think of something nice . something beautiful . and then i 'd think of you . and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you .
you are no good to me -- in jail .
they say i am no good to you .
what were they saying ? about you ? in there ?
he 'll have it good . some day .
drink , drink , juanito . you 'll never have it so good .
he was born fighting . and born hungry .
a fighter , huh ?
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
mother of god ... have mercy ...
it 's nothing . just a little catch ...
what 's the matter ?
i did forget . lus told me .
forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me .
antonio paid for it .
was it expensive , the beer ?
no , no ...
i 'm a fool .
i did not mean to weep again . why should i weep for joy ?
aaah , what 's the use ?
never ... never ... never !
stop it ! the children are watching . stop it !
if i think of myself it 's because you never think of me . never . never . never ...
is that all you care about ? that radio ? ca n't you think of anything except yourself ?
all right . have your strike . i 'll have my baby . but no hospital will take me , because i 'll be a striker 's wife . the store will cut off our credit , and the kids will go hungry . and we 'll get behind on the payments again , and then they 'll come and take away the radio ...
esperanza , have you forgotten what it was like before the union came ? when estella was a baby , and we could n't even afford a doctor when she got sick ? it was for our families ! we met in graveyards to build that union !
what has it got me , your union ?
now do n't start talking against the union again .
i see . the men . you 'll strike , maybe , for your demands -- but what the wives want , that comes later , always later .
first we got to get equality on the job . then we 'll work on these other things . leave it to the men .
the safety of the men -- that 's more important ! five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up . you 're a woman , you do n't know what it 's like up there .
what 's more important than sanitation ?
we ca n't get everything at once . right now we 've got more important demands .
what ?
we did . it got lost in the shuffle .
do you think i like living this way ? what do you want of me ? !
forget it ? i chop wood for the stove five times a day . every time i remember . i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes . and bathrooms . inside .
forget it .
i 'm sorry . the fire 's gone out .
this water 's cold again .
got to talk to the brothers .
where you going ?
i listen to it . every night . when you 're out to the beer parlor .
but you had to have it , did n't you ? it was so nice to listen
it is n't right , she says . was it right that we bought this ... this instrument ?
we 're only one payment behind . i argued with her . it is n't right .
me , i 'm a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana , colorado , idaho . but did he ever think to organize the women ? no . wives do n't count in the anglo locals either .
aw , cut it out , ruth .
look who 's talking ! the great white father , and world 's champion of women 's rights .
we ca n't think of them just as housewives -- but as allies . and we 've got to treat them as such .
or why do n't you just put a sign outside ? `` no dogs or women allowed ! ''
but honey ...
why did n't you support her ? you 're the worst of the lot .
maybe not . but there 's another thing ... like when you came in tonight -- i heard you ask your wife , `` who 's that ? his grandfather ? ''
you know i do n't think that .
well , you 're the organizer . you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you 're dead right . but when you figure everything the rank-and-file 's to do down to the last detail , you do n't give us anything to think about . you afraid we 're too lazy to take initiative ?
go on . spill it .
yeah . lots of provocation lately . they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge , maybe they can bust the strike .
hear those deputies slugged 'cente .
okay , so discrimination hurts the anglo too , but it hurts me more . and i 've had enough of it !
exactly . and equality 's the one thing the bosses ca n't afford . the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is , `` well -- at least you get more than the mexicans . ''
because most of us here are mexican- americans ! because we want equality with anglo miners -- the same pay , the same conditions .
then why 's the company hanging tough ? they 've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one ?
do n't horse me . price of zinc 's never been higher . they do n't want no strike -- not with their war boom on .
are we talking to a union spokesman ?
it 's possible . just negotiate .
well , if that 's possible ...
too bad . the men 've always wanted to get a look at the president . but you 've come out here to settle the strike ?
no ...
new york ? you 're not the company president by any chance ?
no . new york .
you mean delaware ?
that 's all right -- it 's no secret . my name 's hartwell . i 'm from the company 's eastern office .
you should have helped her without being asked .
but you 've got me doing everything . mama never used to make me dry the ...
you 've got to help around the house !
but papa -- you need all the help you can get .
do n't i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school ?
the junior shop stewards . there 's lots of ways we can help .
the what !
papa , ca n't i leave now ? there 's a meeting of the junior shop stewards ...
i do n't want you hanging around there , hear ?
boy ! did you see the way mama whopped that deputy with her shoe ? knocked the gun right out ...
she 's coming . charley vidal gave her a lift .
where 's your mama ?
papa ! we seen 'em ! two scabs ! over there !
lus ! come down here !
it 's mama 's saint 's day .
forgot what ?
i thought maybe you forgot ...
what are you doing here ? something wrong with mama ?
you think i was going to work you over ? i would n't dirty my hands with you ...
i know , it 's wrong . just let me go . i 'll leave town ... just let me go .
you think my kids have enough to eat , you rat ?
my kids do n't have enough to eat !
t ! traidor a tu gente ! rompehuelga ! desgraciado !
ramn -- listen my kids ...
you judas ... blood-sucker ...
ramn ... listen to me ... i 'm in a jam ... i had to get a job ...
you ... you ... i 'd expect it of an anglo , yes ... but you ...
ramn ... listen for the love of god ...
maybe . i think he 's got a few things to learn about our people .
sure . but you want the truth ? you 're even suspicious of him .
he 's a guest in my house , is n't he ?
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses .
what attitude ?
and another thing . your attitude toward anglos . if you 're gon na be a leader ...
do the bosses wait ? no sanitation . so my kids get sick . does the company doctor wait ? twenty bucks . so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife . does the company store wait ? `` pay -- or we take it away . '' why they in such a hurry , the bosses ' store ? they 're trying to scare us , that 's why -- to make us afraid to move . to hang on to what we got -- and like it ! well , i do n't like it i 'm not scared ... and i 'm fed up -- to here !
but you do n't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union . you wait till you 're ready , so you can win .
i was talking to my wife .
no , i do n't mind . that 's how come i told you about it .
you mind ?
yeah ? first door on the right . it ai n't that dirty . just kinda ' filthy is all .
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road ?
good . i fucking hate australians .
no .
are you australian ?
that 's it ?
what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom . it 'll take you right to the highway .
bobby , bobby , bobby . rhymes with ...

because i do n't know him and i do n't really know you , partner .
why ? the guys is ready to deal now .

why ?
will you do that ? then i want you to get out of the room .
i do n't want to .
never mind . just do what i say . he holds out the baggie . colette backs away .
what is it ?
i want to do this for you . i want to do something good for a change .
really , i do n't want to .
nothing could be worse then this slow death i 'm living now .
they would have killed you too .
no , you 're wrong , i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up . i could have done something .
i ca n't tell you .

therapy session is over .

you do n't like the tune , find another station .
there you go again . you 're nothing but false notes .

how much time do you have ?
what is wrong with you ?
how much time do you have ?
yes . why do you find that so hard to believe ?
so you 're just attracted to me , is that it ?
this has nothing to do with him .

you really need to lighten up .
it gets me through the day .
i do n't want anything . why are you so suspicious ?
what do you want from me , colette ?
nothing .
: what are you up to ?
i try .
is that how you play ?
it 's the only way to play .
and you admire that ?
dude played his soul right out the end of the horn . no false notes . always honest .
nah . i 'm strictly minor league ... except for the fucked-up part .
like you ?
just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music .
never heard of him .
miles davis . `` all blues . ''
trust me . we 're safe .
how far out of town ?
do n't worry . he 's out of town .
turns out i 'm allergic to steel-toed boots . go figure . by the way , i 'm not looking for a matching set . where 's quincey ?
what happened to your eye ?
oh . hi .
how ?
then make sure he gets put away for longer .
i ca n't . i 've got a kid . she lives with my parents . quincey knows where they live .
that 's long enough to get out of town .
why ? they do n't hold him for more than a day or two .
why do n't you call the cops ?
because he 'll kill me .
then why do n't you leave ? just give me one good reason .
fuck you .
you get off on abuse or something ?
i ca n't leave .
there 's nothing to understand . the guy is a pig .
you do n't understand .
why not ?
i ca n't .
then leave .
who the fuck are you , dr. joyce brothers ? i hate the son-of-a-bitch .
do n't tell me , down deep he 's really not a bad person and you do n't want to see him get hurt .
it 's not that easy .
look , it 's really none of my business but why do n't you just dump this guy ?
go ahead .
nothing .
what ?
colette ...
oh , he 's a keeper all right .
this man sounds like a real catch .
do n't worry , he 's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now .
ouch .
could be worse . oh sorry , forgot who i was talking to .
that bad , huh ?
leave me out of this .
what about the guy on the very bottom ?
i do n't know ... . you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hope 's stool specimen .
how ?
come on , cheer up . it could be worse .
oh god .
i was thinking alice cooper .
jesus , i look like a raccoon .
i understand . thanks anyway .
look ... i 'd like to help you out ... but i really do n't want to get involved .
can you do me a favor ? this girl i know , her boyfriend 's a real piece of shit-dude 's really jamming her up . i promised her i 'd try to help .
what ?
oh shit
hey , you did the right thing . you would n't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself . they have eaten your ass alive .
i 'm fine . little nervous ... little disappointed that i did n't finish this myself .
how you holding up ?
these guys are smart . i knew they would n't hit a deal unless they knew all the players . i needed a big buyer .
that 's when he called me . he told me his story and he pitched me a plan .
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for , i 'd have to set up a deal so sweet , they would n't be able to walk away from it .
how ?
it 's not too late to show her you 're sorry .
i do n't buy that . there 's a place for hatred . did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed ? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her . do you know what that feels like ?
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker .
i 'm genuinely happy that you found some peace , nancy . but you ca n't forgive for liz . no one can . and you ca n't forgive for me .
i know it 's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
maybe i am dealing with it .
you 've got to deal with this sooner or later , tom . you ca n't keep hiding .
is that what you want me to do ? put it all on jesus ? let him sort it out in the afterlife ?
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter . i gave my grief to jesus christ .
closure ? how do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there ?
billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago . said you looked so bad , he barely recognized you .
all right , nancy , how 'd you track me down ?
it 's tom .
who is it ?
you 're a good man . jimmy the finn .
would n't be a favor if you were paying me . i 'll just take my five when the deal is done .
good for you jimmy .
nah ... i want to keep it . maybe i can use it for like , inspiration ... you know ... like when i detox ?
i 'm sorry . i could n't .
i do n't know ... a little . i wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning .
because i do n't want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers . i thought that maybe if you knew that i did n't use , you might see it in yourself to go clear .
wait if you do n't trust me , why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs ?
and you want me to do you some big favor ?
i do n't trust anybody .
you do n't trust me ?
i ca n't tell you .
but ... why ? why would you pretend ?
are you kidding me ? a bunch of amped -out tweakers ? it was easy .
no one ever noticed ?
you ever notice how i always showed up , in the middle of a binge ? left before it was over ? how i sneak away for cap-naps ? how when the crank came around to me , i always said i 'd just done one ?
this is n't like that queen elizabeth question , is it ?
when ? when did you ever see me use ?
but ... i 've seen you .
i 'm not a tweaker . i do n't use drugs . i never had .
what ?
it 's you ! i did n't have a picture or nothin ' so i had to describe you to the guy . not bad though , huh ?
what the hell is that ?
hey , check it out ...
jimmy , look , there 's something i have to tell you .
you 're my best friend , man . i 'd do anything for you .
why ?
it do n't matter . i 'll do it . and you sure as hell do n't have to pay me .
wait till i tell you what it is .
okay
you are n't coming with me .
but why ? you only owe me five . and that 's not till after we close the deal tonight .
tem thousand dollars . everything i could spare . it 's for you .
what 's this ?
thanks for not laughing at me .
yes , jimmy .
danny ?
yes , jimmy
was he the president ?
john fitzgerald kennedy .
what does j.f.k . stand for ?
sure , jimmy .
can i ask you something ?
no . i 'm good .
you want a hit ?
no you think she 's a tweaker ?
you ever see queen elizabeth sleep ?
you 're going to have to give me a little more than that , jimmy .
he does n't have one .
you 're going to have to explain that one .
i think on account of his nose .
why do they call him pooh-bear ?
palmdale
yeah , that 's what i mean . where the hell does this guy live anyway ?
you mean , like to throw 'em off ?
you know , jimmy , you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over .
personal protection . it 's a dangerous world we live in , jimmy , a very dangerous world .
hey , why do you need a gun and a vest anyway ?
not tonight .
you wan na score some go-fast ?
the del ammo mall mostly .
jimmy , where do you find these people ?
10 % . that 's ...
i 'm getting a 10 % finder 's fee from my man if i can get the right price .
sure .
can you set that up ?
i think so . i mean , we 'd have to talk to him .
can your man handle that ?
fuuuuuck
a quarter of a million , jimmy .
a quarter ? danny that ai n't even worth ...
i know a buyer . guy 's looking for a quarter 's worth .
yeah , pooh-bear . dude is a big-time cook . i 'm talking dire .
you remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up ?
i find myself in dire need of some cash .
do n't get carried away .
you . you 're smooth . you use words like dire and shit . you got language skills , man .
what ?
see that ? that 's just what i 'm talking about .
business . i need to leave town and i find myself in dire need of some cash .
so , why 'd you want to see me ?
i guess there 's just no substitute for good genes .
i 'm serious , dude . you always seem to be on top of things , even when you 're tweakin ' .
that 's a good one .
you 're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine . here . have a beer .
why does it have to feel so bad ?
sorry .
was . i 'm on the fucking ghost train right now , man . you got anything for me ?
you on a roll ?
i 'm hurting .
oh ... that . ah , he was just juiced . he would n't have did nothin '
nice dealer you got there , jimmy .
well , jimmy the finn , let 's go score some gack .
finland is a country .
you do n't say .
my features . they 're finnish .
why 's that ?
jimmy . everyone calls me jimmy the finn .
i had n't noticed . i 've seen you around . what 's your name ?
nice day
lead the way .
i know a guy .
where to ?
midnight ?
twelve
what time is it ?
guess it 's our turn .
how the hell did we get this detail ?
understand what ?
you do n't understand .
you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose . or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter ?
what does that mean ?
by not disgracing her memory !
you never did like me much , did you verne ? and you ca n't stand it that i walked out of there alive and liz did n't . you think i 'm a coward , do n't you ?
that was my idea .
then why do n't i see any pictures of me up there ?
yeah , dickhead .
cool it . we got business .
what the fuck are you gon na do about it , dickhead ?
this is bullshit . you did n't say anything about anybody else being here .
just some buddies .
what the hell is this ?
i 'll keep that in mind .
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they did n't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel ?
no one . it was just a test . i need to be sure of who i 'm dealing with from time-to-time .
what the hell was that ? who told you i was five-0 ?
do n't do that . please . or i 'll kill you . please , danny .
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now .
yeah .
can i pull my fucking dick out ? !
i did n't fucking do anything ! i swear to god !
now get talkin '
okay ! okay !
shoot him .
uh-uh-uh ...
please .. i do n't know what you 're ...
do n't address me . i did n't make the accusation .
what ? !
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police .
big bill
pooh-bear . come on , man . what is this ? it 's me , danny . i thought we had a deal .
big bill .
come on , guys ...
pull your motherfucking pants down .
i 'm sorry ?
pull your pants down .
you want to do this some other time ?
hey , i do n't play that .
i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal .
hey , i was just trying to ...
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman .
why do you say that ?
maybe you 're the one who is n't taking me seriously .
pooh-bear , i do n't mean to be rude , but i get the feeling you are n't taking me seriously .
if you say so .
so that 's 40 lbs . at 6 a pound then ?
but you 're a friend of jimmy 's . i think of you as a brother already .
but i just met you .
anything for a dear friend .
you 're serious ?
hey , okay .
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce .
i deal in u.s. pounds , friend . none of that faggot metric crap for me .
i do n't know , 14,000 a kilo ?
make me an offer .
can we talk price ?
secret recipe .
not bad .
i insist . it 's delicious . just a taste .
no , i 'm good .
i 'm sorry . would you like a taste ?
the good stuff . can you handle that ?
crank or glass ?
yeah , i uh , have a buyer who 's looking for about a quarter 's worth .
no shit ? fuck it . i 'll send it to oliver stone then . he 'll get them to reopen the bastard .
um , i think the warren commission has been closed for a while .
i 'm gon na get this developed and send it to the warren commission .
answer the fucking question !
please ... do n't do this ...
yeah . okay . listen carefully ... you 're in the bathroom . you 've been shot in the shoulder ...
whatever you say , man . look ... can we talk about this ?
my name is tom .
danny ?
yeah .
i thought you 'd be happy .
jesus .
took a pig-slicker to the heart .
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant .
murder . beautiful .
we got the 411 on your good old boy .
that 's real sweet , garcetti . thanks .
who is it ?
i 'm afraid so , danny .
what ? is it bad ?
that 's probably what he would have done if we had n't found out about your get-rich-quick scheme .
what 's to stop him from just ripping me off then ?
guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers . as least that 's what the word is .
whata you mean ? he told me -
that 's because he does n't have one .
you think you 're so god damned smart , do n't you ?
news-flash , tanner . i 'm a fucking rat .
bullshit . he 's a liar .
no . you just handed us a new one . we can go federal on your ass right now : ongoing criminal conspiracy . intent to buy and distribute $ 250,000 worth of crank . what 's the mandatory on that , al ?
for that old possession charge ? gim me a break .
well , if you 'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
whata you mean i 've got no choice ?
you 've got no choice .
look man , i just wanted to make some dough and disappear . i did n't want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him .
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off ?
standard vig . minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn , who 's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory .
what 're your taking down ?
after that ass-whipping you gave me ?
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass , flynne .
bubba .
this chink have a name ?
i met the guy at a party . he said he wanted to do a biggie . he 's new in town so i offered my services .
i ca n't help it , tanner , you hit like a fucking girl .
you think this is funny motherfucker ?
okay , asshole , you wan na play , we 'll play .
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here ?
cut the shit , flynne .
i was trying to score some dope .
question is , what are you doing here ?
what the hell are you doing here ?
soon . i promise . we 'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear . in the mean time , trust me , he has no idea that you ratted him out .
when ?
look , we 'll talk to the a.d.a .
danny , he is n't gon na find out it 's you . domingo was a slinger , he must have sold to hundreds of different people .
if he finds out it 's me , i 'm a dead man .
tell me what ?
i was getting to it .
bobby laid his own tracks . he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end . and as far as i 'm concerned , he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him . now take the money .
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid .
just the way the world works . look , as far as tweakers go , you are n't a bad guy . you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know .
you do n't find that repugnant ?
the money ? the drugs ? keeping yourself out of jail ? i know the drill .
do n't you wonder why i do it ?
it 's not my place .
thanks for not judging me .
garcetti thinks everything is shit . he does n't even like dolphins .
garcetti thinks i 'm a pile of shit .
hard to compare the people you 're taking down with the lord .
you think i 'm a judas ?
do n't be . i 'm worried about the kid .
danny , i 'm touched .
somebody has to help you lazy bastards .
god damn , flynne , you are one observant tweaker .
yeah . pretty sure . oh yeah ... he had a spear gun , too .
it was all pretty informal . did n't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries .
no last name ?
never mind . dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts .
what ?
bobby , rhymes with hobby .
you got a name ?
well , you know what they say , just because you 're paranoid , does n't mean everyone 's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat .
feeling the paranoia tonight , are we ?
if it 's all the same to you , i 'd rather not dish right here in the middle of crankville .
you go , boy .
i 've got a hot one .
with you clowns watching my back ? what do you think ?
nervous ?
did n't you hear ? domingo 's dead .
you know , i 'm starting to think i 'd rather take my chances with domingo than go through any more of this shit .
i 'm making the small buy tonight ... if i do n't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something . if everyone is happy , we 'll do the big deal later in the week .
when is the deal going down ?
worse . much worse . a teacher .
come on ! who is it ? domingo 's boys ?
you mean the menacing red car ?
speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me ?
what if he caps me before you can make a move ?
we 're coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we 'll have your sorry ass covered .
funny , i do n't feel lucky .
you 're lucky , flynne .
they have . but they never found a lab .
why does n't palmdale p.d . just raid the guy ?
several possession charges , but nothing major .
excuse me ?
no . you 've got me all wrong . i mean , in you own pussified way , you actually got some nuts in your little sack .
lay off , garcetti . i 'm not in the mood .
who 'd have thought it ? danny `` chickenshit '' flynne trying to go large right under our noses .
hell , yes ! what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler ?
what 'd you do , piss your pants ?
that would be me .
what 's that smell ?
oh they 're all that and the proverbial bag of chips .
sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens , flynne .
now that i can help you with . nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear . he 's a chef . check with palmdale p.d . i 'm sure they 're keeping box scores on the guy .
what 's on the other end of this thing ?
and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one . you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker , flynne . might just as well broadcast it on the evening news .
he 's the only one i told .
who the hell is jimmy ?
jimmy ?
i still do n't know what you 're talking about .
we know what 's going on .
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time ?
fuck you , garcetti . i been at this for almost a year . i 've done everything you guys have asked of me .
and he 's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was .
what ? !
he knows somebody ratted him .
and what does this have to do with me ?
the mexicali boys
to who ?
turns out he 's connected .
yeah . what about him ?
danny , it 's really pains me to have to tell you this , but do you remember domingo , that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back ?
garcetti , you 're teeth , they 're fucking perfect .
i 'll tell you why you did n't help - because you 're a chickenshit tweaking snitch . you 're a bottom feader , flynne .
hey , you want me to do all your work for you , numbnuts ?
then why did n't you help the kid when you were there ?
what 's he holding ?
dude is bugging . transparent spiders , plastic men - the whole nine yards .
cut to the fucking chase , flynne .
that 's him . he 's a lot prettier in person though .
it speaks !
this the guy ?
why are you doing this ?
my sentiments exactly .
that is so unfair .
but that 's okay , liz , you 're the one with the steady job , you pay all the bills . i 'm just an unemployed musician . you have every right .
here it comes , poor tom .
no . you know what gets old ? being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up .
quit feeling sorry for yourself , tom . it gets old .
we all know how much you like hearing that . okay , liz , i was wrong . there . you happy ?
just admit you 're wrong .
just no pleasing you , is there ?
i wanted you to ask back there . you know , before you got us lost .
first you want me to ask for directions , then you do n't . which is it ?
look at that place . it 's creepy .
what do you mean ?
you think that 's a good idea ?
okay , okay . there 's a house up there . i 'll go ask for directions .
tom , quit fucking around .
hey , do you think you could eat me if you had to ? and if so , which part do you think you would find the most delicious ?
you mean like the donner party ?
come on , where 's your pioneer spirit ?
why did n't you just ask for directions back there ?
no . right here on the beach . come on . let 's do it .
there 's no motels around here .
tom , let 's spend the night here .
it 's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch .
really ?
and you 've got wiener breath .
you , madam , are a heartless wench .
i was talking about miles .
again , i thank you .
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it .
thank you . thank you very much .
a virtuoso rendition . tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis ' haunting , moody piece .
maybe he is n't showing .
where 's bubba ?
yeah , i 'd hate to shoot you by accident .
just make sure you hit the floor when we come in . it could get ugly in there .
good work , flynne . you 're a first-rate rat .
we 're in business .
now that 's scary !
she 's 57 and she 's been teaching third grade for the last 33 years .
do n't we always take good care of you ?
golly , i had n't thought of that .
that 's not good in prison . it 's just not good .
and believe me , word will get out that you 're a pro rat .
yeah . this could be the one we 're looking for .
you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
i thought you were done .
jesus jimmy , you at the alpha team .
no , you ca n't taste it . it 's the fucking lab ! now shut up .
i just want to be straight on the details . can i taste it ?
do n't worry about it .
what is that ? rum and coke ?
better than drugs .
what is it , drugs ?
danny , listen up . here 's the deal ... my wife 's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab . they 're getting a very special delivery a week from this friday .
thank you , sir .
good luck , john .
the numbers do n't make sense , sir . his brothers are dead , that 's too bad , but they 're out of the equation . sending men up there is bleeding heart crapola from three thousand miles away . one private is simply not worth a squad . colonel anderson this one is . he 's worth a lot more than that . which is why i 'm sending you , you 're the best field officer there is .
alright , i 'll give you that . continue .
respectfully , sir , sending men all the way up to ramelle to save one private does n't make a fucking , goddamned bit of sense . sir .
spit it out , captain .
but , sir ... i ... i ...
he 's the last of four brothers , the other three were killed in action . this is straight from the chief of staff .
a private , sir ?
there 's a private james ryan who parachuted in with the hundred-and- first near ramelle . i want you to take a squad up there . if he 's alive , bring him back to the beach for debarkation . take whoever you need , you 've got your pick of the company .
sir ?
i 'm sending simpson to take over for you , the division is going to caen , you 're not coming with us , i have something else for you .
pinned down , a mile east of here , waiting for some help from the navy guns .
where are your men now ?
yes , sir .
it was a hard assignment , that 's why you got it .
they did n't want to give up those one-fifty-fives , sir .
fourty-four , twenty one dead .
casualties ?
a company , wehrmacht , no artillery , we took twenty-three prisoners , turned them over to intelligence .
resistance ?
sector four is secured , we put out the last three german one-fifty-fives , found them about two miles in from ponte du hoc .
report .
... alright , let me know when .
find a chaplain .
shit , that was no big deal .
did you see what he did , back there ? he stepped right into the open , so i could get across .
you take account of the wind ?
forty-two-hundred , i figure .
that must be four thousand yards .
not where i come from .
you must be a hell a shot .
yep .
the army gave you that ?
thirty-ought-six , norton long-barrel with dual-groove , parallel rifling , elevated three-glass scope and a single-throw hammer .
what about the captain ? where 's he from ?
we got us a tent , forty-two feet across , eighteen feet at center , hundred-and-ten foldin ' chairs . circuit 's eleven towns , covers all 'a hasset county and most 'a weller county . i expect that upon completion of my military service i will be joinin ' said ministry .
so they travel around from place to place and preach ?
i do n't make jokes about things of , or related to , the preaching of the holy gospel , including the ministerial calling of my family .
no kidding .
in the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch hudson with a big ole ' trailer .
in west fork ?
i 'm jackson . i 'm from west fork , tennessee . my pappy 's a preacher . him and his two brothers got a ministry , the blessed church of the wandering gospel .
figured .
as a matter of fact , i am .
you writin ' a book or somethin ' ?
so , where are you from ?
i am , but i like imported whiskey . so there i am and i hear the biggest ole ' coon you ever did hear , 'a rustlin ' right there in front of me . that ole ' boy comes right out of the brush , i got a clear shot and he knows he 's 'bout to meet his maker . i aim , i got my finger tight on the trigger and then i just smile and say to that ole ' coon , go on , now , you get out 'a here . then i sit down on a hollow log and take me a right long pull a ' that mash whiskey .
jackson , how many times i got to tell you , you 're from tennessee .
me ? i 'm walking with my hound , lucy , it 's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we 're out huntin ' coon . i got me a flask of pure kentucky mash whiskey ...
what deal ?
no kiddin ' ?
like hell , you did .
well , i 'll be goddamned , i knew it .
nope , he ai n't wade .
he ai n't wade .
i guess .
he ai n't half-bad , i guess .
i mean , ryan , what do you think of him ?
i think i 'm we got that eighty-eight .
what do you think ?
hell , no !
reiben , are you makin ' fun 'a the way i talk ?
y'all come back .
of course , sir .
yes , sir .
cap'n ... ?
he 's right , we ca n't shoot him ... well , we could but we 'd get in an enormous amount of trouble . and he 's right about the bridge , it 's a hell of a lot more important than he is .
looks like a flaming asshole to me .
so , that 's ryan .
yep , you step on a rusty nail , get lockjaw , never say another word as long as you live .
you know what the best possible thing that could happen is ?
the hell he did n't .
just shut up , ryan did n't kill wade .
you shut up , this is the most fucked up mission i ever heard of . goddamned ryan , fuck the little bastard .
shut up , will you ?
fuck private james ryan , fuck him , just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch .
wade , sarge , corporal insect , all of us , hell , i 'll bet even the captain has a mother .
last i knew .
they got squirrels there , too , right ?
reiben , how many time i got to tell you , i 'm from tennessee .
you know what a b.a.r . weighs ? nineteen and a half pounds , not counting ammo . and you think these things are comfortable ? they may look good but they weigh twelve pounds each , that 's thirty-six pounds , right there .
army life is too dang easy , my feet have gone soft . back home , we go out squirrel huntin ' , i walk forever and a day and then some , do n't even raise a blister .
if we find ryan and he 's still alive , that son-of-a-bitch is gon na carry this goddamned b.a.r . back to the beach for me .
hell , no . i think he 's the best officer in the whole goddamned army , bar none .
you got somethin ' against the cap'n ?
no one 's gon na win the money for the simple reason that the captain never was a civilian . they assembled him at o.c.s . out of spare body parts from dead g.i. 's . i know this for a fact .
hell , no , last time i shot a corporal , cap'n miller near bit my head off .
jackson ?
to each , his own .
it 's worth it .
do n't that get kind of expensive , cap'n ?
you see , i 've got the best house in all of addley . it 's not the biggest house , but it 's got the best location , right next to the junior high baseball field . the garage windows face left field . the guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen s put over them . the first thing i did when i bought the place was take off those screens . two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows . it takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far . i look at my garage windows as a motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up , the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship . i lay there in my hammock and every time i hear the sound of breaking glass , i know we 're one step closer to winning it all .
say what , cap'n ?
i 'm in my backyard , lying in my hammock , with my arm around my wife , listening for the sound of breaking glass .
keep trying .
not yet .
good , now get your goddamned gear .
sir , i understand . i do n't like it , but i understand .
you 'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve . there is no wade , there was one , but he died a long time ago , he 's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name , you understand ?
sir , i understand what you 're doin ' , but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner .
who 's wade ?
sir , i ai n't feeling so chipper on account of wade .
what the hell 's the matter with you , jackson ?
gives wade the second shot .
watching .
they do n't send planes to put out machine guns . two flank runners with surpressing fire . i 'm going right , whoever goes left has to be fast .
we left them eighty-eights .
my guess , too .
in the shadow by those two trees .
where ?
wade ?
yes , sir . it seems to me , sir , that the entire resources of the united states army oughta be dedicated to one thing and one thing only , and that is to put me and this here weapon on a rooftop , smack-dab in the middle of berlin , germany . now i ai n't one to question decisions made up on high , sir , but it seems to me that saving one private , no matter how grievous the losses of his family , is a waste of my god-given talent .
reiben , i want you to listen closely to jackson . this is the way to gripe . jackson , continue .
seems to me , cap'n , this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources . miller go on .
i 'd love to hear it .
sir , i have an opinion on this matter .
i most likely would have , sir , had i been given the opportunity .
you did n't volunteer , jackson .
captain , my feet are most uncomfortable . if i 'd 'a known we was gon na have to walk all the way to ramelle , i never would 'a volunteered for this here mission .
no , three brothers of his were killed in action . command wants him out of there .
senator 's son ?
a paratrooper named ryan . he 's going home , if he 's alive .
that 's general gavin 's . his lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it , i 'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger , i 'll get court marshaled . if you were to take it , they 'd shoot me .
how about that jeep ?
sorry , sir . division is using everything on wheels to get up to caen . how come you guys are n't going ?
a half-track , anything .
no white-walls , sir , there 's a war on . not there , you goddamned idiot , over there ! i ca n't help you , sir .
white-walls ?
sorry , sir , fresh out of trucks , how 'bout a '38 ford roadster , hard-top , red with black interior .
i changed my mind .
captain , what about our deal ?
i teach english at addley high school in addley , pennsylvania .
what 'd you say , captain ?
that 's better , but you 've still got a long way to go . talk to reiben , he 's a natural and works at it , he 'll give you some pointers .
goddamn it , sir ...
there you go again , that 's whining , that 's not okay .
but , sir ...
upham , you 've got to learn the difference between whining and griping . you ca n't just rely on natural ability , you 've got to study and practice .
the germans do .
sure , you got one ?
would they notice and eighty-eight ?
those are tigers , they have six-inch armor , they do n't even notice grenades .
what about our grenades ?
those guns are close .
i can tell what the gunners had for dinner .
you do n't count .
i 'd like to stay , too , captain .
same place we are .
i wonder where they 're going .
plenty .
that only leaves three .
what do they know ? i had nine , but i feel through the ice when i was seven , my brother pulled me out . then i used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in sicily , it was a dud . i figure one on the beaches , one on the cliffs and two getting here .
the men said , nine .
do n't need it , i 'm a cat , i 've got five lives .
good luck , captain .
a machine gun .
what is it ?
thank him and tell him we 're sorry about his loss .
no , but he heard firing , just east , less that a kilometer .
did he see any sign of them ?
five nights ago , he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg . the leg got infected . last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor . the doctor refused to come and when he got back , this is what he found . the krauts must have shown up while he was gone .
i do n't expect to live that long .
if that 's the way you feel , why do n't we wait until it 's up to a thousand .
i 'll tell you what , if i 'm still alive when it hits five-hundred , i 'll let you know and we 'll split the money .
over three-hundred .
where are you from , captain ?
some .
you know classical music ?
it seemed appropriate .
i heard .
i 've been humming it .
yes . do you know sibelius ' fourth symphony , the normandy ?
it looks like a renoir .
you think the rest of us were ?
i was n't made for this .
sarge ?
pass .
upham ?
like i said , it was nothing . do n't bunch up .
but you could have gotten killed and i ...
it was nothing .
sir , i 'm sorry about what happened , i ...
dashes across the street .
on the other side of the street , crouches in a doorway with jackson . upham is a bit in shock , less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him .
glad of it .
that 's not all . there were nine gunners on the eighty-eights , one had a broken heel on his boot , two had bratwurst for supper last night , one of them is named fritz , the other , hans , maybe , i do n't know , it 's hard to tell .
you can tell all that , just by the sound , sire ?
forward ! forward ! now reverse !
i know about bracketing . i read about it . the next one is going to land right on us .
yes , sir .
reiben , i do n't know what i 'd do without you . sarge , keep ryan close to you and alive .
out of the mouth of babes .
uh , oh .
we 're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else .
what are we going to do ?
well , if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo , we might stand a chance , but not against those tanks .
what do you think ?
yes , sir .
sarge , see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable .
but , that 's my personal brand of stupidity , i feel kind of proprietary about it , if you do it again , you 're busted .
you 're welcome , john .
thanks for drawing that machine gun off me .
i 'll do my best .
do n't let yourself get killed , if you do , they might make me give back the medal and then i wo n't be able to lip off to colonels anymore .
i know .
you know wade was the eleventh of the twelve , you 're the last one still alive .
just what i want to do .
no , but if i get any worse , you 'll have to relieve me .
you want me to take over ?
i think you 're right , keith .
john , i 've got to tell you , i think you 're about used up .
that 's the rub . i liked wade . who 's ryan ? if they 're both standing in front of me and i have to shoot one or the other , how do i choose ? look at my hand , there it goes again .
except this time , the mission is a man .
simple , numbers . every time you kill one of your men , you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two , three , ten , a hundred others . we lost , what , thirty-one on the cliffs ? i 'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns . that 's over three hundred men . maybe five hundred . a thousand . then thousand . any number you want . see ? it 's simple . it lets you always choose mission over men .
and how do you bluff yourself ?
not in so many words , but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men do n't have good morale , it 's not worth a damn . so if you 're scared or empty or half-a-step from a section eight , do you tell your men ? of course not . you bluff , you lie .
oh , yeah ?
it could be worse . you know the first thing they teach you at o.c.s. ? lie to your men .
no problem . a pair of deuces ? less ? so what ? i bluff . it used to tear me apart when i 'd get one of my men killed , but what was i supposed to do ? break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do ? of course not , so i bluffed , and after a while , i started to fall for my own bluff . it was great , it made everything so much easier . sarge is that why your hand 's been shaking ?
and what about your own hand ?
she 's the best poker player you ever saw . my father used to go to these saturday night games and lose his shirt . finally , my mother gave him an ultimatum , either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every saturday night . he squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down , she never lost . she could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands . and he bluffs ? he had sixteen levels of bullshit . her eyes , the tone of her voice , her bets , her jokes , the way she sipped her coffee , she was a master . she won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game . every saturday night , my father would lose two , three hundred bucks and she 'd win it all back and then some . and i 'd stand there , glued to her shoulder , from the time i was five years old , watching every hand , every move , studying how she did it . that 's why i 'm such a good officer , i can look at a man 's face and tell you exactly what he 's holding , and if it 's a shit hand , i know just what cards to deal him .
bits and pieces .
you know why i 'm such a good officer ? because of my mother . have i ever told you about her ?
yeah .
yeah , vecchio , i could n't remember his name , he was a good kid , remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze ?
vecchio .
what was the name of that kid at anzio , the one who got his face burned off ?
let 's just find someplace .
you alright ?
snatches the morphine from sarge . quickly and efficiently prepares a second shot . he 's done this before .
hesitates . then drops his sulfa . fumbles in his pack . finds the morphine .
more morphine , hurry up , come on , come on ...
shoves the needle into wade 's neck . thick vein . pumps the morphine straight to wade 's brain . motions impatiently to sarge .
about to pour his sulfa . sees the wound . stops . knows it 's fatal .
pulls wade 's hands from the wound . pours sulfa powder .
rolls to his feet . fire another burst . kills the last of the german riflemen . does n't pause . runs onto the field .
hold your fire !
how about you shut up and take your position ?
how about ... ?
how about you take your position ?
how about i go right , sir ?
yeah ? what rule of thumb is that ?
i 'll be alright .
you may have to find yourself a new line of work , this one does n't seem to agree with you anymore .
no . it comes and goes . it stops when i look at it .
is it getting worse ?
a couple of weeks . it started in portsmouth when they brought us down for loading .
it does n't take this .
makes you feel small , does n't it ?
yup , hell of a mission .
now you 're the one kidding yourself . hell of a mission .
i hope this boy ryan is worth it .
you never know .
you 're kidding yourself .
if we stayed , we could make a difference .
three for three .
command is n't going to let them withdraw and the germans sure as hell are n't going to let them surrender .
nope .
they guys here are n't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up .
and what about you ?
they 're fine . as long as they can gripe , they 'll be alright .
you think they 'll be alright ?
good news ?
nope .
you got me . afraid of bad news ?
since when have things been normal ?
it 's not normal , not reading letters from home .
maybe .
you ever going to open those letters ? miller keeps his eyes on the maps .
tell that to private james ryan . we 've got our orders . let 's go .
he 's right , captain , it might be kind of dangerous for those flyboys .
that 's not what we 're here for .
got it , sir . we gon na go take care of those eighty-eights ?
uh , captain ...
push !
uh , captain ...
yep , hell of a mission .
hell of a mission .
a fucking mess , two maybe three kraut divisions , no fronts , no lines , the drops were completely fouled up , we 've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place , trying to hang on . command says we hold st. mere , but north of that , it 's all krauts . even if ryan 's where he 's supposed to be , he 's more than likely dead .
somebody put the wrong crystals in every one of the hundred-and-first 's radios the night before the drop , not one of them works . we 're going in blind .
we in radio contact with anybody up there ?
now we 've got a straight shot , due north , to ramelle , twenty-six miles , two villages between here and there , st. mere , then bernay . we 'll take the jeep as far as we can , then go on on foot .
i 've got a line on one .
you get a translator , captain ?
twenty minutes ago . miller damn , i 'll go see if i can find another one . you get reiben , jackson and wade , meet me at transport .
what about talbot ?
fresh out .
okay , wade . translators ?
beasley 's dead .
i want reiben on b.a.r ; jackson with his sniper rifle ; beasley , demolition .
simpson ? jesus christ on a fucking pogo stick !
simpson .
what about the company ?
some private up there lost three brothers , got a ticket home .
you ? leading a squad ?
i wish . you and i are taking a squad up to ramelle on a public relations mission .
caen ?
do n't need to , the krauts go that covered .
you tryin ' to get yourself killed ?
worked , did n't it ?
i thought you were my mother .
captain , if your mother saw you do that , she 'd be very upset !
rolls his eyes , takes a breath . scrambles into the gap . the other five right behind .
go !
more tanks ... ryan lot 's of them the fear on their faces turns to resignation . they know that they are dead men . they settle into their positions , and prepare to fire and die .
goddamn it !
knows what that means . he hears the rumble of the tanks .
continues firing . cutting down the advancing germans .
fires a burst . more germans drop .
fires a burst . germans drops .
here they come .
hears the faint distant rumble of the tank . barely has time to react . sees :
that 's not where i am . miller no ? where are you ?
i wonder if his cabin is still available ?
i coach the baseball team , too .
what deal ?
get back to your positions !
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
opens up with the machine gun .
here they come !
cocks his thompson . settles down behind some sandbags .
see to it .
leave him to me , captain , i 'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us .
let 's hope , because we 're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here .
maybe caen .
you 're goddamned right , i give the order . vote ! jesus christ ! listen to me , you little pissant pieces of shit , i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes , is that clear ?
yes , sir , of course , sir , i was merely speaking hypothetically . if this was a voting situation , then the vote would have been unanimous . but of course , it 's not a voting situation , you 're the captain , and you give the orders , sir .
have it your way , captain .
you 're only allowed to shoot at germans , that 's one of the rules .
what if our guys open up , sir ?
i have no fucking idea . here we come . cover me .
on the bridge ! we 're coming in .
looks like they 've been having a hell of a party , here , captain .
looks like tea time , maybe they 're brits .
scans the germans with his binoculars .
that 's a mystery to me .
no , sir .
has anyone ever told you , you 're officer material ?
maybe . but what if he dies on the way back ? you see what i 'm saying , sir ? the best possible situation is , he 's dead , we find his body , more or less intact , we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach , or better yet , we head over to caen and catch up with division .
but we accomplish the mission .
neither do i , sir . c : and this is the worst one , we find ryan and he 's wounded . not only does he not carry my gear , we have to carry his gear . and him .
i do n't like that one .
b : ryan is dead . he 's been blown up by the german equivalent of wade , whose name i know you do n't want me to mention . there 's nothing to find . the biggest piece is the size of a pea . we wander around , looking for him until the germans pick us off , one after another .
except for the last part , that one 's not bad .
well , sir , consider the possibilities . a : ryan is alive . we have to take him back to the beach . knowing you , you do n't let him carry my gear , even though he really should , and we all get killed , trying to keep him alive .
why 's that ?
i 've given this a lot of thought , sir . the best thing that could happen is , we find ryan and he 's dead .
well now i 'm saying we 're moving out . get off your ass .
i thought you said we had an hour , sir ?
up . we 're moving out .
is silent . motionless . he gently closes wade 's eyes . his hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of wades dogtags . he fumbles and drops it . sarge notices .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
we ca n't leave it here .
sir , i 've got an idea , let 's go around .
i 'll make a note of your suggestions but i 'll leave that last one to you , especially if he 's already dead .
yes , sir , as a final note , i 'd like to say , fuck our orders , fuck ramelle , fuck the cheese capital of france and while we 're at it , fuck private james ryan .
any further thoughts on the subject ?
but i am a captain . if i were not a captain , i would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player , which i am , having learned at the side of my mother who is , by popular acclaim , the best poker player in ...
sir , if you were not a captain , i would compliment you , now , for being an excellent liar .
in addition , as i pointed out earlier , i have a fondness for cheese and i hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the ramelle products , when we arrive there , to see if they live up to their excellent reputation . moreover , i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and i 'm more than willing to lay down my life , and the lives of my men , especially you , reiben , to help relieve her suffering . the men thoroughly enjoy the performance .
i 'm sorry , sir , i apologize . but if you were n't a captain , or if i were a major , what would you say ?
reiben , what 's the matter with you ? i do n't gripe to you . i 'm a captain . there 's a chain of command . griping goes one way , up , only up , never down . you gripe to me , i gripe to my superior officers . up , get it ? i do n't gripe to you , i do n't gripe in front of you . how long you been in the army ?
you have orders , too .
well , maybe not the captain , but the rest of us have mothers .
easy for you to say , sir . fucking james ryan , i 'd like to wring his fucking neck .
reiben , there 's a fairly good chance you 're not going to die at all .
i 'd much rather die in caen than ramelle , sir . it 's a personal thing .
never mind , do n't worry , we 'll pick up this kid , high-tail it back to division , everything 'll work out fine .
huh ?
ours is not to reason why .
well , sir , in purely arithmetic terms , since when does six equal one ? what 's the sense in risking six guys to save one ?
sure , what do you want to know ?
captain , could you please explain the math of this mission to me ?
upham , are you sure you 've never been in combat ?
jesus christ , he 's a natural !
stands on the edge of the woods , almost in a trance .
general gavin is going to be very irritated at you , captain .
well , i , for one , like cheese .
i 'm listening , sir .
there 's always a bright side .
sir , you know what ramelle is famous for ? cheese . the rest of the company is going to caen and we 're going to the goddamned cheese capital of france . there is no bright side .
there 's to be a bright side , look for it .
i should be on my way to caen , sir . it 's like beethoven , the guy 's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf . go figure , i mean , who 'd he piss off ? and here i am , the beethoven of ladies foundation garments , one step away from caen , the center of the known lingerie universe and instead , i 'm going to ramelle to save some fucking private who 's probably already dead .
yeah , how so ?
captain , i got ta tell you , the irony of this mission is fucking killing me .
where are you planning on putting private ryan , sir ?
sure , reiben .
captain , can i ask you a question ?
but , sir ...
trust me , you 're the best .
no , i 'm not , kaback is , honest . or what about faulkner ? or that little guy with the glasses ?
sorry , i need a b.a.r . man , you 're the best .
please , sir , you ca n't take me to ramelle , i got ta go to caen , sir , please , i told you , they make caen lingerie there , it 's beautiful , it 's the best there is , it 's ... oh , please , sir ...
strides through the chaos , avoiding the passing vehicles . he sees his men and walks toward them . reiben hurries up to miller , pleading .
stay at it until you get fire control . keep 'em down , wait for the navy .
i do n't think so , captain .
oh , captain , they 'll always make lingerie , it 's one of the three basic needs of man -- food , shelter , silk teddies . miller dream on , private .
there 's a war on , good chance they 're not still making lingerie in caen .
lingerie is my life , sir . my mother 's got a shop in brooklyn , i grew up in it , from the time i could crawl , we carry caen lingerie , it 's the best there is , it 's all i been thinking about since the invasion .
reiben , how the hell do you know so much about lingerie ?
just picture some french number been spending all day , every day , making cream-colored , shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists , what the hell you think she wears at night ?
so , you ever heard of employee discounts ? my uncle sells shoes , gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line , got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen .
do n't worry , we 're the only rangers this side of the continent , we 've got to be first into caen .
sir , what if they send some other company into caen ahead of us while we 're pinned down here ?
sure , meet me at the top , we 'll start the paperwork .
captain , can i put in for a transfer ?
sarge ? he was the best friend i ever had . lem me tell you about sarge ...
and sarge ?
jackson was from west fork , tennessee , he was going to be a preacher , his father and uncles have a traveling ministry out of the back of a stretch hudson .
yeah ?
upham ? good kid , smart , he was writing a book .
upham and jackson , what were they like ?
yes , private .
races through the debris . trailed by bullets .
fires the eighty-eight .
looks at miller , sees him growing weak , starting to sway . he gently tries to move miller aside .
does n't move . he just stares at sarge 's body .
struggling with a pair of germans .
is jumped on by one . upham fires . kills the german .
yes , sir .
you set ? sarge nods .
i wo n't need to sir , it 's already here , behind the barricade so ...
do n't do that again .
no , private , i want you to stay here , keep your head down , do n't do anything brave or stupid .
i 'd like to go , sir .
alright , come with me .
yes , sir .
yeah , yeah . i want you right next to me , no matter where i go , you understand ?
thank you , sir .
i hear you sir , but i 'm not leaving .
the hell you are n't , you 're comin ' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way . you hear me , private ?
this bridge can not be held . the germans have two companies less than three miles from here . they have tanks .
sir , if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up , our guys are going to be sitting ducks .
private . i 'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed is n't going to help .
... for you to blow up , yeah , yeah , we heard that .
hell , i do n't mind this mission , sir , as long as there 's something up at ramelle for ...
we all have , he 's got nine lives , or he 's bulletproof , or some damn thing .
wade 's right , it 's some kind of scientific , magnetic thing , i ca n't explain it , but i 've seen it .
look at upham , you do n't hear him complaining .
you want unpleasant ? just wait , i can do much better than this .
reiben , you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes .
fine , you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned private james ryan can carry my fucking gear .
as i was saying , before i was so rudely interrupted , my grandfather got old , as grandfathers tend to do . he needed someone to take care of him . we move around all the time , going from one mine to another , so we had to put him in a home . nice enough place but kind of depressing . but not for granddad . he just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship , going to tahiti , he had his own cabin , first class , with room service . it just so happened that the weather was always lousy , so he never bothered to go up on deck . happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died .
oh , christ , now we got ta listen to that grandfather thing again .
no , i just happen to take the captain 's advice and look at the bright side of things .
that 's because , as i have pointed out on numerous occasions , you are a happy idiot .
so what ? i 've got three satchel charges , six gammon grenades , a dozen- and-a-half pineapples , and all my regular gear . you do n't hear me complaining .
hey , i got a mother . jackson , you got a mother ?
jesus , reiben , think of the poor bastard 's mother .
captain , he 's fast !
damn fool . sir .
what are we likely to run into ?
i usually like surprises .
yeah ? so ?
lingerie .
frogs ?
i care . do n't you know what caen 's famous for , sarge ?
who cares ?
out of the frying pan , into the fucking latrine .
fertilizer , captain , i think we 're in a cranberry bog .
shit , sir .
what about you , captain ?
i do n't know , i kind of like wade 's idea about the cruise ship . i 've never been to tahiti .
freaked out . trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter . ca n't .
goddamn it ... goddamn it ... goddamn it ...
on guard , glancing back . pissed off .
he 's fast , captain , i saw him .
sir , i ran the 220 in high school .
somebody must know where he 's from , what he did for a living .
we know .
but everybody 's heard of him , he won the congressional medal of honor , he saved a dozen men .
get lost .
so , where are you from ?
shit , that 's nothing , i ran twenty- two flat .
twenty-four-five .
how fast ?
who knows ? it worked .
you think he really believed it ?
it 's easy , it runs in my family , take my grandfather , for example ...
how do you do it ?
since i was nine years old . they got a lot of explosives around mines . me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw . damn , we had fun !
demolition , right ?
we have records . we have proof . i 'm sorry to be the one to have to tell you this , but it 's going to get worse . now , if i were you , i would take that fellowship .
no , no he 's not .
because he 's guilty .
how can you , how can you say that ?
do n't let your father 's business infect your life .
you 're trying to get me to say something , that 's why you 're telling me all of this .
well , take a look around the house . is everything nice , but not too nice ? are there lots of , uh , rugs , pieces of art , stereo equipment , uh , furniture , a lot of things bought with cash ? does he give a lot of gifts ? do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range ?
what 's the profile ?
look , why do n't you check it out for yourself ? see if your father fits the profile .
pardon me ?
we believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings , phoney patients . we 've been investigating him for five years . we believe that when they die , he takes their money .
i 'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that i worked for my entire life . i do n't even care . i met this boy over the summer , and i , i ca n't see him because of this , i ca n't talk to him , i ca n't talk to my father about ... i wore these clothes , i thought , i thought that if i looked right and if i acted right then someone would talk to me . but i look awful and i feel awful , could you , could you please talk to me ? be a little decent .
taking care of people is n't a growth enterprise , mr sims . i hope you write that down in your report , i 'd like your bosses to read it .
why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise ?
that 's right .
hmmm . your income , mr court , has n't changed substantially in seventeen years .
what family ? we never heard from them . i sold her house for them , made them money .
the , uh , cynthia branson estate was worth how much ? because her family ...
and your former wife .
this evening is over .
mr court , be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates ...
just come down to my place of business , for god 's sake . i have people here .
so you refuse to answer my questions ?
speak with my lawyer .
understanding the following rights ...
jesus . what , i live in a palace , right ? i have guests here .
yeah , i do n't want it . um , thank you very much . you 're very kind .
you 're sure ?
keep it .
okay , thanks .
oh yeah , let me give you another card .
i 'm sorry , but they turned down your card .
listen , i do n't know your name , but what are you doing for lunch ?
thanks , i like yours too .
excellent .
i 'll take the whole set .
good for her .
yeah , she won a fellowship .
for going to school ?
no , i 'm not married . it 's for my daughter .
is it a gift for your wife ? are you getting a set together ?
hi .
i 'll be home soon .
lloyd , honey , just come home , okay ?
hello constance . it 's me , lloyd ... nothing , i 'm just driving around ... she broke up with me ... what do i do ? ca n't she come back ? how can i get her back ? ... i ca n't think , talk to me ... i fucked up ... i feel like crying ... she gave me a pen . i gave her my heart and she gave me a pen .
forget it , forget it , it 's mine , it 's mine !
no , no , do n't go in there .
i just washed this shirt , did n't i ?
i 'll be in my office .
he 's a mess !
you 're tough , j-man .
i still am .
yeah .
i was hilarious once , was n't i ?
look , i 'm really sorry that mom and dad made you take me in . really . if it 's such a big deal , i 'll go . but remember this , it used to be fun . it used to be warped , twisted and hilarious , and i mean that in the best possible way , i mean it as a compliment . i mean , i 'm sorry t-i-m left you . but i am not t-i-m .
gee , it 's easy .
jesus christ . i get in a good mood . how hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood , and then be in a good mood ?
why ca n't you be his uncle and not his playmate ?
good thing there 's not a red line on you , j-man . yeah !
because it 's loud enough so the neighbors do n't complain , that 's how come i know .
how do you know how to draw the red line anyway ?
why do you eat that stuff ? there 's no food in your food . not too loud , the red line 's there for a reason .
hey , bad throat , huh j-man ?
i hope you understand .
it 's no problem . i called mom and dad in germany ; it 's like they were there .
i 'm sorry . sam had to do a new crown , we had [ ? ] , and jason had a sore throat . your big graduation , and no one was there .
hey , sis .
lloyd ?
if she wants me , she can come to me .
the world is full of guys . be a man . do n't be a guy .
i am .
no , you 're not a guy .
lloyd , you have to understand her family is being ripped apart . like you and she were ripped apart . like joe and i were ripped apart .
i draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls .
read it .
what does it say ?
i already did .
lloyd , send her flowers , write her a letter . something .
alright .
you 've got to do something special . you 've got to make a statement .
so , what 's your point ?
lloyd , listen to me . everything has changed . you 've had sex . no matter what you might think , nothing will ever be the same between you two . you might be sixty . you might be walking down the street , and you 'll talk to her about something , whatever . but what you 'll really be thinking is 'we had sex ' .
alright , alright , alright , calm down , alright , calm down . nothing 's different .
i admit nothing .
did you sleep with her ?
see you . bye . bye diane .
see you tomorrow .
yes .
hang in there , man .
you are such a great person lloyd . i 'm a good person , but you are a great person .
okay , i got it .
wait for me for when i get round to the front .
please ? corey alright . alright , okay , here .
that 's just so embarrassing .
please ?
c'mon lloyd .
c'mon , just do it .
lloyd .
do me a favor ; take a picture of me with her .
lloyd , give it up .
look at those eyes .
brains stay with brains . the bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques .
sounds great to me , i 'm going to call her , that 's what 's cool about her .
diane court does n't go out with guys like you . she 's a brain .
i 'm gon na call her .
then what 's love ?
going out as friends .
what 's a scam ?
that 's not even a scam .
yes i did- i sat across from her in a mall . we ate together . we ate , that 's eating , sharing an important physical event .
but you never had a first date .
the movies are a good second date , you know , as a date ?
that 's unlikely .
i dream about it .
`` dear diane , i 'll always be there for you , all the love in my heart , lloyd . '' i 've never gotten a letter like this , have you ?
i 've forgotten what i was going to say ... okay , okay , i remember . let him do what he wants .
what ? i 'm sorry , talk .
you know i just sit here listening , and you never let me talk .
and above all , just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever ...
wait a minute .
you 've got to show her respect , you 've got to show her that you 're not like joe ...
wait a minute .
you 're an inspiration lloyd ; you should go on the seven hundred club or something .
look at his face , he did the deed .
lloyd , it 's us .
he 's got that nervous talking thing . i told him not to speak .
i told him to be himself .
meaning that she made the second date a family audition , which is the kiss of death for lloyd .
meaning ?
lloyd is doomed .
i 'm sorry . it 's just you 're a really nice guy , and we do n't want to see you get hurt .
i would n't get my hopes up lloyd .
diane court does not realise how good-looking she is .
trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess .
well , where mr carroll uses the word 'love ' , i look for a new word .
he wants to leave things on a good note .
did you see what mr carroll wrote in my yearbook ? well , he ridiculed me all year long , and then he writes , `` you 're a real live-wire , love mr carroll . '' y'know , it 's all so phoney .
come on , it 's graduation .
i do n't feel anything .
if you were diane court , would you honestly fall for lloyd ?
hey , i know this is a strange thing to say , but maybe diane court really likes lloyd .
what is wrong with this girl ?
it 's too much pressure , it 's not his crowd .
why ?
well , you do n't have to be so dramatic about it .
i just saw joe . he 's here .
i wrote sixty-three songs this year . they 're all about joe , and i 'm going to play every single one of them tonight .
alright .
i 'll put this past my boss
confirm this with my office and my client .
i can put that together .
he 'd like to start serving immediately .
and i want to turn the home over to the state .
i can accept that .
one hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months .
one hundred thousand dollar fine and three months ?
i ca n't give you that . this guy 's been ripping off grandma and grandpa for seventeen years . he 's been getting it from every end . i 'd love to hear his story .
'cause i 'm a guy , i have pride .
lloyd , why do you have to be like this ?
i 'm not going back there . i do n't even know who you 're talking about .
visit her at the home .
look , why do n't you just call diane again ?
that was a mistake . the rain on my car is a baptism . the new me . iceman , power lloyd . my assault on the world begins now . believe in myself , answer to no one ... you probably got it all figured out , corey . if you start out depressed , everything 's kind of a pleasant surprise .
i 'm going to take out diane court again .
lloyd , she 's being difficult .
i do n't know what to say to you , except goodbye .
hi .
hello .
you 're right .
do n't say that , it 's not good for you . you 're ...
i 'm so ashamed dad .
take it easy how mad you make me , i 'm the only dad you 've got .
no , i will . i do n't want to leave something out because i know i can say anything to you . you 're a liar , and a thief .
that 's right , work it out .
no . i told you everything , you lied to me . i would have done anything for you .
why are you being so hateful to me ? is this because of lloyd ?
i trusted you . i stood up in court five years ago and i picked you .
alright , alright . go ahead . when i 'm old , give me someone like me , but go ahead .
you let me believe you . you knew you were guilty , and you let me become a part of it . god , how ... how could you ...
i made their lives better .
no , but you stole from them .
no , you do n't know what it is . it 's not for me . this money 's for you , for when you come back from england with honors to set you up , so you do n't have to depend on anybody again . diane , i take better care of these people than their families do . i care for them , i give them flowers , i feed them , i wipe their mouths ...
yes , i ...
you think you know what this money is ?
you stole from them , you lied to me . how do you think that 's supposed to make me feel ?
honey , about what ?
what am i supposed to think ?
honey , it 's not what you think .
but i found the money .
i swear to god .
swear to god .
honey !
swear to god , i need to know the truth .
sweetheart , no . do n't be ridiculous .
dad , did you do it ? did you take that money ?
what happened to you ?
just finishing up in here .
dad , are you okay in there ?
well then do n't pick it up . you know what 's best .
if i pick it up , we 'll only get back together .
dad , i love him .
'i like him ' ? diane , i 'm talking about being honest with people , being decent ...
dad , in a million years , i would never give him a pen . what 's wrong with having some fun ? i like him .
diane , i 'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy . give him a present , here , let him know you still care . give him this pen .
dad , you and i have talked about this . lloyd and i have talked about this . believe me , this is well-covered territory .
diane , you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments , no strings , because after you get over there , things are going to change . people change .
unbelievable . this is a nightmare .
well listen to me . now , i know you like him , i know he 's nothing like those frat kids you ca n't stand , but honey , after the excitement wears off , then what , huh ? what are you going to talk about ? what do you have in common ? you 're going to be part of an international think-tank , and he 's going to be kicking punching bags .
i like him a lot .
do you love him ?
dad , why are you acting this way ? is this because of the other morning ?
diane ! alright , let 's stop this right now . let 's not put our energy into something ridiculous . this is n't even smart thinking .
you 're not listening to me .
bon voyage .
it does n't feel right to me . i , i do n't even have the right luggage yet .
you 're going .
but listen , if i had a friend in the same position , i would tell her to delay a year .
you 're going .
dad , maybe i should n't go with all that 's happening to you .
dad , no . but i did n't want any problems , so i decided not to sleep with him .
did he ever get rough with you ?
sit down .
dad , yes . and i 'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now .
lloyd ?
i know that .
do you wan na make things easier on me ? now tell me where you were because this is , this is bullshit . you can say anything to me , i hope you still know that .
i 'm fine .
you 've always called before , always . now i 'm not asking what you did , i just want to know that you 're alright .
dad , i 'm so sorry . i know this is a bad time .
you bet you should have called . you still live at home . do n't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning , do n't make me call hospitals .
i was irresponsible , i should have called .
you should be .
dad , i 'm sorry .
morning .
which they did , and every once in a while on a commercial , you can hear me scream .
oh yeah . there was , uh , somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio , and , uh , we got this telephone call , this guy is making a sound effects record , and he 'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream .
so anyway , these two federal marshals meet the plane , and they take our address , and they ask us never to fly with 'friendly skies ' again .
okay , i give up .
which they did . let me finish .
and then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around .
so anyway , they closed the doors , and she starts to scream . i 've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that .
crash paranoia .
i knew how planes flew , but i was still a little nervous .
well , let me start it . i 'm flying down to los angeles on business , and i decide to take her on her first aeroplane .
now why ca n't i tell the story ?
dad .
she 's not the world 's greatest flyer , let me tell you . when she was eight years old , she ...
goodnight .
goodnight .
well , i do n't think he 's really been embarrassed by it .
lloyd was such a gentleman . he was funny and nervous and strange , and i met people that i never would have met before , then i blew it . i called him basic . can you believe i did that ?
wait a minute . how was lloyd ?
dad , i 'm so glad i went . goodnight .
morning honey .
no , listen to me . you 're the best in the country , do n't you understand ? it 's like a pyramid . it starts out with everybody , and it narrows through your life and through everything , and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents . and it 's you . so tell me something , where 's the flaw in that ? there is no flaw .
do n't do this to me . you 're too good at making me nervous .
we 'll worry about that later . now come on , tell me that you 're special .
god , i 'll have to go on a plane .
you 're going to take a big step , a big leap , and before you do , i just want one thing from you , miss . you stand up straight and admit you 're special .
i won ?
you won it . you 're going to study at the finest institute at england , the toughest fellowship in the country , and you won .
are you kidding ? you 're not kidding ? you 're not kidding !
no , no , just listen . you won the wreath fellowship .
tell me , is it bad news ?
i just had a phone call .
what ?
i love you too honey .
i love you dad .
i 'm sorry .
stop it , stop it , stop it .
diane , in a million years , you could never be a ... priss . it 's all working out for you honey , do n't you see ? it 's all working out , just like we planned . all the years of summer school , all the vacations you gave up , it 's all working out just the way we planned ...
everybody thinks i 'm a priss .
no , wait a minute . everybody thinks you 're what ?
i was standing up there and looking at all the people , and i felt like they did n't know me . i mean , maybe i should n't have taken all those courses out of school , because everybody thinks i ... forget it .
they really applauded you today honey .
oh god , i do n't need all these presents . i do n't know any kid who got a car , i mean ...
now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that i kept . now it 's yours . go ahead , open it .
god , that 's ... this is ridiculous .
well , since i 'm not only your father , i 'm also your friend ; i had to get you two presents .
what are you doing ?
okay , i promise i will . just come here a minute , i want to show you something .
dad , you have to teach me to suture this weekend .
well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years , and we 've been through a lot . but with that training out of high school gone , what 's going to happen to us ? we all know what the answers are . we want to be happy , go to college , own a car , maybe raise a family . but what if that does n't happen ? i have , i have to be honest though , i have all the hope and ambition in the world . but when i think about the future , the truth is , i am really ... scared .
ha !
okay .
alright , no more , i 'm going to save it .
oh no , no , it 's ... it 's wonderful . it 's ... no , do n't worry about it . you 're very funny . go back , that 's great !
i did n't think anyone would get it .
oh yeah !
you like it ?
ha ! go back ! what a great line !
having taken a few courses at the university this year , i have glimpsed our future , and all i can say is ... go back .
why ? it 's fine . it 's nice .
well , it 's almost over . we 've gone to school together for three years ... i might cut that part out .
okay . oh , here 's ray . just talk to him because when you do n't , your mouth turns down .
you will ?
alright .
if they ask you questions , and they probably will ask you questions , would you please say something nice about him mum ? help him ?
if we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier . you know , your room is always ready for you , you can always come home if ... alright , what do you want me to do ?
i just wonder what could be more important than what 's going on with dad .
you know , i do n't even know if you 've got a young man in your life ?
this is me telling you about me .
diane , i do have a history with this man , and it 's not the greatest . i see you so seldom , i 'd really rather know about you .
mom , please ?
i know .
no . you just described every great success story . alright , it 's alright .
nobody thought we 'd do this . nobody really thinks it 's going to work , do they ?
how 's it going ?
not right now , thanks .
alright , personalised flight care from corey . books , cassettes , magazines , anything ?
okay .
right , i 'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens , which is going to be soon .
good to know .
so when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding ' , you know everything 's going to be okay .
okay .
alright , high level air safety tips . if anything happens , it 'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight , right ?
okay .
okay , good , this is all very noble .
i 'm fine .
i love you . please , i love you .
one more time would be nice .
i love you . how many more times do i have to say it ?
what ?
i love you .
hurt me again ? not a chance , do n't worry about it .
everything else means nothing to me . if i hurt you again , i 'll die .
you do ?
my father 's guilty . he lied to me , he lied to everybody . i just left home ... i need you .
what do you want ?
i 'm sorry .
what do you want ?
oh shit .
then do n't do it .
do n't be mean , this is hard for me too .
what is that ? what are you doing with your hands ? talk to me , you 're talking like that girl sheila .
lloyd , i love you , okay ?
what , i 'm sorry i said that . forget i said it , it 's what i thought i meant , but forget it .
you have corey and dc . i have my dad .
you told your dad ?
just my dad .
did you tell anybody ?
no , that 's fine . she 'll tell everybody , but that 's fine .
she figured it out . i 'm sorry if that upsets you .
why , did you tell corey what happened ?
did you talk to corey ?
no .
is this because of your dad ?
no i did n't .
you shared it with a dick .
lloyd , we shared the most intimate thing two people can share .
yeah you do .
no , i do n't , i do n't .
i feel like a dick . you must think i 'm a dick .
i think that we should stop going out on dates .
well , if we 're friends , why ca n't we see each other ?
no . we decided that we 're friends . i mean , i know it 's a terrible word ...
it sounded like you did .
no , no .
'cause i 'm worried , did you just break up with me ?
we decided ...
okay , what did we just decide ?
yeah , uh-huh .
okay . it 's good knowing this .
we 'll see .
okay , how much time do you need ? i mean , you know , i mean you 'll be leaving in a little while , so that 's answered some questions .
yeah .
you need to study ?
well , i need to study , and ...
what 's wrong ?
i think that we should spend some time apart .
say what ?
how can i look at you and say this ?
what ? this is a good level , is n't it ?
i know . lloyd , let 's not start putting things on this level .
i was just going to tell you that i love you . i said it .
i do n't know what you 're going to say , but i think that ...
how do you know what i 'm going to say ?
no , we do n't have to say it .
i 've never sent a letter like that , you know ? i mean , i felt like i wanted to tell you something , but i did n't put it in the letter , and i did n't say it , but i want to say it now , i 'm not sure if i should say it , you know , 'cause people always say it and do n't mean it , but i think that i mean it , so , um , i just wanted to tell you ...
it was wonderful .
why did n't you tell me ?
uh-huh . it was wonderful .
it did ?
your letter came yesterday .
check your mail tomorrow . i sent you a letter , a letter .
here are some blankets . this is a good song , this is a really good song .
i do n't know . i 'm happy .
then why are you shaking ?
i do n't think i am .
you 're cold .
i do n't think so .
you 're shaking .
no .
yes . are you shaking ?
are you comfortable ?
yeah .
let 's get outta here . you want to ?
well no , it 's not noble , but it 's a good aid to your lesson .
this is so noble .
now , go into second . little more gas ... yeah ! you can get this whole problem . now , maybe you downshift to first ?
yeah .
little more gas . ease it up . hold on- minor setback . now you feel confident , right ?
oh . i was putting the ...
yeah , a little bit . listen , this is important . when you feel it start to give , put the clutch in .
am i wrecking my car ?
okay , this is important ...
right .
if you 'll just maybe ease it into second .
yeah ?
yeah . now , when you feel like you 're confident , ...
i 'm doing alright .
you know how it 'll come out and feel ... y'know ... little more , little more ... yeah , yeah , that 's right . go round just at first , keep it in first , just feel it .
yeah .
yeah , just keep going first , keep going around . get the feel of it , feel the clutch , when you put it in a little ?
friends with potential .
yeah . with potential .
be friends ?
do n't worry about it . we 're just having coffee . we 'll be anti- social .
i just ca n't have any social life right now .
no .
i just do n't want it to get too heavy . i feel really overloaded . i have this theory of convergence , that good things always happen with bad things . but i know you have to deal with them at the same time , but i just , i mean i do n't know why they have to happen at the same time , i mean , i do n't know why , i just wish i could work out ... am i just babbling ? do you know what i mean ?
it 's okay , everybody does that .
well ... just meet her .
what did you say ?
yes .
wait , wait . you told her about me ?
she 's amazing . she 's ninety-three , she 's a writer , and i told her about you .
okay .
you have to meet bess .
i 'll see you there . bye .
okay , bye .
okay , bye , i will .
stop by later .
really ? um ... i ... well ... you 're really turning me around here ,
i think that 's ageism , and that 's , that 's being prejudiced against people because they 're old . maybe their mouths do n't work as well as yours .
well , except for one thing . i used to work at a smorgasbord , and , and the old people would flock there , and , and they loved to eat . and they just jammed their mouths , you know ? the used to eat with their mouths open , and you know , it 's just too much for me . you get to be thinking about how short life is , and how maybe , maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you 're frying burgers
come on .
me ? sure i do .
i know you think my job is strange . you do n't like old people , do you ?
wo n't you see me later ?
i usually have a break after the dinner service , if you want to stop by .
after work ?
i had a checklist in mind . i thought that if babies were on the plane , the plane could n't crash . but all the babies were crying , and i thought they knew something i did n't .
oh .
mmmm .
you think so ?
i think you should wear that .
yeah ?
nice one .
yeah , i 've had it forever . i used to have this thing with marking the words that i looked up .
boy , this is a mother dictionary .
or , or i could always wear this one .
yeah .
then call me later .
today is tomorrow .
then call me tomorrow .
sixteen weeks is a long time .
i only have something like sixteen weeks .
so am i. i want to see you again . i want to see you as much as i can before you leave . i said it .
no , i 'm serious .
job ? being a great date .
so what 's your job this summer ?
basic . hmmm .
you 're a great date . i 've never really gone out with someone as basic as you .
what ?
you know what ?
twisted ?
thanks . but either way it still feels ...
watch out for that glass .
well , my parents split up when i was thirteen , and ... god , i actually had to ... i went into court and i had to choose between the two of them . so i chose my dad . it just felt safer that way , you know ?
sure i do .
yeah , but that 's an old story , you do n't want to hear it .
it 's just you and your dad , right ?
yeah . i 'm so glad we did this .
that 's cool then .
yeah , but i feel like i fit in for the first time , you know ? like i just held them far away from me , and they did the same to me .
they knew of you . now they know you .
nobody knew me before tonight .
mine say stuff like `` lloyd , see you around maybe ''
alright , this is some of the things they wrote me ; `` glad i finally met you '' , `` you always seemed nice '' , `` wish i could have known you more '' ...
bye .
have a good sleep .
i hereby surrender my duties as keymaster , give me a beer .
thank-you .
it 's the worst job since keymaster .
he does this every year ?
yeah .
so we can finally talk ?
no .
so it 's an honor ?
yeah , i have to judge who can drive home and who ca n't . i have to keep their keys .
keymaster ?
no .
oh . um , would it be terrible if i wanted to go home early ?
they 're bavarian death style pretzels .
what are these ?
yeah
would you hold this for me ?
whoa .
goodbye .
goodbye .
eight . eight o ' clock .

no tips . i wo n't give you any tips of any kind .
well ...
y'know , you 're not in england yet , you know that of course , and by the way , i want to just tell you that i lived in england for a few months ,
actually , i think that i ...
look diane , i 'm sorry , but i ca n't allow you to leave the country without going to valhere 's graduation party . this gentleman , he 's twenty-two , and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion , and he dresses up as the lakeside rooster , and he ,
hmmm ... .
what about tonight then , are you going to that party at valhere 's ?
well , not monumentally .
so you 're monumentally busy ?
saturday , i have some things to do around the house .
are you busy on saturday ?
yeah , i have to help my father .
are you busy on friday ?
yes . things are pretty hectic right now , but thanks .
busy ?
oh , thanks , but i 'm busy .
okay , um , so it 's lloyd and ... uh ... uh ... let 's go out . do you wan na go out ?
no , i read it on the message .
yeah , yeah , yeah . you remember ?
yes , we sat together at bell 's square .
quick question - do you know who i am ?
yeah .
yeah .
yeah . what a day .
whoah , what a day , huh ?
thank you very much .
yeah . i just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to england , and i wanted to tell you that i thought your speech was really incredible .
yeah ?
yeah . i read about your fellowship in the paper , and i 'm very glad you called me back .
hi . you called me ?
no noise , no sound , no movement , nothing ! hello , diane ?
look at those eyes .
thank-you . the real world .
you 've got ta get her out of your head , man .
you 're freaking out here man .
man , you 're bringing me down !
hey man , i was in love once . i got hurt really bad . i never wan na go through that again .
man , you never had a chance with a girl like that .
it 's your castle , man .
your only mistake is that you did n't dump her first . diane court is a showpony . you need a stallion , my friend . walk with us and you walk tall .
man , all you got ta do is find a girl who looks just like her , nail her , and then dump her man , get her off your mind .
work that jab , work that hook , work that jab , okay , take a break , take a break .
pain !
hook up the jab , hook up the jab .
no my brother , you have to go buy your own .
he 's back . hey my brother , can i borrow a copy of your 'hey soul classics ' ?
yeah !
yeah , you got ta go 'yeah ' , strength . poor little man .
yeah .
just knowing a person like that exists , knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . that 's got ta be a good thing , right ? that 's got ta be a good thing .
just her name .
it does , it does if it 's the version signed 'i still ca n't help loving you ' . read that .
she ca n't still be angry at this , it 's got ta get better .
i know this part , keep reading .
`` you ca n't know the horrible disappointment i feel ... ''
i 'm incarcerated , lloyd ! i do n't deserve to lose my daughter over this . i do n't deserve to have you as my go-between . and i ca n't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you .
i 'm the distraction that 's going to england with her sir . are you alright sir ? are you okay ?
you 're not a permanent part of her life . you 're a distraction .
i know . but then i reconsidered . 'cause i figured out what i really wan na do with my life , what i want to do for a living is i wan na be with your daughter . i 'm good at it .
very talented .
i know
she 's very successful .
i know .
well lloyd , i admire you for not hitching a ride . you know , my daughter 's a lot different to you .
am i going ? am i going to england ? i 've thought about this quite a bit , and i 've realised what i probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what i wan na do with my life , do all the stuff that i 've been avoiding in a big way . i mean , diane and i can wait for each other , right ? what 's she gon na ... she 's gon na run off with some english guy ? there 's no way .
are you ?
that 's one of the things i wanted to talk to you about sir .
are you going to england with her lloyd ?
she would n't get out of the car . i brought her all the way here , she said she was going to come here , and she would n't get out of the car . but i thought that is was important , that she come to see you , because i know that if you go somewhere and you do n't deal with your family stuff , then you 're just gon na , she 's gon na , um ...
i just wanted to say that i 've thought about everything , and i 've decided something . i 'm going to give you another chance . maybe no one 's listening , or maybe your father 's listening . mr court , if you 're listening to this , hello , how are you ?
go ahead , pick it up if you want .
hi , lloyd . this is my eighth and final call ...
you mean like career ? uh , i do n't know . i 've , i 've thought about this quite a bit sir , and i 'd have to say considering what 's waiting out there for me , i do n't want to sell anything , buy anything or process anything as a career . i do n't want to sell anything bought or processed , or buy anything sold or processed , or ... process anything sold , bought or processed , or repair anything sold , bought or processed , you know , as a career i do n't want to do that . so , uh , my father 's in the army , he wants me to join , but i ca n't work for that corporation , so what i 've been doing lately is kickboxing , which is really a , uh , new sport , but i think it 's got a good future . as far as career longevity goes , i do n't really know , because , you know , you ca n't really tell . your training sticks as a fighter , you know , but it 's no good , you know , you have to be great , but i ca n't really tell if i 'm great until i 've had a couple of pro fights . but i have n't been knocked out yet . i do n't know , i ca n't figure it all out tonight sir , i 'm going to hang with your daughter .
no , really .
i 'm totally and completely serious .
seriously , lloyd .
spend as much time as possible with diane before she leaves .
yeah lloyd . what are your plans for the future ?
well , we pay for the [ ? ] . that guy did n't want to part with it , a little matter of nine thousand dollars .
how do you pay for one of those ?
thanks lloyd .
yeah . honey ?
how ya doing ? is she around ?
fine lloyd .
hello . heard about that graduation present . really quite a car . look , i know you 're busy , you do n't ' have to retain me , but you can trust me . i 'll tell you a couple of things about myself , i 'm nineteen , been overseas for a couple of semesters , but now i 'm back . i 'm an athlete , so i rarely drink . kickboxing . you heard of kickboxing , sport of the future ? don 'the dragon ' wilson , lenny [ ? ] merciless , one of the champions of the sport ? i can see by your face , no . my point is , you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours .
hello lloyd .
hi . lloyd dobler , sir . pleasure to meet you .
jim court ... no , this is her father . i 'll take ...
okay . good afternoon . goodbye .
yeah , she is . good luck .
she 's really pretty great , is n't she ?
what ?
okay . she 's really pretty great , is n't she ?
okay , i 'll give here the message .
oh . okay then ... lloyd dobler , 555-1342 .
why do n't i just get your phone number , that 's usually how it works .
uh , no , not really , no actually , basically , you do n't know me . i 'm a friend of your daughters ; well i sat with her yesterday at the mall .
the truck ?
no .
the guy with the datsun ?
no .
is this the guy with the mustang ?
uh ... okay ... um ...

hello . may i please speak with diane please ?
jim court ?
dude , i ca n't do it !
diane court .
your car ?
my car .
dude , why do you think i keep her tapes ? they 're going to be valuable some day .
stop freaking with her head man . just stop playing with her mind , you know ? she 's a human being . she 's a person . she 's very talented , you know .
so what 's up ?
joe . joe . she 's written sixty-five songs . they 're all about you . they 're all about pain .
hang tough , lloyd .
how many people really know what they want though ? i mean , a lot of them think that they have to know , right ? but inside , they do n't really know , so , i do n't know . but i know that i do n't know .
lloyd , everybody in that party put something down on their record except you .
we 'll just make an appointment for you at seattle junior college .
my dad 's a lieutenant colonel in the army , he wants me to join , he wants to pull some strings . i mean , there 's no possible way .
do n't make this like a counsel , lloyd . i got statistics i can show you , i got graphs i can show you . that 's all the stuff i can show you , it all says the same thing . you have to decide on a career .
what ?
lloyd .
no way .
you missed every one of your career counselling sessions . call me obsessive , compulsive , but let 's do this right now .
how ya doin ' miss evans ?
lloyd . lloyd dobler , i 've got you .
i do n't really know where we are .
how you doin ' , brother ?
ooop , excuse me .
alright . key ?
this is great , this gives me hope . thanks .
i 'm lloyd dobler .
yeah , but how come it worked ? i mean like , what are you ?
i called her up .
yeah , hey , oh god . listen , i wanted to ... i do n't know you very well , you know , but i wanted to ask you , how did you get diane court to go out with you ?

mike cameron , how you doing ?
hey .

maybe we 'll come by tomorrow , help you clear up or something .
i do n't know . good on you man . alright lloyd .
i do n't know .
you know , every year i throw this party , every year nobody helps me clear up . why am i yelling ?
i was just going to kind of move around .
thanks a lot lloyd .

oh , i was just going to ...
wow , man . well . listen man , i need you to be the keymaster .
you know diane court ?
it 's got ta stay purple . all night . hey lloyd , how ya doin ' ?
i got a question . if you guys know so much about women , how come you 're here at like the gas 'n ' sip on a saturday night completely alone , drinking beers , no women anywhere ?
later for you , luke .
yeah , alright .
we 're full on bonded .
alright , i love you too . go to sleep .
i love you man .
you must chill ! you must chill ! i have hidden your keys . chill !

i love you too .
i love you man
alright !
we finally graduated , big dude guy !
now i 'm back , and you know what i 'm going to do now ? i 'm going to have a good time . so are you .
now you 're back .
things worked out . i made some money over there , had some laughs , you know . it was good .
nothing 's changed . then again , something has changed , has n't it ?
how do you do ? what can i get you , what 're you drinking ?
oskar - my friend lena .
my plant manager is somewhere on this train . if it leaves with him on it , it 'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why .
the gentleman thinks a mistake 's been made .
klaus tauber .
i did n't ask you about the list , i asked you your name .
sir , the list is correct .
what 's your name ?
i 'm talking to a clerk .
he 's on the list . if he were an essential worker , he would not be on the list . he 's on the list . you ca n't have him .
well , let 's find him .
he is .
itzhak stern ? he 's on the list .
he 's essential . without him , everything comes to a grinding halt . if that happens -
it 's up to you .
should i stay ?
it 's a beautiful city .
should i stay ?
i feel like an old-fashioned couple . it feels good .
what ?
war .
luck .
a charade ? how could it be a charade ?
it 's not a charade , all this ?
you would , though . that 's what i 'm saying .
i do n't have to like her just because you do . it does n't work that way .
what -
oskar , please -
you know what , you 'd like her .
breslau ? i ca n't go to breslau . not now .
in breslau .
all right , okay , let 's talk .
i 'd love to , it 'll have to wait until i get back . i have to leave .
there are some things that are unclear . we need to talk .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
your friend amon goeth has been arrested .
the guards are n't allowed on the factory floor . they make my workers nervous .
where are the guards ?
all you have to do is tell me what it 's worth to you . what 's a person worth to you .
yeah , all right , do n't tell me , i 'll go along with it , it 's just irritating to me i ca n't figure it out .
you did , but you did n't .
i just told you .
if you admit to making three , then it 's four , actually . but how ?
yeah , sure .
it 's good for me - i know them , i 'm familiar with them . it 's good for you - you 'll be compensated . it 's good for the army . you know what i 'm going to make ? artillery shells . tank shells . they need that . everybody 's happy .
you 're not telling me something .
look -
oh , this is `` good business '' in your opinion . you 've got to move them , the equipment , everything to czechoslovakia - it does n't make any sense .
it 's good business .
what are you , moses ? what is this ? where 's the money in this ? what 's the scam ?
these people , my people , i want my people .
you want these people .
i do n't know . soon .
when ?
they 're taking mine . when i said they did n't have a future i did n't mean tomorrow . auschwitz .
you took my workers .
i got a shipment of hungarians coming in , i got to make room for them . it 's always something .
what 's going on ?
i tried to call you , i 'm running a little late , this is taking longer than i thought . have a drink .
i want him . come on , let 's go inside , let 's have a good time .
what do you want for him , i 'll give it to you .
he 's important to my business .
you held back stern . you held back the one man most important to my business .
i pay you too much .
it 's true . never happen in cracow , though , we all love you too much .
well , you 've been through it . you know . you could make things easier for me .
do you have any idea what 's involved ? the paperwork alone ? forget you got to build it all , getting the fucking permits , that 's enough to drive you crazy . then the engineers show up . they stand around and they argue about drainage - i 'm telling you , you 'll want to shoot somebody , i 've been through it , i know .
true .
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude . that it 's not some vague thing with you like with some guys .
yeah , what 's that ?
scherner told me something else about you .
some of the boys went crazy , what 're you going to do ? you 're right , it 's bad business , but it 's over with , it 's done . occasionally , sure , okay , you got to make an example . but that 's good business .
it 's bad business .
we 're going to be making so much money , none of this is going to matter -
every day that goes by , i 'm losing money . every worker that is shot , costs me money - i have to get somebody else , i have to train them -
they 're mine !
they 're not gone , they 're here .
i go to work the other day , there 's nobody there . nobody tells me about this , i have to find out , i have to go in , everybody 's gone -
i 'd say i 'd get you one but the guy who made it , he 's probably dead , i do n't know .
he looks great , though , does n't he ? i have to know - where do you get a suit like that ? what is that , silk ? it 's great .
you 're kidding .
you know , they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner .
good .
we started without you .
takes diamonds to stay on this list .
what do i got for you ?
you want to stay on it ? what do you got for me ?
of course i 'm on it .
hey , poldek , how 's it going ? you know about the list ? you 're on it .
yeah , i can .
ghetto police . i 'm a policeman now , can you believe it ?
look it up .
this is not my problem .
i asked for metal , you gave me glass .
so i 'm responsible for the weather ?
my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army . but by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke , the whole truckload .
you asked for shoe polish .
you do n't recognize it ? maybe that 's because it 's not what i asked for .
what 's that ?
you 're a good man .
yeah , okay .
god bless you , sir .
that 's great , thanks .
i work hard for you . i 'll continue to work hard for you .
that 's great .
the ss beat me up . they would have killed me , but i 'm essential to the war effort , thanks to you .
you 're welcome , i 'm sure you 're doing a great job .
i want to thank you , sir , for giving me the opportunity to work .
yeah ? yeah , that 'd be nice , let me get my coat .
i thought maybe you 'd like to come over , have some dinner , some of the people are coming over .
i 've been here . i guess i have n't been out .
i mean where have you been ? nobody 's seen you around for a while .
i 'm having a drink , come on in , we 'll have a drink .
what are you doing ?
things are great , things are great .
good . how 's it going ?
how should i know ? it 's broken . see what you can do .
what 's wrong with it ?
she 's good .
what 's the matter , everything all right at home ? mila 's okay ?
yeah .
how you feeling , all right ?
i do n't know , ten or twelve . that 's a good color . dark blues , grays .
how many ?
nice things cost money .
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs ?
there 's nothing in the stores .
like this ?
pistols , rifles , carbines ... i 'd be grateful .
pistols ?
it kind of looks that way .
we 're losing the war , are n't we .
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate . i 'd like the chance to defend myself . i 'd like my wife to have that chance . my civilian engineers . my secretary .
wine ?
oh , god , you do n't have a drink ?
i need a drink .
thank you .
how do you do ?
are you kidding , i never miss a party . police chief rasch , my wife emilie .
oskar , good of you to come .
did i threaten anybody here ? i stated a simple fact .
he does n't deserve your loyalty . more important , he 's not worth you making threats against us .
he 's got no style , we all know that . so , we should hang him for it ?
he 's a friend of yours , you want to help him out . tell me this , though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation ? i 've yet to see it . never a courtesy . never a thank you note . he forgets my wife at christmas time -
so i 'll talk to him about it .
the place produces nothing . i should n't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army . that 's not all right .
done . lets not talk about it anymore , let 's have a good time .
that 'd be fine .
whoever . they 're the ones . they 'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me .
what others ?
no , look . it 's the others . they 're the ones causing these delays .
i 'd never ask you for money , you know that . i do n't even like talking about it - money , favors - i find it very awkward , it makes me very uncomfortable -
you did so much .
i did n't do enough .
there will be generations because of what you did .
if i 'd made more money ... i threw away so much money , you have no idea . if i 'd just ...
oskar , there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you . look at them .
i could 've got more ... if i 'd just ... i do n't know , if i 'd just ... i could 've got more ...
no , no , what , what is it ?
i 'll talk to you later .
you 'll lose money .
you do n't ? i do . i see a difference .
i know what you 're saying , but i do n't see the difference .
no ?
there 's a rumor you 've been going around miscalibrating the machines . i do n't think that 's a good idea .
well , sure . so would i. so would you . i would n't worry about it . we 'll get it right one of these days .
they 're withholding payment .
well , that 's to be expected . they have to understand . these are start-up problems . this is n't pots and pans , this is a precise business . i 'll write them a letter .
they arrived , can you believe it ?
they arrived .
stern .
we need to talk .
yes .
that 's very generous of you .
give or take what , stern - how many - count them .
eight hundred , give or take .
more .
four hundred , four fifty -
well , i 'll talk to somebody . i 'll take care of it .
i think it 's too late .
i 'll talk to him .
there 's nothing you can do . i 'm not asking you to do anything . you came into my office .
i 'll admit it 's a weakness . i do n't think he enjoys it . all right , he does enjoy it , so what ? what do you expect me to do about it ?
and killing .
you have to understand , goeth 's under enormous pressure . you have to think of it in his situation . he 's got this whole place to run , he 's responsible for everything that goes on here , all these people - he 's got a lot of things to worry about . and he 's got the war . which brings out the worst in people . never the good , always the bad . always the bad . but in normal circumstances , he would n't be like this . he 'd be all right . there 'd be just the good aspects of him . which is a wonderful crook . a guy who loves good food , good wine , the ladies , making money ...
it 's dangerous . it 's dangerous , to me , personally .
what other point is -
no , i 'm not losing money , that 's not the point .
are you losing money ?
you think i do n't know what you 're doing ? you 're so quiet all the time ? i know .
oskar -
i got to go , i 'll see you .
thank you .
this , i do n't know , maybe you can trade it for something .
ah , yes .
christmas presents .
you try to be fair to people , they walk out the door ; i 've never understood that . what 's next ?
do what ?
do n't ever do that to me again .
there 's a machinist outside who 'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job .
what ?
the war could end .
any reason to think next month will be worse ?
yes .
better this month than last ?
yes .
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it 's till hot . we 're doing well ?
but it 's less . it 's less than what i would pay a pole . that 's the point i 'm trying to make . poles cost more .
the jewish worker 's salary , you pay it directly to the ss , not to the worker . he gets nothing .
what was that about the ss , the rate , the ... ?
they should be .
i do n't know anybody who 'd be interested in that .
something they can hold in their hands .
pots and pans .
well , they would n't own it , i 'd own it . i 'd pay them back in product . they can trade it on the black market , do whatever they want , everybody 's happy .
jews can no longer own businesses , sir , that 's why this one 's for sale .
jews , yeah . investors .
the contracts ? that 's the easy part . finding the money to buy the company , that 's hard .
get the contracts and i 'm sure you 'll do very well . in fact the worse things get the better you 'll do . it was a `` pleasure . ''
i think most people right now have other priorities .
once the war ends , forget it , but for now it 's great , you could make a fortune . do n't you think ?
simple engineering , though , would n't you think ? change the machines around , whatever you do , you could make other things , could n't you ?
i was just the accountant .
of course he 's stealing from me , we 're in business together . what is this ? i 'm sitting here , suddenly everybody 's talking like this is something bad . we take from each other , we take from the army , everybody uses everybody , it works out , everybody 's happy .
he 's stealing from you , oskar .
there 's taking money and there 's taking money , you know that . he 's taking money .
what 's he done that 's so bad - take money ? that 's a crime ? come on , what are we here for , to fight a war ? we 're here to make money , all of us .
he was a metal press operator , quite skilled .
a one-armed machinist , oskar ?
no .
would it do any good ?
file a grievance with the economic office , it 's your right .
i lost a day of production . i lost a worker . i expect to be compensated .
it 's got nothing to do with reality , oskar , i know it and you know it , it 's a matter of national priority to these guys . it 's got a ritual significance to them , jews shoveling snow .
that does n't work , sir .
we 're going to bring her in . hide her out for a coupla days . and we 're issuing a campus lock-in this evening . no one is allowed out after dark .
what now ?
no , we got pressure from california state . the man practically has clemency . we ca n't run the risk of falsely accusing him . he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move .
ca n't we hold him ?
37 usages of himbry located in the registar 's office . 9 tatum 's , 47 riley 's . and that 's just on campus . it 's hopeless .
how 's the name search going ?
thanks , dewey , but i was thinking i 'd pull jesse off ...
i can do it , captain .
we 're aware of that .
the killer was trying to get to her . that sorority girl was a distraction .
we know that , son .
on national television .
i would say we are now officially baffled .
broad daylight , a crowded movie theatre . this is too much fun for one person .
you 're sure about this two person thing ?
they 've broken their pattern .
he 's broken his pattern .
find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name ...
jesus christ . captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action .
the first two were stabbed without thought . the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
we do n't know if it 's random . we have n't been able to connect the victims .
take the neighborhood .
attic , garage , basement , nothing .
have you checked the ...
okay , okay . i 'll call now . i 'll call you back .
... campus security ... send someone ... check out ... place ...
i 'm losing you .
hang up ... call ...
what ? i ca n't hear you ...
do n't do that . hang up ... call ...
that 's smart .
outside .
i ca n't believe you 're alone in that house .
stop it ...
kill , kill , kill , kill , hah , hah , hah , hah ...
where ?
i heard a noise .
what is it ?
shit .
it 's hell week . chill . the movie murders have brought out the crazies . it 's nothing .
no , some creep asshole trying to scare me .
alright , alright ... i 'll call you back .
do n't . think bailey .
i wo n't .
that shit . he only calls you when he 's drunk . do n't go over there .
no , he quit - the whole god thing -- he has issues . the previews for next week ...
thought he was doing aa .
no , they broke up again . bailey wo n't stop drinking and sarah ca n't take it anymore .
do n't forget to set the alarm .
whaaaatt ?
no , it 's me .
hello ? ted ?
i 'm impatient . look , do you wan na leave a message for someone ?
i 'm inquisitive .
why do you always answer a question with a question ?
why would you wan na do that ?
what if i said goodbye ?
what if i said you ?
`` drink with your brain . '' that 's our motto . who are you calling for ?
that 's too bad .
i 'm designated driver . i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride .
why are n't you there ?
we 're co-sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep . house tonight .
where is everybody ?
who do you want to speak with ? nobody 's here .
that 's okay .
oh , i 'm sorry . my bad . i thought you were someone else .
ted ? where are you ? are you drinking ? hold on .
someone who wants to talk to you .
cici . who 's this ?
who is this ?
yes .
i 'll go . i do n't mind . really .
tina , it 's dawnie . i 'm on my way . cici follows her back into the living room .
just some asshole trying to scare me .
i had to change . did anyone call ?
i thought you were going to the mixer ?
i live here .
jesus , you scared me . what are you doing here ?
not until youre dead .
its over , cotton .
i get my revenge and make some fast cash .
please , cotton , dont do this .
its perfect , sidney . no one will ever suspect me . i have proof . im the victim .
you 're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother .
what ?
it helped me realize one thing .
did it ?
i just thought if i saw you face to face , maybe it would help .
cotton , there is n't one day , one hour , one minute when i 'm not reminded of what i 've done . i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being . and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i do n't think the words exist .
i wish it was just a year . i lost everything because of you . i have nothing now . look at me , this is what i 've become . a long silence . sidney is hanging on by threads .
how ? what could i say that would make a difference ? i took away a year of your life -- how do i apologize for that ?
you wrote me a letter . very cordial . very appropriate .
i did that .
you could start with an apology .
what do you want from me , cotton ?
look , yesterday was n't my idea . that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings .
i do n't think that 's a good idea .
can we talk ?
cotton .
gale , i do n't know what i 'm doing from one moment to the next . i 'm just taking it as it comes .
do n't do anything stupid , cotton . you 've come to far .
you 've done nothing but get rich off of me . how many books have you sold , gale ? you think i do n't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights ?
cotton , i 've done nothing but help you .
no , gale , i do n't have any rights . you made sure of that .
you have a right to be angry .
now , gale , you were so instrumental in my freedom . you 're not having character doubts now , are you ?
did you do it ?
you know the story , gale . man falsely accused , sent to prison , proved innocent , released back into the real world and never trusted again . want the exclusive ?
enter cotton weary .
but youll never get away with it .
finish what my son started .
what are you going to do ?
where do you think he got it ? mental illness is heriditary . who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother ? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance .
jesus , youre just as whacked as your son .
youre all in this together ?
i couldnt believe you didnt recognize me . you even interviewed me for your book .
look , i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win . okay ? i 'm not interested in the scoop anymore . excuse me .
parents are always responsible . it all starts in the home .
no , i do n't .
already did . he 's the perfect suspect , do n't you think ?
why do n't you ask them ?
and are the police sure about that ?
home -- where he lives .
where is sidney 's father ?
tons and tons .
hi , gale , any leads ?
good for you .
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year .
do i know you ? you look familiar .
and much richer as a result .
well , you know i 'm dear to the subject matter .
what are you doing here ? i thought you had retired from field reporting ?
fair enough .
job hazard . debbie salt , stringer -- newsweek . answer a few questions ?
look , i 'm sorry about the face .
you freakin ?
yeah .
no way .
she dumped me .
where 's sid ?
not one bit .
are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of greek life ?
definitely whitney .
`` and i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all you dreamed of offffff . i wish you joyyy . ''
i think he 's doing dolly .
should we be worried about this guy ? is n't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying ?
i could use some therapy .
i was a sorority slut .
what 's your subject ?
my documentary is due on tuesday .
hey , it 's cool . hallie 's into it , i 'm into hallie ...
how do you put up with this greek shit ?
but nobody wants to see that . itll never go . theyll rewrite you . you dont want that .
yeah , were trying to send a message to hollywood . im really getting tired of all the happy endings . its just not reality . in the real world the good guys die , the innocent are punished , and the murderers inherit the earth .
youre not going to get away with this .
poor cotton , could life be a little more cruel ?
good question . you took the bait .
why ?
thats quick .
no . this is a set up .
go on , untie him .
then i 'll make this easy for you . i like you . i 'm crazy about you , sid . but i 'm gon na stay away . until you say otherwise .
it 's not you , derek . i do n't trust myself . i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men .
i do n't really know what happened in woodsboro , sid . but i know you do n't trust me .
no , it 's not .
i had the four o'clock shift . you were n't there . you had us worried . is everything okay ?
it 's under control .
what about your film ? is n't it due next week ? have you even started it ?
let us decide that .
my screwed up life should n't have to bleed onto my friends .
i think it 's out of your control .
this is exactly what i do n't want .
i 'll get my jacket .
lem me take you home .
the forbidden subject .
about what ?
i 'm sorry honey . i got behind .
where have you been ' ? you missed my shining moment . i won the macaroni sundae binge .
sid , you do n't have to .
it 's okay . i can peddle toilet paper .
do n't ask what you can do . no coddling . life rolls on status quo .
i 'm sorry , baby . what can i do ' ?
i skipped . too many `` that 's her '' looks .
how are you ? you were n't in class . i called as soon as i heard ...
tuitions expensive .
we had to have financing .
tails .
oh yeah . we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press . its been an ongoing discussion . heads or tails ?
wait a sec , derek . we forgot to flip .
just for you , sid .
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings .
or it found us .
so we found a compromise .
and we didnt want to do that , sid . we wanted to give you your moneys worth .
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience ...
yeah , we really had our work cut out for us . it really is the curse of the sequel . the billy/stu things been done .
a twist ending if you will .
hope youre ready , sid . we got one last surprise for you .
and now , drum roll please ...
were hoping for the death penalty . i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned .
a verdict and premiere all on the same day . i love it .
the way i see it . well be arrested . go to prison . cash in on the home footage . secure a book deal . if all goes as planned , our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii .
of course not . who wants to ? whats the point if we dont get caught ? wheres the glamour in that ?
until now .
youre the one who got away .
youd me amazed at how many of us there are out there . its a whole world , sid . youre really popular amongst the demented .
we have our own website now . we dedicated a whole page to you .
i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly . hook , line ...
he sent me the cutest e-mail .
i find his work overwrought .
he hates oliver stone .
i really dont like that comparison , honey .
ever see natural born killers ? well , derek and i have this whole mickey/mallory-woody harrelson/juliette lewis thing going on .
yeah , how can we help ? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life ?
yeah , you look quizzical yet pensive .
i got it..
need some help , honey .
are n't most serial killers seemingly harmless ?
he seemed harmless .
randy somebody .
what guy ?
she 's got guards with her .
i did n't say she was alone . that guy -- from her home town showed up . they went off together .
you were n't supposed to leave her alone .
damned if i know . she ditched me .
where 's sid ?
and watch her til 8:00 -- i 've got to edit .
so you 'll relieve me at 2:30 ...
two .
there 's nothing . i 'm coming down .
dewey ?
no , wait here .
let 's go .
he filmed his victims .
jesus christ !
c'mon . let 's go .
maybe they never got here . he could have taken her anywhere .
over here .
this is all too familiar .
let 's find out .
ssshh ! what was that ?
hallie ?
shit ! it 's both of them . the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro . but they 've moved on- -they 're getting closer to sidney . they 're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill . they 're looking for the new tatum .
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision .
and joel 's pre-med .
they 're roomates .
we 'd break some furniture .
..and as lonely as i am ...
maybe not . but think about the sex . as frustrated as i am ...
dewey , you and i would never make it .
and it 's sexier in the dark .
that 's not the way it 's done .
can we turn the light on ?
a bloody knife . a ghost mask . something like that ?
what are we looking for ?
you broke my heart .
billy had alibis too .
solid alibis . he was with sidney when she was attacked .
he 's already got ta be a part of sid 's life . what do you know about this derek ?
meaning ?
if you were truly a copycat , would n't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could ?
not good .
not good . how you doin ?
i also know that you 're an aging tv reporter slash writer who , despite huge tabloid success , has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner . a coupla failed relationships with -- i 'm guessing balding , older men -- have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone . but i bet sometimes , late at night , when you 're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled .
yeah ?
i know that .
and deep down i 'm a good person ? make no mistake , dewey , i 'm a shit .
i think you 're all an act .
you 're a hard one to figure out . gale it 's that complex yet shallow quality . it 's deliberate .
mood swing . i 'm manic depressive .
so what made you change your mind about sidney ?
no , i 'm the one who 's sorry . i misjudged you . now if you 'll excuse me , i have some oozing to do .
i 'm sorry . i do n't know what else to say except i 'm sorry .
how do you know my dim-witted inexperience is n't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people 's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation ?
i never meant to imply ...
page 41 . `` deputy dewey oozed with inexperience . ''
you have every right to be upset .
no , what you are is a money hungry , fame- seeking liar and -- forgive me for saying -- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be .
oh dewey , i 'm sorry .
page 32 . `` deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence . '' i think you 've explained yourself .
and an explanation is , of course , out of the question .
yes , i do retain reading skills . shock .
i see you read the book .
yes , miss weathers , your name is embedded clearly between my ears .
i 'm on crowd patrol , miss weathers , excuse me .
i 've been trying to reach you but you have n't returned ...
miss weathers .
hello , dwight .
whatever .
hey , i got stuff to do . but i 'll find you later , okay .
humor me , sid .
dewey , there 's no such place .
the police are waiting outside . they 're going to take you somewhere safe .
no . this is nothing , dewey . i 'll be okay . go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence .
just in case ...
dewey , i 'm completely equipped with mace , alarm whistle , keyring , knife , a degree in defensive combat ...
do n't worry ...
you go , it 's all stairs , i can take it from here .
no . i will not crawl under a rock . this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time . i 'll just get used to it .
look , sid , why do n't you take off ? disappear for a few days . i 'll come with you .
yeah , right .
as of now , they do n't see any relation . but they 're checking it out . the state , special task force , fbi -- they 're all here . they 'll find the guy .
it 's a copycat killer i knew this would happen . that fucking movie .
they do n't know . it was carefully planned . earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie .
oh my god . how could it happen ?
they thought it was a publicity stunt .
three hundred people watched ? nobody did anything ?
watch your back .
no , wait ...
no , gale , i 'm just getting started . seeya soon .
you 're getting obvious .
you are writing another book , are n't you ? that 's why you 're here . the story 's not over .
what do you mean ?
it 's what you want from me .
what do you want from me ?
stay away from the cop .
oh -- a god complex
i 'm everywhere .
where are you ?
you 're pretty when you 're angry .
what do you want ?
what if your life depended on it ?
i do n't play games .
that 's not the way we play the game .
who are you ?
i 'll give you one guess .
who is this ?
oh my god .
what ?
but who would operate your camera ?
sid , i 'll come with you .
my morn was a delta .
it 's good to see you involved .
it 's hell week . i 'm pledging the deltas .
it seems to be causing a stir . what 's with the toilet paper ?
yeah , well ... you are the definition of mixed emotions . i really should hate you ... i see your movie 's getting good reviews .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm okay . people magazine wo n't stop calling but other than that ...
sidney . hello . how are you ?
the safety what ? fuck that !
stay under the safety light . help is on its way .
i dont know .
where is your attacker ?
yes , goddammit !
are you in danger now ?
someones trying to kill me . i need the police .
but i love you . and i want the whole world to know it .
you 're going to get it . you know what happens .
`` and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you . ''
do n't do this .
`` if i should stay . i would only be in your way . so i 'll go . and yet , i know , i 'll think of you each step of the way ...
what ?
i got a surprise for you .
is sid in therapy ?
he tried to kill her first .
too bad .
sig ep 's got ta band , tonight .
shut up . mickey , you and i can take her late evening .
i have to watch rehearsal .
i have rehearsal .
i got . i got it . friday the 13th , part 20 .
lucas and his romper room stage .
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
oh , sid , youre sounding desparate . i guess fearing death makes one anxious .
it 's not a good idea , hallie .
i 'm the only one who can cut him down .
no , hallie , i 'm not gon na take you down too . i 'll be alright .
can i come with her ?
i 'd really just like to be alone .
it 's okay to break , girl . you shatter if you have to .
no , no , i had n't planned on going , it 's just mickey will be pissed .
no , hallie , not tonight . parties and mass murderers do n't go together . trust me .
we 're missing the sig ep party .
i 've got my entourage . take a break . please .
no , girletta , i do n't leave your side .
it 's okay . look , hallie , i 'll meet you outside .
who is that guy ?
yeah , right .
that was good .
i 'll cover you through rehearsal . derek when do you get outta docu- drama ?
got ta .
what about rehearsal ?
please , i have the perfect excuse .
okay , you 're sure about skipping calculas ?
nah ... i think it 'll die off . it 's opening weekend . let 's see how it goes .
time to change numbers again ?
hello ? hello ?
knock yourself out .
the knife slices into maureen again ... then again . the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife . a horrifying , sickening sight .
the young girl is slashed again .
popcorn flies as maureen falls forward , into the aisle , clutching her bloody stomach . she 's speechless , unable to scream . she holds her bloody hand out for all to see , begging for help . she stumbles down the aisle . someone yells `` sit down . '' maureen turns to several people who begin to react . she turns behind her to see the ghost face coming at her again ... knife raised .
the young girl , clutching her bloody chest ... drags herself , crawling across wet grass ... the killer behind her ... raising his knife again .
maureen looks at phil , confused ... as if seeing for the first time ... it 's not phil . she pulls away when , the ghost-masked figure grabs her with one hand , the other one clutching the hunting knife . maureen sees it , her mouth billowing forth a loud scream that is matched by the entire audience as they scream at the screen .
the ghost advances on the young girl , grabbing her , pulling her to him , raising high a long , hunting knife . the young girl is helpless ...
everyone in the theater is screaming . maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie . she eats her popcorn .
the young girl runs by a window . she looks in . a ghost masked killer stares back . the figure crashes through the window attacking her . she fights him off , getting away , running ...
the crowd is really with the movie . some even talk to the screen . `` you dumb bitch . get out of the house . '' etc .
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door . the young girl in the movie tears off running , screaming , flying through the room .
it 's documented . most serial killers are attractive -- slightly off white males in their twenties .
easy black boy .
and white .
no , she killed her boyfriend . randy was a friend . mickey watch out , derek .
her old boyfriend ?
randy meeks . he was with sid that night in woodsboro .
is that cool ? just to leave her like that ?
i 've been waiting for you , baby .
i counted four .
how many guys they have on you ?
but ...
sid , i 'll seeya tonight .
guys , guys , i 'm sorry but , no way .
perfect . i 'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite .
thanks , joel .
i 'll stop by the deltas tonight .
you 're not allowed to ask that .
i got ta hit the library . anatomy . some of us have real majors . you gon na be okay , sid ?
this has nothing to do with me , joel . there 's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time . i ca n't control that . who 's hungry ?
have they questioned you yet , sid ?
i just love being a sister .
..harmonica style is okay .
..it 's really about family and tradition ...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex .
it 's all about sisterhood . everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but ...
we 've set you each at a five dollar quota .
ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece .
..this week 's tke kegger ...
gee , let me think . `` do you want to ... '' is that the best you can do ? some tired hand me down rehash ? hey , pal , no one 's gon na write a book about you . no movie rights . nothing . i 've been through this before and much better i might add .
do you want to die ?
closer than you think .
showgirls . absolutely frightening . what 's yours ? wait , let me guess . the house on sorority row ? final exam . graduation day ? the dorm that dripped blood ? splatter university ? am i close ?
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
what do you care ? let 'em have their fun . so , what 's up ?
but she 's standing right next to you .
she 's not here right now .
gale ?
hello ?
sandra started without us . we can stay . he kisses her again , then breaks away .
we can still sandra bullock it .
i just have a hard time with insipid , sexist violence .
you got ta go with it . scary movies are great foreplay .
i get scared really easy , okay .
come on , baby . lighten up a little , will ya ?
you are so not funny .
i 'm sorry , i 'm sorry but i had to . it was too easy .
you ass .
i 'm gon na pee . you want anything ?
shush .
why does n't she just hang up and call the police ? stupid..
sssshhh . on screen the phone rings . the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook . she grabs it , running from the bathroom , into the living room , grabbing the phone .
now why does she have to be naked ? how does that serve the plot ?
now .
but ...
take it off .
we got free tickets .
if we hurry , we can still catch the sandra bullock movie .
it 'll be okay , baby , i 'll hold your hand .
i hate scary movies .
do n't panic .
what was that ?
where you going ?
i 'll be right back .
he 's after me .
what are you talking about ?
listen to me . we 've got to get help . the killer 's here .
sid ? jesus , where 's hallie ? i 've been here all night .
anytime . sorry it sucked . it just had that been there done that feeling .
thanks for the movie , randy .
i got ta coupla of those buttons myself .
i have this button i press . see ? it insulates me . she mimes an air lock valve .
i 'll relay it . you sure you do n't wan na go home ?
i guess gale 's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive .
if he 's innocent he 'll have an alibi .
me , too . randy . me too .
well , yeah ... she gave me a job . freelance . it got me outta woodsboro . i 'm sorry about cotton and yesterday . it was a bad idea . i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea . ah , shit , sid , i 'm fucked up . sidney looks at him long and hard , a smile slowly appearing .
do you work for her now ?
i 'm sorry , sid , please . i never should have gone along with gale . i know i 'm stupid . i wish i had some good reason to give you but i 'm just stupid . please , sid , do n't be mad at me .
what do you want ?
no , the other one . the one who played his wife .
melinda mcgraw ?
there 's always someone out there stalking actors . look at that woman from the commish .
and that cici chick was n't that bad either but i 'm really concerned about my safety now .
oh that 's right . those poor poor people . god ben damon was such a hottie .
nah i think it 's doing so damn well because one of it 's players got iced . i just hope none of us end up dead .
i think jeff bridges is getting tired .
heh heh i bet they are babe . i bet they are . look , my battery 's dying . . .
i did . hon , although i got a total of six minutes screen time , they 're the best six minutes of the movie .
oh i would n't miss it for the world . i bet you did such a great job .
all i 'm saying is i 'm gon na be royally p.o . 'd if you do n't catch my acting debut .
look , i 'm stuck on the freeway . i think there was some big accident . it could be a little while so i do n't want you to start freaking if i do n't get there at exactly , eight thirty .
no , jennifer love hewitt . of course it 's me , silly . and i feel like an ass standing in this theater lobby all by myself . where are you babe , the movie starts in twenty minutes .
reaction to what ?
to see your reaction .
alright i 'm here . what the fuck do you want from me ?
closer than you think .
where are you ?
very good . you follow directions well . now for the final part of the game . put down the bat and approach the sign , slowly .
yeah .
no ! you listen to me , if you 're not where i want you in fifteen minutes i 'll hollow her out . do you understand ?
i swear to god if you lay one hand on her !
you 're not playing by the rules ben . do n't you want her to live ?
good bye ben .
what ? !
that 's right . and you beat round 1. now we 're taking the game to a whole new level . meet me beneath the hollywood sign in ten minutes . i 'll have your girlfriend . we 'll be waiting .
what ? ! but i did everything you said to do !
very good . now we play round 2 .
it 's cici ! cici 's the name of the character she plays in the movie !
maybe so , but right now , we play the game . first question , your girlfriend 's counting on you , name your girlfriend 's character in stab 2 ?
i swear to god if you lay a finger on her i 'll fucking kill you !
you seem to be familiar with the stab movies . here 's how we play . i ask you a question . you get it right , your girlfriend lives . you answer wrong , she dies .
what kind of a game ?
more of a game really .
listen you sick fuck , is this your idea of a joke ?
i mean , i 'm standing right outside the ladies room door at the plaza theater . your girlfriend christine is in there . she 's all alone . everyone 's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start . i 've got my knife .
what do you mean ?
now let 's see you act your way out of this one .
thanks .
really ? you 're such a talented actor .
well ya got me . that 's me . i 'm ben damon .
you almost sound like that guy from there 's something about carrie . ben . ben damon .
but your voice sounds so familiar .
asshole , ca n't talk .
wait , wait . do n't hang up .
uh-huh . look bro , my battery is running out . really wish i could chat , but i ca n't so , later .
do i ?
i think you got the wrong number , buddy .
i do n't know .
well what number are you trying to reach ?
who is this ?
who is this ?
hello .
jesus . hello ?
horror flicks . b-movies from milton 's heyday .
what are these movies ? 'amazombies ' , 'space psychos ' 'creatures from thesan andreas fault ' ?
well you 'll find neither . rina reynolds , however , you will .
it may be maureen reynolds --
i know every face in here , respect for the unknown actor i suppose , myself included . if you 're looking for maureen prescott --
well if you wo n't work for me , will you work for the president ?
listen , i 'm busy . nobody has access to those files except studio execs . can you please go away now ?
well can you tell me if the woman in this picture looks familiar to you .
nope .
does the name maureen prescott sound familiar to you ?
i do n't watch tv and i hate books . whatta you need ?
i 'm gale weathers , author of the woodsboro and windsor college murders , and anchorwoman for total entertainment . maybe you 've heard of me ?
can i help you ?
alright , calm down . i 'm going to radio in for backup right now .
he killed milton ! the killer 's inside there ! oh god ! dewey ! dewey 's in there too ! he needs medical help ! he 's hurt !
jesus gale what happened ?
wrong , this issue is sidney prescott ! and either mr. riley is going to obstruct justice or is going to put me in touch with her . so , where is she ?
boys , boys , why do n't we compare our gun calibers later ? the issue is maureen prescott !
actually , there was more this time . this time , we found a picture too .
ok , look . we all know that this has something to do with 'stab 3 ' . what we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about maureen prescott .
ben damon . christine perkins . sarah darling . tom prinze . that 's four , last time i learned how to count .
four ? there are five .
yeah , but , if i 'm not mistaken , you said in your book that sidney got it wrong before . she accused cotton weary of murdering her mother , and he was sent away for it ! maybe there is a third killer . sidney might know something
but we know who killed maureen prescott , billy loomis and stu macher . i mean , they even told sidney how they did it !
whoever it is , now is taking credit for maureen prescott 's murder .
deal , but i 'm still detective kincaid , ok ?
please , call me gale .
in my fifteen years as a homicide detective i 've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are miss weathers .
but you wo n't . you 're a good man detective . we think alike . i know you need my help . and i know you know i need your help .
i 'm not at liberty to tell you that miss weathers . you 're no longer working with the l.a.p.d . i do n't even know why you 're standing in here right now . by all means i should have you thrown out .
who ?
yes well we have a suspect , so do n't get that worried .
shit . sarah darling . i interviewed her too . god , it 's happening again is n't it detective ?
that 's stab 3 , miss weathers . it looks like we 're going to be getting a warrant to speak with miss prescott anyway .
look , miss weathers , if there 's a problem , give me a call . here 's my card . i 'm always there .
oh . i thought you wanted me to stick around .
i go to the police station and do my job , and you go back to being gale weathers .
alright kincaid , no where to ?
and who would that be ?
i 'd love to help , really i would n't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath , but i honestly do n't know where sidney is . after windsor she dropped off the face of the earth . the only other person that might know is , , not going to talk .
i 've tried to get in touch with sidney prescott , but she 's keeping herself very well hidden . you 're my one and only hope in finding her . her life may be in grave danger .
there 's more .
that 's sidney prescott 's mother .
a note ?
i wish that was all miss weathers , but there 's more . the killer left a note .
so is that why you 're here ? is that why you 're holding me from my show , to tell me about some brutal homicide i 'm not even involved in ?
both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the hollywood sign . autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the stab films .
well i interviewed damon once for the show . he was a real obnoxious fuck . any way , the second one , christine perkins , she had a part in stab 2 , did n't she ? she was playing cici .
i 'm sorry miss weathers . allow me to introduce myself , mark kincaid , l.a.p.d . are you familiar with the actor ben damon , or the actress christine perkins ?
jesus christ you scared the shit out of me .
catch him , or kill him .
oh yeah , how ?
because , that means that we 're dealing with an ordinary , flesh and blood killer . and i know how to handle guys like that .
how is that good news ?
here 's the deal , i 'm off to search the soundstage . that 's good news .
i used to think i had the perfect mom , perfect family . till i found out i was wrong . she had a secret life , and i tried to understand that , and soon as i thought i had , more secrets . i do n't ' know who my mom was . sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about my mother for the first time . you know , with tv and those movies and what not . god sometimes i feel like i 'm just learning about myself for the first time . like i 'm watching my life instead of living in it .
what did you know about your mother ?
hmm .
ca n't arrest ghosts . but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people . you 're here , you 're not hiding , you 've done the right thing , miss prescott .
ghosts are tough , you ca n't shoot ghosts .
i know what it 's like to see ghosts that do n't go away . to be watching a scary movie in your head , whether you want to or not , watching it alone .
what do you mean ?
i 'm a homicide detective , remember ? when you see what i see day in and day out , the violence that people do to each other , you get haunted . i think you know about that .
excuse me ?
to me hollywood is about death .
must be exciting , beautiful place , beautiful people .
no , they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business . i grew up here , and i know my way around the studios .
did you request this case ?
all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one , all bets are off .
i 'll call you mark when you catch the killer , detective .
call me mark , would you ? cause i 'm gon na keep calling you sidney .
you seem to like movies , detective .
you mean like , movie trilogies ?
what do you know about trilogies ?
absolutely .
are you sure ?
why did n't you tell me ? this is my mother , dewey . why did n't you say something ?
the killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder , sidney . recently he 's also left a photo of your mother .
sid , get in my car . you 're coming back to the station with me where it 's safe .
and what made you think it was sidney ?
jesus christ sidney , what happened ? i got a call on my cell from home . they told me that someone was attacked .
no .
he could 've monitored the calls on a scanner . did you call her from the set ?
sidney , do you have any idea how he could 've gotten your number ?
what ? when ?
the killer called her .
nice to finally meet you , sidney .
there 's someone here who wants to help .
what rielly ?
detective kincaid ?
is that a threat ?
when it 's a threat , you 'll know it .
is that a threat , detective ?
well sid 's dad could n't help you and he was married to maureen .
who knows more about maureen prescott than her own daughter ?
what does this have to do with sid ?
before you jump to conclusions , the man in the picture , cotton weary , is out of the country on business . his alibi checks out . seems he 's got a tv show in australia , 100 % cotton . it 's supposedly the biggest thing down under since yahoo serious , but that 's besides the point .
police are still searching through the debris . could be days before we find her . . . that is , if she 's even there .
what about angelina tyler ? she was there too .
that is for me to decide . i need to talk to her mr. riley , she is a key element in this case . i have a press conference in an hour , and i need to explain why there are four dead celebrities .
i told you , i do n't know where sidney is . and even if there was a third killer , sidney does n't know about it .
understood . if you 'll excuse me detective . gale .
that 's fine mr. rielly , but if anyone else should die , i 'm going to have to get a warrant .
yeah . a real tragedy .
mr. rielly ? my name is mark kincaid . i 'm with the l.a.p.d . are you aware of last night 's events ?
he was n't superhuman dewey . he was n't superhuman at all .
watch out sid . randy said the killer 's always superhuman .
dewey ! it 's gale !
do n't worry sid i 'd never leave you like that .
dewey my god i thought you were dead .
sid i want you to stay here ! i 'll be right back ! i 'm not gon na let them get gale !
they 've got her !
where 's gale ?
i 'm out back . tied up . hurry sid ! the killer 's looking for you ! quick untie me !
where are you dewey ?
sid i can see you !
dewey ? ! ohmigod ! where are you ? !
help me sid ! the killer 's got me !
yeah ?
jesus christ dewey help me ! they tried to kill me in the bathroom ! the killers !
do n't worry , i 've got a permit for it .
no i 'll be ok. i 've got my mace . my knife . these two lethal weapons .
do you want me to come with you sid ? i mean , remember what randy said ?
listen dewey i have to go to the bathroom .
no .
i can see nothing 's changed .
she was randy 's only girlfriend . . . ever .
karen colcheck . from woodsboro .
mm , what a waste of silicone . what does my mother have to do with this all dewey ? we 're a long way from woodsboro .
alright sid , over there is the stab 3 production offices . that 's where sarah darling was murdered last night .
listen , detective , i wan na see this studio where all this shit 's going down .
i was afraid they were bait , something to , ya know , trick you out of hiding .
follow me .
i figured i 'd be safe if i was at least up here with the people i care about . now where 's this kincaid guy the news is talking about ? i found this place from a fox 5 tv news report . heh .
what ?
well it 's not safe for me up there either . the killer found me dewey . he called me last night .
what are you doing here ? i told you to stay hidden ! it 's not safe for you up here .
sure , why not . you did save my life , mr . rielly .
gale , i know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again . the whole relationship thing .
who is it ?
paternity test results . christ dewey , you 're never going to believe who milton 's kid is .
nevermind , what 'd you two find ?
sidney , what happened ?
i work better alone . why do n't you do some snooping around the set ?
do you want us to come with you ?
i 've got an idea , i 'll hook up with you guys later .
just jennifer . and you .
has anyone else every used your phone ?
oh . yeah , i guess i do .
do you have her number stored in your memory ? phone memory !
sid , this is detective kincaid .
thank you .
gale behind you !
what ?
oh . oh god . gale --
amen boy scout , now answer the fucking door !
do n't worry . i 'm prepared for anything .
fuck !
gale , your engine 's still running .
neither are you , magnum p.i .
you 're not a detective .
i happen to work for the police god dammit !
stop following me .
i 'm on duty .
jennifer ? ! wait , where are you going off to ?
jennifer needs me .
and who is that ?
i 've got my suspicions but still , nothing you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person .
right . sorry . do you think he did it ?
what part of 'off the record ' do n't you understand ?
i 'm sorry , this is too good !
i already removed it . i think someone on the film was trying to find sid , and that 's the only reason i came here . to make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything .
someone stole sid 's file ?
the boys said no . she would n't give her name . a month later , the station gets broken into , the file room ransacked .
and ?
two months ago , the woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'stab 3 ' . she wanted to see the file on sid , for research .
always .
off the record .
all of what dewey ? you do know something , do n't you ?
brace yourself , gale , all of this is actually not about you .
dewey , you 're not just here because of that second rate k-mart , straight-to-video version of me , are you ?
you used to say that was our strength .
it did n't work dewey . we tried , we 're different .
what 's wrong with just being gale weathers ? i liked her !
it was fucking '60 minutes ii ' ! i could n't say no ! i could 've been the next diane sawyer !
so it 's off to london for a week ? new york for a month ? l.a forever ?
you said you 'd never leave woodsboro , 'the only place that 's real ! ' but now you 're here . not with me . dewey , i took care of you . i waited until you were well . i could n't stay there , i mean , it 's like dog years , one year in woodsboro is like seven everywhere else .
what about me ?
again , i am the author of the definitive book on the woodsboro murders. ! what about you ?
why would the police come to you ?
yes . look , let 's get something straight dewey , i got into this shit cause the police came looking for me . not cause i 'm out to make the sunrise studios slashings .
do you really mean it this time gale ?
this has everything to do with me dewey . i was the one who brought the nation 's attention to this shit anyway . i 'll be damned if i 'm gon na sit around and pass on the buck again .
you mean our past as in me and sid . this has nothing to do with you gale .
uh-huh . another news clipping . another one about sid 's mom . dewey , whether we like it or not it looks like we 're going to have to go back into our past .
they found another note ?
show him .
what so you can just exploit her again with another book ? sid does n't need you gale .
dewey , personal lives and pasts aside , this is about sidney . we need to know where she is .
when we did the first 'stab '' i realized i 'd known maureen prescott before , i mean as rina . i could n't tell anyone . can you imagine the press ?
but you know who she was .
what the hell are you guys getting at ? i make horror films , that 's what i do . the studio came to me with 'stab ' . they came to me , check it out .
i remember her ! she was a bit player in a couple of my movies . a nobody ! so what does it matter ?
no point , i 'm just gon na give detective kincaid a call .
what 's your point ?
just what the hell do you people think you 're doing , barging in here like this ? i 've got important calls to make . i run this studio .
so you knew sidney prescott 's mother .
sure .
would you excuse me for a moment ?
well if you were in my shoes , dealing with those big time sunrise studio producers like i do on a daily basis , you 'd watch how quick your life goes from a walt disney picture to a tobe hooper flick .
your life ?
honestly , my life .
roman , from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way . honestly though , tell us , what's your favorite scary movie ?
well it 's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre . and i must say that any of you worried that jerry rapp , or tori or david not returning to complete the stab trilogy , have no fear , roman is here . aided with my excellent cast of newcomers i believe we 're going to pull off one of the best stabs yet .
it 's a pleasure to finally meet you , roman .
good morning gale . pleasure to be here .
do you get any of my witty humor ? i mean , you did play me for three movies . his two hands , dingus .
rob reiner and quentin tarentino ?
milton 's not a killer . he 's a pervert . he probably went out to buy more ky jelly for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends .
i think milton 's the killer . i think he just went out to kill another cast member .
settle down beavis . why do n't you tell us the truth ?
oh , come on ! you have made millions off the story of her murder . you 're obsessed with her and you 're obsessed with her daughter !
good twist .
nobody said she was an actor .
bitch .
oh i wish i got that one on tape . it 'd put a smile on my face everytime i 'm down .
look who 's talking moneybags . you got more homes than i do .
really , you know you 'd make a fascinating interview . lifestyles of the rich and psychotic .
basements creep me out .
gale weathers would find a way .
possibly .
there a story in that building ?
no really ?
need to get in that building ?
ha . maybe i should join snl .
that 's funny .
and as a sane person . for you that must be quite a stretch .
you know in the movies , i play you as being much smarter .
none .
here 's how i see it . i 've got no house , no movie , no gun , and i 'm being stalked . because someone wants to kill me ? no , because someone wants to kill you . so now , starting now , i go where you go . that way , if someone wants to kill me , i 'll be with you , and since they really want to kill you , they wo n't kill me , they 'll kill you . make sense ?
i am gale weathers !
being gale weathers . what the hell are you doing ?
what the hell are you doing ?
geez .
no ! he 's not dead ! he 's still breathing ! look !
god damn it you two ! run ! hurry ! he 's dead !
i dunno but i can tell you that your 's will be the home video footage of me sticking my foot up your ass ! now come out and fight like a real man you pussy !
what 's your favorite scary movie gale ?
listen you sick bastard , what the fuck do you want ?
oh shit it 's my cell !
who 's phone ?
i do n't know . screw them . look , what 's important is that we stick together . no matter what . if anyone is next it 's you or me jen .
shit ! where the hell are tom and angelina ?
still that was a much better movie , i saw it at the premiere last week . god , what the hell am i getting sidetracked with this shit for ? ! we 've got ta get down to business .
i know right . it was kinda weak . that 's cause will kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it . the script was written by some new guy . he wrote arlington street .
and i die naked ? ! ugh ! this is complete bullshit . who wrote this piece of crap ?
wait a second , whoa ! calm down ! number one there were five different versions of the script given out . ben damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role . it only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script . and what , i die in stab 3 ?
god damn you gale weathers ! do n't you see ? the killer is choosing his victims as they die in the script ! ben damon 's character was the first one to get offed . so was his girlfriend - but she was n't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then sarah darling 's candy , and now me !
dewey , what the hell is she rambling about now ? what 's wrong jen , see yourself on one of those usa network winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting ?
you ! how can i ever get any fame playing you !
i 'm saying things got out of hand . maybe they did take advantage of her ! . maybe the sad truth is , this is not the city for innocence . no charges were brought . and the bottom line is , rina reynolds would n't play by the rules . you wan na get ahead in hollywood , you got ta play the game , or go home .
are you saying she was-
it was in the 70 's , everything was different . i was well known for my parties , rina knew what they were . it was for girls like her to meet men , men who could get them parts , if they made the right impression . nothing happened to her that she did n't invite , in one way or another , no matter what she said afterwards .
well how would you like his rotten carcass dug up and drug all over national tv ? why do n't you start talking .
now you listen to me , lois lane , let it go . it 's dead and buried . daddy took ol ' yeller out behind the barn and shot him in the head a long time ago .
i do n't think so ! just what happened to maureen when she was in hollywood ?
yeah .
just because you knew her ?
get real , that would make me a suspect !
and now ? i mean , murders on your set and still you say nothing ?
who ?
answer the question . you knew sidney 's mom ?
they 're the ones who approved it .
listen lois lane , i love your show and all but last month i happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because i 'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls . it was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior 's attentions .
oh come on ! why the hostility ?
well then , i guess i 'll be leaving then .
gale weathers ? ! what are you doing here ? no press on the set ! no press , no press on set ! get that woman out of here .
excuse me detective , i think we have some business to attend to .
you mean what 's left of us . yeah i 'm running on empty anyways . got ta refuel .
i think we should go inside . i have to have a talk with the cast . all of you .
really , cause that stunt lost me the lead role in roman polanski 's latest picture . huh , what a coincide i was picked up by roman bridger . well , not exactly the roman i wanted . get my point ? stab 3 is bullshit . fuck , because of your big mouth i 'm here , drinking piss water scotch with second rate fucking celebrities like jennifer jollie and yourself ! hey , i just got an idea . maybe i should have a look at your break line . that your car over there ?
heh , well , that 's tv journalism for ya . stage the news to boost ratings .
hey i really liked that piece you did on me last month . the one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs , and how i faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance would n't sky rocket .
tom prinze , tanked as usual . that 's a shocker .
gale weathers . what a surprise .
gale watchout !
let 's get out of here !
i know !
i know ! he killed kincaid !
gale he 's got dewey !
what are you talking about ?
we did some researching in the archives . sid , something dawned on me when i wrote the book on your mother 's murder . for two years of her life , 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the earth .
who 's this .
oh my god karen you scared the shit out of me ! what are you doing here ?
oh , you know , the usual small talk , `` what 's new , how ya been , how do you want to die ? ''
what 'd he say ?
hi , gale . i 'm glad you 're all right .
oh my god ! sidney , you ran fast or what ? hey .
roman knock it off ! do you people even know why you kill people ? you kill people cause you choose to and not because of any other fucking reason !
see sid , now comes the part where we get away with it ! the part where we win ! cause face it sidney , in this world , the bad guys win !
i ca n't take it anymore . this hollywood exploitation of the nightmare i lived has to be stopped . i did this to make you all repent for your sins , and now i 'm pleased i 've got my message across . good-bye .
wait a second sid . do n't you go jumping the gun . you have n't seen the best part . with the aides of the computer revolution of y2ki 've been able to steal your voice . ai n't it cool ? listen to what the police are gon na find next to your lifeless , mutilated body .
listen , i have no time for this . i 've heard this shit before ! so lets get on with it !
oh my god , angie crick ? from english class ?
i 'm a director sid , i direct . for example , angelina over there , she 's my partner . i can convince her to do anything . we 've been dating since i met her in woodsboro .
all the nightmares . all the hell i went through was because of you , you spineless bastard !
roman bridger , director . and brother . she slammed the door in my face , sid . said i was rina 's child and rina was dead . and it struck me , what a good idea ! so i watched her , made a little home movie , a little family film . seems maureen , mom , really got around . i mean , cotton weary was one thing , everybody knew about that , but billy 's father , that was the key ! your boyfriend did n't like seeing his daddy in my movies . did n't like it at all . and once i supplied the motive , all the kid needed was a few pointers . have a partner to sell out in case you get caught , find someone to frame , it was like her was making a movie .
my movie .
what ? what movie ?
it 's not just a new script , it 's a new movie .
has there been another goddamn rewrite ? how the fuck are we supposed to learn our lines when there 's a new script every 15 minutes ?
it is in my script .
roman that 's not the line .
it 's sarah .
i 'm hanging up right now .
but you know my favorite name ?
whatever . come on , who is this ? i think you have the wrong number .
why do n't we just read the scene ? candy , is that like candy cane or candy apple ?
this is candy . hang on , let me get some clothes . see ! i do n't ' understand why i have to start the scene in the shower ! the whole shower things been done , 'vertigo ' hello ! and i mean , my boyfriend just died , why am i showering ?
who 's this ?
who 's this ?
hello .
page 22.. ring ring . hello ?
page 22 , candy 's big moment .
huh , fine .
um hmm ... umhmm great , so let 's run the lines .
i 'm not happy that i 'm 35 playing a 21 year old . i 'm not happy that i have to die naked ! and i 'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend 's been cut into mcnuggets .
you 're not happy with your part .
what character ? i 'm candy , the chick who gets killed second . i 'm only in two scenes !
all right , since i got you on the phone , let 's talk about your character .
oh it 's no problem , i 'm just ... looking at your music video awards .
sarah , it 's roman , i 'm sorry i 'm running late , i 'm still on the 405 , i 'm about 10 minutes away .
oh shit . hello ? director 's office .
damn . he called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight .
no .
make-up . you need it . hey , roman is n't here ?
roman and everybody else went home for the night . i 'm here for a make-up test .
i 'm just saying , though . what if there 's someone out there stalking actors ? huh ? then what ?
would you give that script a rest ? it 's like a friggen umbilical cord to you .
scene 32. int . candy 's living room - night . `` what are you talking about ricky , the murders were a completely isolated incident '' .
what are you talking about ? the murders were a completely isolated incident .
and still the film is number one at the box office this weekend . beat out american pasty and arlington street .
goddamnit i am getting so fed up with these re-writes . it 's like every five minutes there 's a new script . god , and you just know this all because of stab 2 's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting .
it 's good to see you again sidney . i was growing real impatient . go ahead . explore . i 'll catch up with you later .
alright i 'm here , now show your face so we can finish this .
i thought you wanted me here ?
you 're doing real good . ca n't you figure it out ? i wan na finish this where it all began . woodsboro .
alright , i 'm here . now what ?
you follow directions good . now let 's wrap this production . go to the sunrise studios backlot . i 'll call you when you get there .
yeah ?
i 'll call you , when you 're on your way .
where ?
she 'd have been so happy , sidney , to know we 'd be together .
where ?
i do n't want them , i want you ! it 's simple . you show yourself , they survive , you run , they die !
you 're dead !
are real ? how do you know you 're not hearing things ? how do you know i 'm not someone in your head ? somewhere , you know .
how do i know their voices are --
always hard being friends with you , sidney . when you 're friends with sidney , you die ! well these friends do n't have to , sidney . it 's up to you .
go there .
yes .
do n't do it ! if you do one thing to attract attention , one thing , i 'll kill them both . now , do you have somewhere we can be alone ?
the question is n't who i am . the question is , who 's with me .
who is this ?
{ a click } i only her you too , sidney .
great . a spirited one . i 'll be seeing you real soon sidney . real soon .
if you lay a hand on him i 'll fucking kill you !
no . we play in my court this time . come to hollywood . stab 3 's going to cutting corners cast-wise . and i 've got my eyes set on a technical advisor named dewey rielly .
the final act ? well let 's play asshole !
heh . so you think sidney . so you think . it 's all been building up to this sid . every stab . every scream . every ounce of blood that 's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment . welcome tothe final act .
no . you did n't kill my mother . billy loomis and stu macher did .
let them try . you 'll never find me . i 've already gotten away with murder before . for instance , maureen prescott .
you sick fuck i 'm tracing this call as we speak ! the police are gon na nail your ass !
i want to finish what i started . i want to finish the game .
w-what do you want ?
do you think it 's over sidney ? do you ?
it 's mother , sidney , now be a good girl and turn on the news . do it !
who the fuck is this ?
do n't you want to know how you can help , sidney ? are you listening to me , huh ?
i 'm sorry , your voice .
no i need to call you . just you .
well then the people you need to call are the police .
uh-huh i 'm sure . i 've killed someone ! oh my god i 've actually killed someone !
are you sure ?
laura i think i just killed somebody .
yes , hi i 'm laura , i 'm a trained counselor . how can i help you .
hello ?
i ca n't ... i 'm bad off , billy . you cut too deep .
find her you dipshit !
where the fuck did she go ?
i do n't know billy but i 'm hurtin ' .
odds are -- she 'll miss anyway .
she ca n't get both of us .
she looked dead . still does .
i thought she was dead .
no , it 's not .
it 's on the table .
get the gun . i 'll untie pops .
that 's it , billy . i ca n't take any more . i 'm feeling woozy .
everyone dies but us . we get to carry on and plan the sequel . let 's face it , these days -- you got ta have a sequel .
and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head . it 's a perfect ending .
except for me and billy ... we were left for dead ...
what if your father snapped ? your mom 's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree , killing everyone ...
yeah ...
ready ?
you know what time it is , sid ? it 's after midnight . it 's your mother 's anniversary . we killed her exactly one year ago today .
this is the best part , sid . billy 's got it all figured out . why do you think we kept your father alive so long ? why did we save you for last ?
that 's right and now that you 're no longer a virgin . you got ta die -- those are the rules .
think about it . on the off chance i get caught -- a motive like that could divide a jury for years , do n't you think ? . you took my mother , so i took yours . big sympathy factor . maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior . it certainly fucked you up . it made you have sex with a psychopath .
and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people ? do n't think so . you see , it 's scarier when there 's no motive , sid .
nope .
yeah , we just watched a few movies . took a few notes . it was fun .
tell that to cotton weary . you would n't believe how easy it was to frame him .
and if you get it right -- you die .
it 's an easy game . we ask you a question . if you get it wrong -- you die .
you have to play , sid . do n't want to disappoint your dad . he 's been waiting around all night .
oh yeah .
where ya going ? it 's not over yet . we 've got one more surprise -- stu , i believe it 's your turn .
i was hoping sid and i could talk .
dude . what are you doing here ?
you know it .
you ready to party hard tonight ?
oh ...
because i 'm trying to build your self-esteem . you 're far too sensitive .
i was just asking . why are you always at me ?
duh ... that 's quick .
so you gon na try and make up with sid ?
thanks , butt wart . you did good .
piece of cake . she 'll be there .
how 'd you do ?
sorry .
you open your mouth and stupidity pours out .
owwww ...
no one 's saying you did .
i did n't kill anybody .
sorry .
it 's called tact , you fuckrag .
what ? she asked .
we 're gon na have to keep you , billy . the governor 's got sbi , fbi , and god knows who else on their way down here .
no , i did n't . i did n't kill anyone , sheriff .
did you ride past casey becker 's house ?
and last night ? sidney said you crawled through her window last night too ?
yes , sir .
you rode your bike out there ?
i just wanted to see her , that 's all .
thank you , hank . we 're on it . what were you doing out at sidney 's tonight ?
got ta find me first , you pansy-assed mama 's boy .
i 'm gon na rip you up bitch . just like your slut whore mother .
not so fast . we 're gon na play a little game . it 's called guess who just called the police and reported your sorry motherfucking ass ?
you bitch -- where the fuck are you ?
are you alone in the house ?
hello ?
got the ending figured out yet ? time 's running out .
stop it !
jesus ... fuck , that hurt .
we did your mom a favor , sid . the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something .
i do n't understand ...
why ? why ? did you hear that , stu ? i think she wants a motive . hmmm ... i do n't really believe in motives , sid . i mean , did norman bates have a motive ?
why did you kill my mother ?
we already played that game . you lost , remember ?
fuck you .
it 's called guess how i 'm going to die !
it 's okay . give me the gun .
no ! do n't believe him .
i 'm alright . got ta ... get ... help .
i thought you were ...
no , but if it were you , that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track . using your one phone call to call me so i would n't think it was you .
you do n't still think it was me ?
uh-huh .
yeah ... and when i called no one answered .
no , sheriff burke called your dad . i saw him .
i called my dad .
when you 're arrested -- you 're allowed one phone call ? who did you call ?
what ?
who did you call ?
yeah ... i think so .
are you serious ?
you heard me .
what ?
or even a good porno .
sshh ... it 's okay .
ssshh ... everything 's gon na be okay . i promise .
i wan na let go . i do ...
sure it is , sid . it 's all a movie . life 's one great big movie . only you ca n't pick your genre .
but this is life . this is n't a movie .
sure it does . it 's like jodie foster in silence of the lambs when she kept having flashbacks of her dead father .
everytime i get close to you i see my mom . i know it does n't make sense .
oh sidney ...
i think in some weird analytical , psychological bullshit way i 'm scared i 'm gon na turn out just like her , you know ? like the bad seed or something ...
but you 're right -- enough is enough . i ca n't wallow in the grief process forever and i ca n't keep lying to myself about who my mom was .
you lost your mom ...
no , billy . i 'm the one who 's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress .
so ... i 'm sorry . i 've been a selfish shit and i 'm sorry .
so ...
it 's okay . we need to talk .
subtlety , stu . look it up .
you have to move on , sid .
your parents split up . it 's not the same thing . your mom left town , she 's not in a coffin somewhere .
when are you gon na let that go , sid ? when my mom left my dad -- i just accepted it . this is the way it is . she 's not coming back .
tomorrow . one year tomorrow .
it 's been a year since she died .
no , it 's me , billy . i need time . i 'm still adjusting to my mom .
is it the sex thing ? am i being too pushy ?
no ...
then what is it ? is there somebody else ?
you know that 's not true .
understand what ? that i got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me .
i 'm so sorry ... please understand .
see , it could n't have been me . i was in jail , remember ?
i know . he called again last night at tatum 's house .
the police say i scared him off . it was n't me , sid .
no ... i do n't ... it 's just ... oh god , billy , someone was there , someone tried to kill me .
hey , hey , it 's just me .
jesus , shit !
he 's here . he 's trying to kill me ...
i heard screaming . the door was locked . are you okay ...
oh billy ... please ... god ...
what 's that ?
would you settle for a pg-13 relationship ?
i 'm going ... i 'm going .
you know what my dad will do to you ?
no , no . i would n't dream of breaking your underwear rule . i just thought we might do some on top of the clothes stuff .
so you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump .
yeah , it was edited for tv . all the good stuff was cut out and i started thinking about us and how two years ago , we started off kinda hot and heavy , a nice solid `` r '' rating on our way to an nc17 . and how things have changed and , lately , we 're just sot of ... edited for television .
oh it did ?
and i was home , bored , watching television , the exorcist was on and it got me thinking of you .
now that it 's out of your system .
it just occurred to me that i 've never snuck through your bedroom window .
what are you doing here ?
close call .
i 'll only stay a sec .
my dad 's in the other room .
you sleep in that ?
what are you doing here ?
i 'm sorry . do n't hate me .
billy ? what the ...
your call .
do n't make me ... i ca n't ... i wo n't .
there are two doors to your house . a front door and a back one . if you answer correctly -- you live .
what ?
what door am i at ?
answer the question and i will .
... leave me alone ... please ...
lucky , for you there 's a bonus round . but poor steve ... i 'm afraid ... he 's out .
you tricked me ...
then you should know jason 's mother -- mrs. vorhees was the original killer . jason did n't show up until the sequel .
it was jason . i saw that goddamned movie twenty times . it was jason .
afraid not .
no it 's not . it was jason .
i 'm sorry . that 's the wrong answer .
name the killer in friday the 13th .
... please ... no ...
then answer the question . same category .
please go away ! leave us alone !
but you 're doing so well .
noooo ... .
now for the real question .
yes !
michael ... michael myers .
i ca n't think .
what 's his name ?
please..stop ...
come on , yes you do .
i do n't know ...
come on . it 's you favorite scary movie , remember ? he had a white mask , he stalked the baby-sitters .
no ...
name the killer in halloween .

i 'll even give you a warm up question .

it 's an easy category . movie trivia .
no ... please .
come on . it 'll be fun .
please do n't do this ...
turn off the light .
what kind of game ?
which is it ?
nooo !
then he dies . right now .
no ...
i wan na play a game .
why are you doing this ?
that all depends on you .
please do n't hurt him .
guess .
where are you ?
go to the back door and turn on the porch light -- again .
how do you know his name ?
his name would n't be steve , would it ?
so you better leave .
i believe you ...
i 'm telling you the truth . i lied before ...
i 'm getting scared .
i swear it . and he 's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you .
sure ...
i lied . i do have a boyfriend and he 'll be here any second and your ass better be gone .
i thought you did n't have a boyfriend .
my boyfriend will be here any second and he 'll be pissed when i tell him ...
or else what ?
look , enough is enough . you had your fun now you better leave me alone or else .
to see what your insides look like .
what do you want ?
they 'd never make it in time .
i 'm two seconds from calling the police .
more of a game , really .
is this some kind of a joke ?
no , you listen , you little bitch . if you hang up on me again i 'll gut you like a fish . understand ?
listen , asshole ...
no-bored .
you getting scared ?
dial someone else , okay ?
to talk .
what do you want ?
i told you not to hang up on me .
yes ?
do n't ...
got ta go .
do n't hang up on me .
nah , i do n't think so ...
wait ... i thought we were gon na go out .
i have to go now .
what do you think i said ?
that 's not what you said .
i want to now who i 'm talking to .
what did you say ?
because i want to know who i 'm looking at .
why do you want to know my name ?
you never told me your name .
no .
maybe . do you have a boyfriend ?
why ? you wan na ask me out ?
so , you got ta boyfriend ?
the first one was , but the rest sucked .
freddy -- that 's right . i liked that movie . it was scary .
yeah ... freddy krueger .
is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers ?
uh ... nightmare on elm street .
guess .
uh ... halloween . you know , the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters . what 's yours ?
you have to have a favorite .
i do n't know .
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
uh-huh .
do you like scary movies ?
just some scary movie .
really ? what ?
i 'm getting ready to watch a video .
i only eat popcorn at the movies .
uh-huh .
you 're making popcorn ?
popcorn .
what 's that noise ?
i do n't think so .
you tell me your name , i 'll tell you mine .
who is this ?
why do n't you want to talk to me ?
hello .
they 've got 900 numbers for that . seeya .
i want to talk to you for a second .
what ?
wait , wait , do n't hang up .
you 're forgiven . bye now .
to apologize .
so why did you dial it again ?
i 'm sorry . i guess i dialed the wrong number .
hello .
it happens . take it easy .
do i ?
i think you have the wrong number .
i do n't know .
what number are you trying to reach ?
what number is this ?
who are you trying to reach ?
who is this ?
yes .
i 'll get my camera .
i 'll call for backup .
we got ta get back . jesus . he 's here . what the fuck is he doing here ?
sidney 's father ?
shit . it 's neil prescott 's car .
i do n't think you 're so bad .
people treat me like the antichrist of television journalism .
what about gale weathers ? i sound like a meteorologist ...
nah ... it 's just this town 's way of not taking me serious .
i like it . it 's ... sexy .
dwight . dewey was something i got stuck with a long time ago .
so is dewey your real name ?
no ! i mean ... i should probably take just you .
can i bring kenny ?
ma'am , i am the deputy of this town .
i 'd love to . if you 're sure it 's alright ?
a car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road .
what kind of lead ?
sheriff just radioed me . i 'm gon na check out a possible lead . thought you might like to join me .
mind if i join you ?
keeping an eye on things . checking the place out .
then what are you doing here ?
not much story here . just a bunch of kids cutting loose .
you never know when or where a story will break .
what brings you out to these parts ?
deputy ... good evening .
evening , ma'am .
you are precious . please , call me gale .
i just turned 25. i was 24 for a whole year .
that 's quite alright . if i may say so , ma'am , you 're much prettier in person .
am i keeping you ? i 'm sorry .
if you 'll excuse me , ma'am .
we have n't ruled out that possibil ...
he 's not a suspect , is he ?
no , not yet .
really ? you small town guys are good . and have you located sidney 's father ?
we 're tracking the cellular phone bill .
well , we can hope , ca n't we ? we certainly do n't have any leads . a ghost mask , a cellular phone -- not much there .
serial killer is not really accurate , ma'am . the killer has yet to strike twice .
boy , you people sure do make fuss over a serial killer .
twenty-five , huh ? in a demographic study i proved to be most popular amongst males , 11-24. i just missed you . of course , you do n't look a day over twelve , except in the upper torso area . does the force require that you work out ?
i 'm twenty-five years old , ma'am .
i know , i should be in new york covering the sharon stone stalker but who knew ? please , call me gale . you look awfully young to be a police officer .
you 're not supposed to be here , ma'am .
and why is that ? has something happened ?
well ... uh ... yes ma'am . for the time being .
productive . so they 're closing down the school ?
i know who you are , ma'am . how 's the eye ?
hi ! gale weathers . field correspondent , inside story .
she 's with me . i just wanted to check on things .
what is she doing here ?
shit .
sorry , police orders . i 'll stay out of the way , i promise .
no , dewey . you 'll ruin the whole night .
do n't be so self-righteous . it 's just a little blow out -- we 'll be perfectly safe .
a party ? mom 's gon na kill you . then me .
i 'm sorry , deputy dewey-boy but we 're ready to go .
what did mama tell you ? when i wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law .
hold up a sec ...
hey ... dewey . can we go now ?
yes , you doofus .
does mom know ?
you ca n't be here , tatum . this is an official crime scene .
oh , god , sid , i 'm sorry i was late .
what are you doing here ?
not yet .
should i be worried ?
afraid not .
have they found my father ?
looks like i 'm your personal bodyguard tonight , sid .
yeah .
you girls ready .
thanks , dewey . but with my luck they 'd cast tori spelling .
i see you as a young meg ryan myself .
hey , i saw that movie . true story , 'bout some killer in texas .
god , look at this place , it 's the town that dreaded sundown .
and my dad ? any word on him ?
i know . we 're checking every cellular account in the county . any calls made to you or casey becker are being cross-referenced . it 's gon na take time but we 'll find him .
somebody called me , dewey . i 'm not making it up .
billy was released . his cellular bill was clean . he did n't make those calls .
not yet , but we 're looking . if you need anything ...
any word on my dad ?
we 'll find him , sid . do n't worry .
i do n't know . i guess .
he 's not registered . could he have gone to another hotel ?
at the airport .
you 're sure it was the hilton ?
did you reach my dad ?
... yeah ...
you gon na be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit ?
yes , sir .
watch her . do n't let on -- just keep your eyes out .
she 'll be with her friends over at stu maker 's tonight .
hold off for now . just stay close to her .
she 's with my sister . should i bring her in ?
he 'd have to be crazy . where 's sidney ?
you think he could still be in town ?
they believe he 's out of state by now . we 'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night . if he 's not picked up by morning -- we 'll do a house to house .
have you contacted the bureau ?
there 's more . guess what tomorrow is ? the anniversary of his wife 's death . it all fits . he 's our man .
could n't his cellular number have been cloned ?
listen up , dewey , because it 's bad . real bad . aircomp just faxed us . the calls were listed to neil prescott -- sidney 's father . he made the calls with his cellular phone . it 's confirmed .
keeping my eye on sidney .
dewey ! where the hell you been , boy ?
yes , sir , sheriff .
she 's okay . looks like some boys were teasing her . himbry 's shutting down the school though . i want you to take look around .
we have n't located her dad yet .
she staying with you ?
twenty years ago i woulda said not a chance . but these kids today ... damn if i know .
they 're pulling loomis ' account . but it 'll be morning before we see something . you think he did it ?
what about the cellular phone bill ?
that ghost mask is sold at both kroger 's and walmart . neither of which keep purchase records .
have to be . the shit she 's gone through .
she 's tough .
how is she ?
drive by patrol .
what were you doing out here ?
i was first to respond .
he 's her boyfriend .
hank loomis ' kid ? aw ... jesus ...
we got him , sheriff . billy loomis .
how is everything ?
it 's deputy riley today , sid .
not my daughter ... not my ...
casey ! casey !
i can hear her . oh mother of god , i can hear her .
where is she ?
the phone 's dead .
casey ? where are you honey ? call the police , goddamnit .
call the police .
where is she ?
casey ? casey ?
what is it ? where 's casey ?
jesus ...
i told you to send it back .
that fish smelled strong .
as long as it records i do n't give a shit . we 're not doing a remote .
about thirty seconds .
what 's the delay ?
the control board 's glitched . you know we ca n't carry a live picture .
prep the compact , we 'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight 's festivities .
what 's the plan ?
not this time . i owe cotton that much . hell , even i thought that man was guilty .
but it 's so much easier when we make it up .
if i 'm gon na blow this up -- i need hard proof .
when did that ever stop you ? you ca n't sit on this . this is huge .
no , not so fast . we have nothing concrete .
you want to go live ?
jesus christ ! an innocent man on death row . a killer still on the loose . kenny , tell me i 'm dreaming .
jesus ! the camera-hurry !
what ? what ?
but could n't it have been someone else you saw wearing that coat ? the same person who planted it in cotton 's car , framing him ? the same person who really killed your mother ?
i saw him leaving wearing it .
he was drunk that night . he left his coat at your house , after your mother seduced him ...
he 's lying . she would n't have touched him . he raped her , then butchered her . her blood was all over his coat .
not one word . he admits to having sex with your mother but that 's all .
has his story changed ?
many times .
have you talked to cotton ?
i think you falsely identified him . yes .
during the trial , you did all those stories about me . you called me a liar .
he was convicted in a court of law . your testimony put him away . it does n't matter what i think .
do you still think he 's innocent ?
what is your problem ? you got what you wanted . cotton weary is in jail . they 're gon na gas him . a book is not gon na change that .
and it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories .
your mother 's murder was last year 's hottest court case . somebody was gon na write a book about it .
you owe my mother .
i owe you shit .
please . you owe me .
forget it .
off the record . no cameras .
kenny . camera . now .
i want to talk to you .
just stay back .
i 'm not here to fight .
i 'll send you a copy .
i 'll look for it .
it 'll be out later this year .
how 's the book ?
yes , that 's right .
it 's okay , tatum . she 's just doing her job . right , gale ?
ricki lake .
where do you get this shit ?
and it fucked her up royally . think about it . it makes perfect sense . her mom 's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world , she 's disillusioned , where 's god , etc . completely suicidal . and one day she snaps . she wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year . and homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression .
cut some slack . she watched her mom get butchered .
please , it 's common knowledge . her mother was a trollop .
you 're evil .
maybe she 's a slut just like her mom .
why would sidney want to be with steve ? she has her own bubble-butt boyfriend billy .
maybe she was hot for steve and killed them both in a jealous rage .
and why would she do that ?
what if she did it ? what if sidney killed casey and steve ?
for attention . the girl has some serious issues .
why would she lie about it ?
she was never attacked . i think she made it all up .
who are you ?
looks like you fingered the wrong guy ... again .
leavemealone !
poor billy-boyfriend . an innocent guy does n't stand a chance with you .
hello sidney .
hello ?
if you hang up , you 'll die just like your mother .
good try , randy . tell tatum to hurry . bye now .
what am i doing ?
uh-huh .
can you see me right now ?
right here .
so where are you ?
that 's the original part .
why would you call me from my front porch ?
your front porch .
so where are you ?
the question is not who am i. the question is where am i ?
so who are you ?
maybe that 's because i 'm not randy .
that is so unoriginal . you disappoint me , randy .
are you alone in the house ?
because they 're all the same . it 's always some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl -- who ca n't act -- who always runs up the stairs when she should be going out the front door . they 're ridiculous .
and why is that ?
do n't start . you know i do n't watch that shit .
what 's your favorite scary movie ?
i like that thing you 're doing with your voice , randy . it 's sexy .
do you like scary movies , sidney ?
aha , randy , you gave yourself away . are you calling from work ? tatum 's on her way over .
scary night , is n't it ? with the murders and all , it 's like right out of a horror movie or something .
i have no idea .
sleep tight , sweetie .
have a good trip .
got it .
... so call if you need me .
... out at the airport ...
no ? oh , well ... i 'm hitting the sack . my flight leaves first thing in the morning . now the expo runs all weekend so i wo n't be back til sunday . there 's cash on the table and i 'll be staying at the raleigh hilton ...
no you did n't .
i heard screaming .
can you knock ?
are you okay ?
twice .
i thought blockbuster fired you .
working , thank you .
fuck you , nut case . where were you last night ?
oooooh ... before or after he sliced and diced .
stu was with me last night .
you got it .
only if it 's a nice meg ryan movie .
listen to me , sid . i found tatum . she 's dead , she 's been killed ... i think stu did it .
do n't come any closer .
do n't shoot . it 's me .
stop . right there .
she 's the scream queen .
the fog , terror train , prom night -- how come jamie lee curtis is in all these movies ?
no , sid .
come on , sid . give me the gun .
do n't listen to him . it 's him . he 's the one .
his movie nut mind has snapped , sid . he 's gone psycho .
i 'll be right back .
yeah .
wan na another beer ?
there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie . for instance : 1. you can never have sex . the minute you get a little nookie -- you 're as good as gone . sex always equals death . 2. never drink or do drugs . the sin factor . it 's an extension of number one . and 3. never , ever , ever , under any circumstances , say `` i 'll be right back . ''
not until trading places in '83 . jamie lee was always the virgin in horror movies . she did n't show her tits until she went legit .
i wan na see jamie lee 's breasts . when do we see jamie lee 's breasts ?
like you had one .
there goes my chance with sid .
he came to make up .
what 's leatherface doing here ?
i can cry on cue .
we could be like two grief stricken students and we 'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly .
i had 'em hid in the foreign section .
i thought everything was checked out .
it 's 1995 -- motives are incidental .
and what would be your motive ?
you 're absolutely right . i 'm the first to admit it . if this were a scary movie , i 'd be the prime suspect .
so while they 're off investigating a dead end , billy , who 's been written off as a suspect , is busy planning his next hunting expedition .
which is you ...
because he 's probably dead . his body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere ... eyes gauged . see , the police are always off track with this shit , if they 'd watch prom night they 'd save time . there 's formula to it . a very simple one . everyone 's always a suspect -- the father , the principal , the town derelict ...
i think her father did it . how come they ca n't find his ass ?
could be . now that billy 's tried to mutilate her , you think sid would go out with me ?
she 's saving herself for you .
maybe sidney would n't have sex with him .
so what 's his reason ?
there 's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend . that 's the beauty of it all . simplicity . besides , if it 's too complicated you lose your target audience .
why would he want to kill his own girlfriend ?
because , obviously they do n't watch enough movies . this is standard horror movie stuff . prom night revisited .
the why 'd the police let him go ?
you 're such a little lap dog . he 's got killer printed all over his forehead .
it was all a misunderstanding . he did n't do anything .
if you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section ?
what ?
yeah , i 'm off early -- curfew you know . now that 's poor taste .
you coming tonight ?
we had a run in the mass murder section .
jesus , this place is packed .
did you really put her liver in the mailbox ? i hear they found her liver in the mailbox .
i 'm gon na gut your ass in a second .
besides -- `` takes a man to do something like that . ''
it would certainly improve your high school q .
what are you saying ? that i killed her or something ?
and are the police aware you dated the victim ?
before she dumped him for steve .
for about two seconds .
yeah , casey and steve were completely hollowed out . takes a man to do something like that .
that was an ice pick -- not exactly the same .
peer pressure ... i 'm way to sensitive .
so stu , what 's your motive ? billy 's got one . the police are on their way . what are you going to tell them ?
you 'll never get away with this .
the official term is `` psychotic '' .
you 're crazy -- both of you .
it 's all part of the game .
why are you doing this ?
guess , i wo n't be needing this anymore .
you guys can go up to my parents room ? to talk and ... whatever .
if tatum sees you -- she 'll draw blood .
cool . see you guys tonight . bring food .
yeah , okay ... whatever .
remember , there 's safety in numbers .
my parents are out of town . it 'll be like my hurricane bash last year . nothing extreme . just a few of us , hangin ' .
are you serious ?
and to celebrate this impromptu fall break , i propose we have a party . tonight , my house .
are you kidding ? this is like christmas .
why are they doing this ?
hey , stu ? did n't you use to date casey ?
you heard billy -- shut the fuck up .
deal .
there 's that sense of humor . i knew it still existed . ohh , sid , let 's have some fun tonight .
oh , sidney . what ? a guy can talk tits til he 's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie . watch out .
tatum !
watch the show , sid . his basket is bigger than the one you 're pushing .
what secret meaning ? like a satanical thing ?
grant wrote the song himself . i 'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning , `` eight is enough ... ''
no way .
during foreplay , i sing the theme song to myself . `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' it 's a real turn on .
how does that get you in the mood with stu ?
grant goodeve -- the oldest brother on eight is enough . remember that show ? he was the one who lived off alone . he would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing `` eight is enough to fill our lives with love ... '' he had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from charles in charge . god , i was in love with grant , he was so hot . the show came on every day after school right during my puberty years . grant goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman .
who ?
with stu , there 's little time to stop and reflect . but sometimes before , to relax and get in the mood , i think about grant goodeve .
what do you think about when you 're having sex ?
billy and his penis do n't deserve you .
but he 's been so patient with me , tatum . you know , with all the sex stuff . how many guys would put up with a girlfriend who 's sexually anorexic ?
you have a few intimacy issues as a result of your mother 's untimely death . it 's no big deal . you 'll thaw out .
billy 's right . whenever he touches me , i just ca n't relax .
he better not be . i told stu to keep his mouth shut . i think we can live without everybody 's all american for one night .
is billy going to be there tonight ?
oh , god ...
hey , sid . just think if they make a movie about you . who 's gon na play you ?
come on , let 's rock .
you 're right . i 'm cracking up . ignore me .
do n't go there , sid . you 're starting to sound like some wes carpenter flick . do n't freak yourself out -- we 've got a long night ahead of us .
if i was wrong cotton , then he 's still out there .
well ... you can only hear that richard gere-gerbil story so many times before you have to start believing it .
and you believe it ?
it goes further back , sid . there 's been talk about other men .
created by that little tabloid twit gale weathers .
you ca n't prove a rumor . that 's why it 's a rumor .
if they were having an affair how come that cotton could n't prove it in court ?
i did n't say that , sid . but you know there were rumors . your dad was always out of town on business . maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman .
so you think my mom was a slut too ?
maybe cotton weary is telling the truth . maybe he was having an affair with your mom .
come on . pathos has it 's perks .
i do n't know ...
this could be good . what do you think , sid ?
it was him , tatum . i know it .
it was just some sick fuck having a laugh .
just ignore him . you had good reason to think what you did .
i bet he 's pissed .
shit , what is he doing here ?
i want you to meet me here right after class , okay ?
this is a mistake . i should n't be here .
but if it was n't billy it could be anybody . he could be here at school right now .
just relax . you 're at school now . no one can get you here .
just a sec ... i need to talk to someone .
come on , sid .
it 's alright . i 'll get it .
take a message .
i knew this guy was too perfect . he was destined to have a flaw .
he was there , tatum .
do you really think billy did it ?
no , nothing 's like it used to be .
just like old times , ai n't it ?
just another sleepover at the riley 's .
her dad 's out of town . she 's staying with us .
it 's okay . she was supposed to pick me up .
bye .
whatever . just hurry .
good , 'cause i wan na swing by blockbuster and get us a video . i was thinkin ' tom cruise in all the right moves . you know , if you pause it just right you can see his penis .
i 'm not worried .
do n't worry . casey and steve did n't bite it til way after ten .
it 's past seven .
practice ran late . i 'm on my way .
later .
thanks , tatum .
i 'll be there by seven . i promise
uh-huh , it 's just ... you know , the police and reporters ... it brings it all back .
yeah , yeah ... are you okay ?
tell your mom i said thanks .
no prob . i 'll pick you up after practice .
you sure i can stay over ? my dad wo n't be back til sunday .
how do you gut someone ?
or a man 's mentality .
they do n't know . dewey said this is the worst crime they 've ever seen . even worse than ... well it 's bad . they 're bringing in the feds . this is big .
they think it 's school-related ?
fucking clueless -- they 're interrogating the entire school . teachers , students , staff , janitors ...
do they know who did it ?
not anymore . her parents found her hanging from a tree . her insides on the outside .
casey becker ? she sits next to me in english .
and not just killed , sid . we 're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end .
no way .
oh god ! you do n't know ? casey becker and steve forrest were killed last night .
what happened ?
do you believe this shit ?
hey , guess who 's here ? it 's that chick from inside story ?
what am i ? the beer wench ?
i got it . tatum get me a beer . they 're in the fridge in the garage .
tits -- see .
with that set of lungs -- she should be .
where you guys been ? we had to start without you .
that 's mature .
okay , but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you .
for once , stu , drop it .
is this not cool or what ? hey , sid , what happened ?
hey , go easy , tatum . he did n't do it .
you know if i were accused of carving up two people , i 'd take the opportunity to skip school .
i did . he 's full of shit .
i thought you dumped her for me .
that is so sexist . the killer could easily be female -- basic instinct .
because there 's no way a girl could have killed them .
i do n't know , they just did .
hunt ? why would they ask if you like to hunt ?
i 'm in .
what do you think ?
ease back , mills .
how is it working for a scumbag like this ? you proud of yourself ?
you 're wound too tight , mills . let it go .
he 's pissing in our faces again and we 're just taking it .
he would n't just turn himself in . it does n't make any sense .
you do n't . it goes to court now .
so far it 's all dead ends . no credit history . no employment history . his bank account 's only five years old and it started as cash . we 're even trying to trace his furniture , but for now all we know is he 's independently wealth , well educated and totally insane . we may never know how he got that way .
what about the trace on his bank account and the guns ? there must be something to connect him with a past .
he cuts off the skin if his fingertips . that 's why we ca n't find a single usable print in the apartment . he 's been doing it for quite a while . keeps cutting before the papillary line can grow back .
go start picking up the pieces . we 'll shuffle some paper and try to get you a new partner .
thank you .
that 's not necessary . you 're in .
there 's nothing that says i have to work with him . if somerset wants out , `` goodbye . '' give it to me .
how 's that ?
give it to me .
i do n't have anyone else to give this to , somerset , you know that . and nobody 's going to swap with you .
i 'll see you .
i guess ... decide for yourself . i do n't know what it says . i 'm going to go .
i read about it in the paper .
he 's being arraigned tomorrow .
it would be too hard .
they 're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go , but i told them not to expect it .
yeah , that 's true .
we figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house .
thank you . tell them , thank you .
i can breathe withour pain now , so i guess i feel great .
how you feeling ?
he 's not finished .
well , there he sits . it 's not supposed to make sense .
really ?
it 's always been like this .
i have no understanding of this place anymore .
i heard .
did you read in the paper today , about the man who was walking his dog ? he was attacked , and his wallet and his watch were taken . and then , while he was still lying unconscious , his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes . it happened four blocks from here .
you know .
what are you talking about ?
ca n't you feel it yet ? ca n't you feel that feeling ... ? you 're not going to be a cop anymore .
i 'll get a job , maybe on a farm . i 'll work on the house .
come on . what are you going to do with yourself out there ?
good .
yeah .
i 'm sure everyone 's doing their best .
i thought you might want to be filled in .
it 's none of my business anymore .
greed . it was written in blood .
already .
there was a second .
no , i have n't heard .
have you heard ?
everything else was taken as close to conclusion as humanly possible . also ... this should n't be his first assignment .
you 've left unfinished business before .
i know what you 're thinking , okay ? you do n't want to get in bed with this every night , but it 's different now . you 're retiring . in six days you 're all the way gone .
this ca n't be my last duty here . it will go on and on .
what 's this : `` i 'm declining this case ? '' it do n't work that way .
one is gluttony .
hey , so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins . but , this was a fat guy . the killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him . and , writing on the walls happens all the time . it 's like the fashionable thing to do .
... envy , sloth , pride and lust . seven .
so what ? this victim ...
there are seven deadly sins . gluttony , wrath , greed ...
announcing what ?
`` dear detectives , long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light . '' it 's the murderer 's way of announcing himself .
he had a gun . he had a gun ... and he made it happen . he made me do it ! he made me put that ... that thing on . oh , christ ! he made me wear it ... and ... and he told me to fuck her . he had the gun in my mouth .
who tied her down ? you or him ?
she was ... she was on the bed . she was just sitting on the bed .
where was the prostitute ? where was she ?
what ? what ?
where was the girl ?
and ... and ... and he said ... he asked me if i was married . and , i could see he had a gun in his hand .
okay ...
put it down . put it on the ground .
this guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here . he wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock .
i 'm ... i 'm just delivering a package .
who are you ? what are you doing out here ?
what the hell 's going on ?
turn around . hands on your head !
jesus christ , man , do n't shoot me !
no !
you did n't know .
her pretty head .
give me the gun .
i visited your home this morning , after you left .
david ... please ...
it 's surprising how easily a member of the press can purchase information from the men in your precinct .
why ?
what time is it ?
it 's not too far away now .
what 's so exciting ?
it does n't matter who i am . who i am means absolutely nothing . you need to turn left here ... at the traffic light .
i mean , at this point , what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself ?
what do you mean ?
hello .
i do n't believe it .
because i envy your normal life . envy is my sin .
somerset ...
i want you to know , i wish i could have lived like you do .
what the fuck is going on ?
here he comes .
shut up !
you 've made a good life for yourself ...
what the fuck is going on here ? !
i wish i could have been a normal man like you . i wish i could have a simple life .
it 's close .
just keep leading the way .
sit back .
and , i remember breaking your nose . you 're only alive because i did n't kill you .
i seem to remember knocking on your door .
tell me what it was that gave me away . what was the piece of evidence you were going to use against me right before i walked up to you and put my hands in the air .
really ? just biding your time , then ? toying with me . is that it ? letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in ?
we would have gotten you eventually .
you 're going to be remembered , and it 's all because of me . and , the only reason i 'm here right now is because i wanted to be .
and , why is that ?
you should be thanking me .
delusions of grandeur .
a woman ... so ugly on the inside that she could n't bare to go on living if she could n't be beautiful on the outside . a drug dealer ... a drug dealing pederast , actually . and , do n't forget the disease spreading whore . only in a world this shitty could you even try to say these were innocent people and keep a straight face . that 's the point . you see a deadly sin on almost every street corner , and in every home , literally . and we tolerate it . because it 's common , it seems trivial , and we tolerate , all day long , morning , noon and night . not anymore . i 'm setting the example , and it 's going to be puzzled over and studied and followed , from now on .
murderers like you ?
a woman ...
murderers ?
innocent ? is that supposed to be funny ? look at the people i killed . an obese man , a disgusting man who could barely stand up ... who if you saw him on the street , you 'd point so your friends could mock him along with you . who if you saw him while you were eating , you would n't be able to finish your meal . after him i picked the lawyer . and , you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one . this was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster ... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets .
you only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off . that 's all .
you would n't because you know there are consequences . it 's in those eyes of yours , though ... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work . i wo n't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner . i only took their sins to logical conclusions .
now ... i would n't do something like that , johnny . i like you . i like you a lot .
i ... i doubt i enjoyed it any more than ... detective mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows . is n't that true ? how happy would it make you to hurt me , with impunity ?
oh , do n't worry . you wo n't ...
well , i 'll be standing beside you the whole time , so you be sure to let me know when this whole , complete reality thing is done . would n't want to miss it .
i ca n't wait for you to see . i ca n't wait ... it 's really going to be something .
it 's going to be flawless . people will barely be able to comprehend it . it will seem almost surreal ... but it will have a tangible reality , so they wo n't be able to deny it .
spit it out .
you ca n't see the whole ... the whole complete act yet . not yet . but , when this is done , it 's going to be ... so ... so ...
in two months , no one 's going to even remember this happened .
you know that 's not true .
i hate to burst your bubble , but other than the fact that you 're especially sadistic , there 's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours .
not me . i 'm not special . i 'm not exceptional . this is , though . what i 'm doing .
what makes you so special that people should pay attention ?
wanting people to pay attention , you ca n't just tap them on the shoulder . you have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer . then , you have their strict attention .
we 're not just going to pick up two more bodies , are we , johnny ? that would n't be ... shocking enough . would n't keep you on the front page of the newspapers .
you 'll see .
where we headed ?
put the gun down , somerset !
do n't do this ... please ...
put your gun down ! !
i ca n't let you do this ...
tell me it 's not true .
what did you say ?
throw your weapon , detective ! now !
what are you talking about ? what happened ?
throw your gun down now !
there 's no time to discuss it !
wait !
stay with him .
give me a break .
kiss me on the lips .
slut .
well , i have to tell you ... i think i 've fallen in love with you .
what is it ?
i will .
if john doe 's head splits open and a u.f.o . flies out , i want you to have expected it .
i can tell you this . i recognize his lawyer . his name 's mark swarr .
no .
he 's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece , right ? can you even conceive of what 's going to happen next ? i mean , can you even imagine how he 'll try to finish it ?
well ... what the fuck , man ?
you and i are , probably for the first time ever , in total agreement . he would n't just stop .
you know he 's fucking us .
when do we get to question him ?
because he is john doe , by choice .
big surprise .
as soon as this is over , i 'm gone .
no , actually , i was n't sure at all .
you knew i 'd say yes .
i 'm requesting you keep me on as your partner a few more days . you 'd be doing me the favor .
you think you 're doing me a big favor by staying ?
one of two things will happen . we 're either going to get john doe , or he 'll finish his series of seven , and this case will go on for years .
oh , you want to stay now ?
call for help , and you 'll live . but , you 'll be disfigured . or , put yourself out of your misery .
he cut her up and dressed the wounds .
that part of me is dead .
listen to yourself . you say , `` the problem with people is they do n't care , so i do n't care about people . '' but , you 're already here . you 've been here a long time . so , there 's a part of you that knows , even if everything you say is true , none of it matters .
no i 'm not ! i 'm talking about common , everyday life here . if you let yourself worry about one thing , you 'll worry about the next , and the next , and it never ends . in this place , ignorance is n't just bliss , it 's a matter of survival .
you 're talking about people who are mentally ill. you 're ...
wrong ! i sympathize completely , because if you ca n't win ... then , if you do n't ignore everything and everyone around you , you ... you become like john doe . it 's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it , because it takes so much work to love . you just have to make sure you do n't stop to think about the abuse , and the damage , because you 'll risk being sad . keep ignoring .
oh , you 're so much better than everyone , right ? no one 's worthy of you .
it was n't one thing , if that 's what you mean . i just ... i ca n't live here anymore . i ca n't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue .
what the fuck is wrong with you ? what burnt you out ?
people do n't want a champion . they just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers .
you think you 're preparing me for the hard times ahead ? you think you 're toughening me up ? well , you 're not ! you 're quitting , fine ... but i 'm staying .
why do n't you shut the fuck up for a while ? you bitch and complain ... if i thought like you , i would have slit my wrist already .
just know that in this case there 's not going to be any satisfaction . if we caught john doe and he were the devil himself , if it turned out he were actually satan , then , that might live up to our expectations . no human being could do these things , right ? but , this is not the devil . it 's just a man .
you follow the law and do the best you can . it 's all there .
where 's the victory ?
you do your job ...
you tell me , then ... you walk into an apartment , and a man has beaten his wife to death , or the wife murdered the husband , and you have to wash the blood off their children . you put the killer in jail . who won ?
you 're the oldest man i know , somerset .
do n't try to focus on things as black and white , because you 'll go blind . there 's no winning and losing here .
how can you say that ? especially after today ?
no . face it now . stop thinking it 's good guys against bad guys .
if we get him , i 'll be happy enough .
you know ... there 's not going to be a happy ending to this . it 's not possible anymore .
one birthday he gave me this brand new hardcover book , `` the century of the detective , '' by jurgen thorwald . it traced the history of deduction as a science , and it sealed my fate , because it was real , not fiction . and , that a drop of blood or a piece of hair could solve a crime ... it was incredible to me .
sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps .
the irony is , after a day of the type of work he did , he 'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories . murders in the rue morgue . le fanu 's green tea . my mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours .
these murders are his masterwork . his sermon to all of us . to all us sinners .
he 's preaching .
looking around ... i 've got a bad feeling these murders are his life 's work .
no dates indicated , placed on the shelves in no discernible order . it 's just his mind poured out on paper . i do n't think it 's going to give us any specifics .
`` what sick , ridiculous , puppets we are , and what a gross , little stage we dance on . what fun we have , dancing and fucking , not a care in the world . not knowing that we are nothing . we are not what was intended . ''
then , he must write about these murders .
well , there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room , and near as i can tell , each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages .
i 'm trying , alright ? just tell me what we 've got .
we could use about fifty more men here .
we had him .
what are you talking about ?
no point in arguing anymore ...
you stupid son of a ...
okay ... okay ... get off .
think it through . if we leave a hole like this , we 'll never prosecute . he 'll walk . we have to come up with some excuse for knocking on this door .
by the time we clear a warrant someone else is going to be dead .
think about how we got here !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
think about it ...
we have probable cause now .
we need a warrant .
the hell i ca n't ! we get in there and we can stop him .
you ca n't go in there .
it was him .
wait ... just wait .
what happened ?
i 'm fine .
are you alright ?
who told you about my silver tongue ? you been talking to my wife ?
you do the talking . put that old silver tongue of yours to work .
what are you going to say ?
sure . uh , excuse me ... are you by any chance a serial killer ? oh , you are ? well , come with us then , if it 's okay .
we 'll take a look at him . talk to him .
this is stupid . it 'd be just too easy .
that 's what it says . jonathan doe .
you 're sure you 're reading that right ? john doe ?
saint thomas aquinas . he wrote about the seven deadly sins .
the writings of saint thomas aqu ... aquin ...
that is .
the marquis de sade and origins of sadism .
it 's not what you think it is .
modern homicide investigation . in cold blood . of human bondage . human bondage ?
the divine comedy . a history of catholicism . a book called murderers and madmen .
i know , i know ... focusing on one little thing .
we 're focusing .
this is a waste of time .
i do n't . neither do you .
how do you know all about this ?
yeah , well ... at least we 're out of the office . we 've got pizza .
yeah . some college student who 's taking english 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on twentieth century crime .
if you want to know who 's been reading paradise lost , purgatory , and say ... the life and time of charlie manson , the bureau 's computer will tell you . it might give us a name .
so they ran our list .
legal ... illegal . these terms do n't apply . i do n't applaud it .
how is this legal ?
flagged books cover every topic the bureau deems questionable ... communism to violent crime .
you got to be kidding .
they monitor reading habits . not every book , but certain ones are flagged . books about ... let 's say , how to build a nuclear bomb , or maybe mein kampf . whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the f.b.i . from then on .
what ? assessing fines ?
for a long time , the f.b.i . 's been hooked into the library system , keeping accurate records .
him ?
it 's probably nothing , but even if it is , it 's no skin off our teeth . the man at hot dog world is a friend , in the bureau .
it 's be best if you got to the point , cause i 'm about ready to punch you in the face .
by telling you this , i 'm trusting you more than i trust most people .
let 's go .
well , that was money well spent .
i do n't know ... like fifty .
how much money do you have ?
what does all that matter anyway ? it 's not our job to figure him out , is it ? all we have to do is catching him .
just , realize ... this is not some common lunatic . the type of intestinal fortitude it must take ... to keep a man bound for a full year . to connect tubes to his genitals . to sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints . he 's methodical and exacting , and worst of all , he 's patient .
just because the bastard has a library card , it does n't make him einstein .
well , he 's been right so far , has n't he ?
and so what ?
this quote ... his first words to us . i looked it up . it 's from milton 's paradise lost . `` long is the way , and hard , that out of hell leads up to light ... ``
yes we do . here ...
we do n't know for sure ...
no . he 's not depending on luck . you 've seen that . we walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied victor to the bed , to the day . to the day ! because he wanted us to .
sooner or later his luck 's goning to run out .
no .
hey , freud , what brand of bullshit are you shoveling , huh ? right now he 's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy 's panties , singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter ...
it 's a fine line between insane and inspired .
oh , blah , blah , blah . the guy 's insane .
it 's too dismissive to call him a lunatic . we ca n't make that mistake .
there must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow . i mean , christ ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves .
this is the job . it 's not an easter egg hunt .
i 'm sick of sitting around , waiting for him to kill again .
who pays the rent on time .
a landlord 's dream tenant : a paralyzed man with no tongue .
victor 's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month . he says , quote , `` i never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one , and nobody ever complained about him . he 's the best tenant i 've ever had .
oh , it 's alright .
sorry about that ... i just ...
they pay cops for the inside scoop , and they pay well .
how do those cockroaches get here so quick ?
he 'll string us along all the way if we 're not careful .
i do n't know about you , but i feed off my emotions .
we have to divorce ourselves from emotions here . no matter how hard it is , we have to stay focused on the details .
no kidding ! no fucking kidding !
listen to me . he 's all about playing games .
i want him bad . i do n't just want to catch him anymore . i want to hurt him .
the way this has gone till now , i would n't have thought it was possible , but we may have underestimated this guy .
call an ambulance .
it is victor .
sounds like he knew what he was talking about .
i think hemingway wrote somewhere ... i ca n't remember where , but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this , you have to have the ability to kill . i think he meant you truly must be able to do it , not just faking it , too survive .
i expected it to be bad , you know . i took a human life ... but i slept like a baby that night . i never gave it a second thought .
how was it ?
i got him . i got the son-of-a-bitch . see , i was doing really good up till then . lots of street busts . i 've always had this weird luck ... everything always went my way , but this was wild . i got him with one shot ... right between the eyes . next thing i know , the mayor 's pinning a medal on me . picture in the paper , whole nine yards .
how did the fire fight end ?
it was my first one of these . we were a secondary unit , and i was pretty shaky going in . i was still considered a rookie .
and ?
never took a bullet . i pulled my gun once . fired it once .
never in my twenty-four years , knock on wood . i 've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it . never fired it though . not once . you ?
satisfy our curiosity ?
why would we ?
we 'll tag along .
yes . they were there ... so , it must be .
the fingerprints .
he does n't have the desire somehow . our killer seems to have more purpose . more purpose than victor could ever conceive of .
you tell me . i 'm new in town .
does n't seem like our man , does it ?
does this make it with you ?
in this city , if all the skeletons came out of all the closets ... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again , there 'd be no more room for the living .
i 've seen the same . i 'm not the country hick you seem to think i am .
i 'm , sorry , but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues . i 've seen so many corpses rolled away ... unrevenged .
bullshit .
we put it in a nice neat pile and file it away , on the slim chance it 's ever needed in a courtroom . it 's like collecting diamonds on a desert island . you keep them just in case you ever get rescued , but it 's a pretty big ocean out there .
oh , that 's all .
all we do is pick up the pieces . we take all the evidence , and all the pictures and samples . we write everything down and note what time things happened ...
then , you tell me what you think we 're doing .
i wish i still thought like you .
and you do n't ?
you meant what you said to mrs. gould , did n't you ? about catching this guy . you really want to believe that , do n't you ?
who the hell knows ? there 's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they do n't want to do . you know ... little voices tell them bad things .
it does n't fit . he does n't want us to help him stop .
he just may be nuts enough .
no .
just , honestly ... have you ever seen anything like this ... been involved in anything like this ?
just wait !
oh , yeah , sure . you got to be kidding ? !
bear with me .
what ?
we 're screwed . he 's fucking with us .
there must be something .
a switchblade .
what the fuck is that ?
it 's got to be .
nothing .
even if they did , those photos were taken before forensics .
you 're sure your men did n't move this ?
okay . but , what ?
what if it 's not that she 's seen something ? what if she 's supposed to see something , but she just has n't been given a chance to see it yet ?
i know .
this is the one thing .
none . which i do n't understand . he had to get back out .
no witnesses of any kind ?
totally unrelated victims .
nothing .
no fingerprints ?
like , because someone 's holding a gun on you .
attrition . when you regret your sins , but not because you love god .
forced what ?
for now , let 's just consider the books as the murderer 's inspiration . the books and sermons are about atonement for sin . and , these murders have been like forced attrition .
right . but there , pride comes first , not gluttony . the sins are in a different order .
seven terraces of purgation .
yeah . parts of them . anyway , in purgatory , dante and his buddy are climbing up that big mountain ... seeing all these other guys who sinned ...
did you read them ?
like in the parson 's tale , and dante .
the sins were used in medieval sermons . there were seven cardinal virtues , and then seven deadly sins , created as a learning tool , because they distract from true worship .
punishing .
he 's preaching .
we put her in a safe house .
and , if it 's a threat .
gould 's wife . she was away on business . if this means she saw anything , i do n't know what . we 've questioned her at least five times .
this is just to satisfy my curiosity . i 'm still leaving town saturday .
look , i appreciate being able to talk this out , but , uh ...
he must have left another puzzle piece .
he cut along the side of his stomach . the love handle .
all day saturday , and all day sunday . the murderer would want gould to take his time . to have to sit there and decide . where do you make the first cut ? there 's a gun in your face ... but , what part of your body is expendable ?
the leather chair was soaked through with sweat .
well , his body was found monday night , okay ? but , get this ... the office was closed all day monday . which means , as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend , our killer could 've gotten in here on friday . he could 've spent all day saturday with gould , and all day sunday .
i 'm certain . he was the biggest defense lawyer around . infamous , actually .
our guy got into office , probably before the building closed and security tightened up . gould must have been working late .
i vaguely recall a large , angry man , and someone called norton .
you 've never seen `` the odd couple ? '' this is sick . `` the honeymooners ? ! ''
i just have to say , i ca n't respect any man who 's never seen `` green acres . ''
i read . remember reading ?
you go to movies at least ?
what about them ?
what about sports ?
all television does is teach children that it 's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day .
hello .
i 'd like you to meet somerset .
tonight .
how 's that ?
i 'm invited to have a late supper at your house . and , i accept .
well ?
what ?
it 's my wife .
detective mills here . honey ... i asked you not to call me here . i 'll call you back ... what ? why ?
it 's a package deal . you get the phone with the office .
can we talk about this in private ?
it 's too soon for him .
whoa , whoa ... what ? !
i 'm declining this case . i want us reassigned .
this is a premeditated puzzle , and it 's only the beginning .
this is his stuff . i 've been out in the cold all day .
this was one sadistic motherfucker .
he ate his fill , and was forced to continue eating ... till his body rejected the food . the killer held a bucket under him , and then kept serving . he took his time . the coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours . the victim 's throat was swollen from the effort , and there was probably a point where he passed out . that 's when killer kicked him in the stomach . popped him .
but , why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing ? it must have been intentional .
it could be nothing .
you always have to find one singular thing to focus on . there 's always one thing , and it may be as small as a speck of dust , but you find it and focus ... till it 's an exhausted possibility .
this does n't make any sense .
have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink ? near the food ?
same color and texture .
i just do n't think we should have that sort of relationship . we 'd start quarreling over insignificant things .
okay ... sure ... it 's just that , with my old partner , you know ...
is that clear ?
yeah , well , all i want is ... just , just do n't be jerking me off . that 's all i ask . do n't jerk me off .
i made a decision , because i have to consider the integrity of the scene . i ca n't worry whether you think you 're getting enough time on the playing field .
the badge in my pocket says `` detective , '' same as yours .
good .
anyway ... i did my time on door-to-doors , and walking a beat . i did all that shit for a long time .
no .
you 've seen my files , right ? seen the things i 've done ?
guessing at this point is useless .
you think it was poison ?
i do n't know . feel free to look for yourself , okay ?
is there any blood in it ?
it 's a bucket of vomit .
there 's a bucket . under the table .
what ?
there 's a bucket here .
please be quiet for a while , would you ?
when we found him , he was lying there with a knife in his back , so what else could it be but homicide ? except , i finally figured out ... he held the knife behind him ... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall ... then he shoved his body backwards ...
then , why are we wasting our time ? this guy 's heart 's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham . if this is n't a coronary , i do n't know what is .
no one yet .
who said this was murder ?
for now .
drop it .
and i wonder how many times officer davis there has found a dead man who was n't really dead until davis was in the car calling it in and eating a donut .
i wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into ?
well , over the next seven days , do me the favor of remembering it .
i realize that .
not here .
i was n't standing around guarding the local taco bell . i 've worked homicide for five and a half years .
let me tell you how i want this to go . i want you to look , and i want you to listen .
maybe i thought i could do more good here than there . i do n't know . look , it 'd be great by me if we did n't start right off kicking each other in the balls . but , you 're calling the shots , lieutenant , so ... however you want it to go .
it 's very simple . you worked a nice , quiet town , but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it . i 've just never seen it done that way before , detective .
maybe i 'm not understanding the question .
you just met me .
i 'm here for the same reasons as you , i guess . or , at least , the same reasons you used to have for being here before ... before you decided to ... quit .
all this effort you 've made to get transferred , it 's the first question that pops into my head .
i ... i do n't follow .
i meant to ask you something , mills , when we spoke on the phone . i ca n't help wondering ... why here ?
i need to start getting the feel of it all , right ? meet the people .
actually , if it 's all the same , i 'd like to get to the precinct house a.s.a.p . seeing how we do n't have much time for this whole transition thing .
since we 're just starting out , i thought we could go to a bar ... sit and talk for awhile . after that , we 'll ...
i 'm a little thrown . i just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here .
why is this painting hanging upside-down ?
what ?
this painting ...
i ca n't do this now ... please .
are you absolutely certain ?
i do n't see anything .
anything ... anything missing or different .
please , i need you to help me if we 're going to get who did this .
i do n't know why ... why now ?
i need you to look at each one carefully ... very carefully . look for anything that seems strange or out of place . anything at all .
i ... i do n't understand .
i 'm sorry about this , mrs. gould . i really am .
i can tell you now , i know ... i 'm positive i made the right decision . i 'm positive . but , there 's never a day that passes that i do n't wish i had decided differently .
i want to have children . it 's just ...
well , i got up one morning and went to work ... just like any other day , except it was my first since hearing about the baby . and , i ... i felt this fear and anxiety washing over me . i looked around , and i thought , how can we raise a child surrounded by all this ? how can a child grow up here ? so , that night , i told her i did n't want us to have it , and over the next few weeks , i convinced her it was wrong . i mean ... i wore her down , slowly .
i hate this city .
oh , tracy ... i have to tell you , i 'm not the one to talk to about this .
i do n't know ...
you should look into private schools .
i 've been going to some of the schools , looking for work , but the conditions here are ... horrible .
he mentioned it .
i ca n't be a burden , especially now . i know i 'll get used to things . i guess i wanted to know what someone who 's lived here thinks . upstate , it was a completely different environment . i do n't know if david told you , but i teach fifth grade , or did .
talk to him about it . he 'll understand if you tell him how you feel .
i do n't know why i asked you to come .
you have to put blinders on sometimes . most times .
perfect example .
i 'm sorry , i only ...
i feel strange being here with you ... without david knowing .
i do n't sleep very well .
it 's a hard place .
i mean , you known this city . you 've been here for so long .
if you can , please call me . please . i have to go now ... goodnight .
i do n't know , with this case .
too long . what do you think so far ?
how long have you lived here ?
any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me ... disagreeable . just ask your husband .
it surprises me . it really does .
i was close once . it just did n't happen .
i guess i wo n't be showing it to him then .
you have a strange way about you ... i mean interesting . i 'm sorry . it 's really none of my business . it 's just nice to meet a man who talks like that . if david saw that paper , he 'd say you 're a fag . that 's how he is .
no matter how often i see guns , i still ca n't get used to them .
do n't worry . i do n't wear it at the dinner table .
really ?
high school and college , yes . pretty hokey , huh ? i knew on our first date this was the man i was going to marry . god ... he was the funniest man i 'd ever met .
i hear you and mills were high school sweethearts .
what ? oh , yes . i mean , thank you . please , sit down .
it smells good .
it 's a nice name . william , i 'd like you to meet david . david ... william .
oh ... um , william .
it 's nice to meet you . my husband has told me a lot about you ... except your first name .
i do n't know .
did their son see it happen ?
this is a done deal . all but the paperwork .
yes . look at all the passion splattered up on the wall here .
crime of passion .
why always like this ? only after the fact ... this sudden realization , that if you shoot someone , or stick a knife in them , that person will cease to exist .
when the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together . she was crying too hard to say anything .
did the wife confess ?
neighbors heard them screaming at each other for like two hours . it was nothing new . but , then they heard the gun go off . both barrels .
do n't argue ! ... and stay close ... maybe they 're rustlers ... and maybe this dodderin ' old idiot ai n't so far wrong ...
now , ethan , i ai n't sure ...
you 're my brother ... you 're welcome to stay as long as you got a mind to ... ai n't that so , martha ?
you askin ' me to clear out now ?
they gave up ... went back to the cotton rows ... so 'd the jamisons ... without martha , i do n't know ... she would n't let a man quit .
passed the todd place comin ' in ... what happened to 'em ?
it just happened to be me ... no need to make any more of it ...
it was ethan found you squallin ' in a sage clump after your folks was massacred ...
that old goat still creakin ' around ? ... why n't someone bury him ?
but mose harper said ...
how should i know ?
how 's california ?
i wish uncle ethan was here . do n't you , ma ?
what , ben ?
it 's all right , ma ... i been watchin ' ... only i wish ...
it 's not a sword , ma ... it 's a sabre ! did you kill many damyankees with this sabre , uncle ethan ?
not tonight ... ben , put that sword back .
that 's enough ... go on inside and help lucy set the table ... you , too , deborah !
an ' she 's got a beau ! kisses him , too !
lucy 's going on seventeen now ...
what you saw was a buck wearin ' lucy 's dress ... i found lucy back there in that canyon ... i wrapped her in my blanket an ' buried her with m'own hands ... i thought it best to keep it from you -- long as i could .
it was , i tell you !
what you saw was n't lucy .
huh ... ? no ... no water .
why 'd they break off ? was there water in that canyon ?
that 'll be the day ! ... let 's ride .
you 've said that enough ! ... maybe lucy 's dead ... maybe they 're both dead ... but if i hear it from you again , i 'll fight ya , mr. edwards !
naw ... a human man rides a horse till it dies ... then he goes on afoot ... a comanche comes along ... gets that horse up ... and rides it twenty more miles ... then he eats it .
they got to stop < u > sometime < /u > ... if they 're human at all , they got to stop !
why do n't you finish the job ?
let 's get along ...
stealing the cattle was just to pull us out ... this here 's a murder raid ... it shapes up to scald out either your place ... or my brother 's .
killed every one -- an ' not for food either ... why 'd they do a thing like that ?
i ai n't wearing no gun .
it 's all right ... charlie , let 's move outside .
and other things ... mebbe you thought you was gettin ' away with being comical about that indian wife you took ... i bet she was n't the first squaw you ...
if you 're talkin ' about that crazy murder charge ...
what right you got to be talkin ' marriage to any decent woman ...
as to that , i do n't know , charlie ... we had n't got around to talkin ' marriage ...
she sure is ! ... an ' do n't think your comin ' back is goin ' to change it !
< u > charlie < /u > < u > maccorry < /u > ! ... you were n't fixin ' to marry him ? ?
yes sir ...
ethan , you an ' martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay ... charlie , hightail it to head- quarters an ' spread the word ...
now , now ... let 's not grow dis- putatious ...
you 're goin ' if the captain says you 're goin ' ...
well , go get cleaned up and we 'll proceed with the weddin ' ...
dunno ... seems so .
you all right , sergeant ?
in that case , give the boys room ...
no sir ... pleasure .
is this in the line of duty , sergeant ?
well , that 's seven we can score up to your brother , ethan .
this 'un come a long way 'fore he died .
another one , eh ?
go ahead , son ... but at the first alarm , we 're comin ' in -- and we ai n't goin ' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do ...
i say no !
now mount up , son ...
i did n't < u > want < /u > to tell you ... but maybe it 's your right to know .
there sure is ! i 'm going to tell you somethin ' ... i was n't going to speak of it ... but i 'll tell you now . did you notice them scalps strung on scar 's lance ? did you see the third scalp from the point of the lance ? long ... wavy hair ...
now son , it 's a bitter thing to say , but there 's more than your sister at stake here .
enough to go around ... i 'd say about a dozen apiece ... mount 'em up !
how many , would you say ?
we can get within 500 yards ... there 's a hogback to the south .
< u > captain < /u > ... nope , would n't say that ... likely you had your reasons for killin ' futterman ... probably needed killin ' ... i 'm speaking as a ranger now , not as a reverend ... fact that all three was shot in the back is the only thing that 's raised some question -- that and a missin ' gold piece known to have been on him just prior to his demise .
this an invite to a necktie party , reverend ?
i got to ask you and martin to ride to the state capitol with me , ethan .
comanches do n't use their fists , reverend ... let 'em alone ...
fight fair , son ... use your fists !
came here for a wedding , ethan ... until that 's over , i reckon 'reverend ' will do ...
evenin ' ... evenin ' reverend ... or do i call you 'captain ' ... ?
you got one now !
that 's all right , captain ... i do n't need any formal invitation to kill a comanch ...
i did n't give any order to fire !
how far 's the river from here , mose ?
if you were tryin ' to surround 'em , you sure succeeded .
just keep goin ' ...
you got any more orders , captain ?
yes , sir ... but if you 're wrong , < u > captain < /u > clayton , do n't ever give me another !
... as you have of findin ' those girls alive by ridin ' into 'em ... i say we do it my way , ethan ... and that 's an order !
what do you know about it ? ... what 's a quarter-breed cherokee know about the comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him ... you got as much chance of stampedin ' their herd as ...
i thought we were trying to get the girls back -- < u > alive < /u > ... we jump those comanches , they 'll kill 'em ... you know that !
it 's what we 're here for , ai n't it ?
you 're right sure you want to < u > jump < /u > 'em , ethan ?
they 're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here . soon 's it gets dark we 'll circle out so 's to jump 'em before day- break .
by what you preach ... none !
what good does that do ?
... like a flower and is cut down ... < u > amen < /u > !
amen ! ... put an 'amen ' to it !
he cometh forth like a ...
i figger a man 's only good for one oath at a time ... i took mine to the confederate states of america ... so did you , reverend ...
you fit a lot of descriptions .
got a warrant ?
i 'm askin ' as a ranger of the sovereign state of texas .
you askin ' as a reverend or a captain , sam ?
why ? you wanted for a crime , ethan ?
you can forget that ... would n't be legal anyway .
well , swear him out again ! ... i 'll go with you .
he sure < u > is < /u > goin ' ... he 's sworn in .
you ai n't goin ' ...
i do n't believe in surrenderin ' ... i still got my sabre , reverend ... never turned it into any ploughshare neither !
have n't seen you since the surrender . come to think of it , i did n't see you < u > at < /u > the surrender .
yes , sir ...
all right ... but keep your eye on me , boy ... i 'm the hard case you 're up against here -- not these childish savages ... if you do n't hear me first time i holler , you better read my mind ... i do n't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand ...
but he knows that , sir ... ca n't i stay , sir ?
god forbid ... no , son , you flog on back and tell your pa where we 're at ... and where he 's at ...
if there 's anything i can do , sir ...
well you found me ... good work , son ... good work .
yes , sir ... troop 's about ten miles back ... the colonel sent me looking for you ...
never mind ... your pa know you 're out here ?
sir ?
go on ! why n't you have your bugler sound the charge while you 're at it ? ?
captain clayton ... captain !
what in ... ?
sonny , yonder 's a passel of murderers , complete with texican scalps an ' white girl captive ... you want to protect us , you just get out of our way ... now < u > skedaddle < /u > !
but ... but captain , we ca n't possibly take the field tomorrow ... for your own protection ...
you tell your pa a company of rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an ' equipped will be in the field by daylight ... headin ' for the south end of the malapai . if he can catch up with us , well an ' good ...
yesterday , one of our patrols picked up a man claims he was a prisoner with scar till only two days ago ... he talks crazy but i brought him along ... says he lives here ... keeps mentioning a rocking chair .
and what makes you think he 's in this territory ?
yes sir ... we 've received information about a band of comanches under a chief named scar ...
joint action ?
my pa wants to know ... < u > colonel < /u > < u > greenhill < /u > wants to know how soon you could put a company of your rangers in the field , fully armed and equipped , for joint punitive action against the comanches .
oh ... now what 's this your pa wants to know ?
why colonel greenhill is colonel greenhill , sir ... commanding officer , fifth u.s. cavalry ... i 'm lieutenant greenhill , sir .
hold on , son ... who 's this colonel greenhill you 're talking about ?
colonel greenhill 's compliments , sir . the colonel wishes to know how soon you could put a company of rangers in the field , fully armed and ...
i 'm clayton .
is captain clayton here , reverend ?
these are my people ... unnt-meah ! go ! go ! < u > please < /u > !
i 've come now ...
i remember ... from always ... at first i prayed to you ... come and get me ... take me home ... you did n't come ...
debbie , think back ! i 'm martin ... remember ? remember how i used to let you ride my horse ? tell you stories ? do n't you remember me , debbie ?
you lie ! all white men lie ... and kill ...
no debbie ! that ai n't what happened ! they been lyin ' to you ...

i do n't care what they 've done to you ... what happened ...
we ai n't goin ' ! we ai n't goin ' without you , debbie ... ethan , get the horses ... i 'll try to keep her talkin ' ...
unnt-meah !
grab hold ! ...
martin ! ride me as far as the well !
seven fingers ... ay-eh ... seven ...
scar ! where 's he holed in ?
ay-eh ... made out i was crazy ... ate dirt ... chewed grass ... i fooled 'em , ethan ! ... an ' i got away ...
mose ... try to remember ! ... you were in scar 's camp ...
where 's scar , mose ... scar ?

ethan ... i found a man 's seen her ... knows where little debbie is !

you help me find her , you got your rockin ' chair ...
do n't want no money , ethan ... jus ' a place -- a roof over m ' head ... a little grub ... a bunk to sleep in ... an ' a rockin ' chair by the fire ... my own rockin ' chair by a fire ...
well , the reward still stands ...
you were born old ...
ai n't been too good ... no sir , not too good ... gettin ' old , ethan ...
leggo my arm ... you look mangier 'n ever .
ay-eh ... that 's jest what i tole joe powers ... that un 's gettin ' kinda sassy , ai n't he , ethan ?
steady , daniel boone ! you do n't want to miss ... it makes them think their medicine 's stronger than yours ...
sure ! ... they < u > were < /u > here ... now they 're out there ... an ' waitin ' to jump us ! ...
ay-eh ... they was here ...
ai n't yours yet .
do n't forget to come back with my thousand dollars .
in that case you wo n't find her -- and i wo n't get my thousand dollars .
and maybe you lie ...
scar 's band was headin ' north ... to winter in at fort wingate ... eatin ' agency beef . that 's what this buck said ... maybe he lied .
keep talking .
me neither ... but this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the nawyecky comanches .
scar ? never heard of any chief scar .
a young buck fetched it in late last summer ... said it belonged to a captive chile of chief scar ...
talk !
you got it with you ?
that 's what i said .
you said there 'd be a thousand dollar reward .
how 'd you come by this ?
that 'll be the day ... 'as we developed the village ' ... next time you develop a village , hit it where the fightin ' men are ... you wo n't get any headlines for killin ' squaws .
keefer ! ..put this man under arrest !
are you sure they did n't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o ' yank bluebellies so scared they could n't tell the difference between a cheyenne and a comanche ?
well ... i know there were some captives recovered ...
my name 's edwards ... i 'm looking for my niece ... she was in that camp when you attacked ...
that camp you hit was nawyecka comanche ... chief scar 's bunch ...
i beg your pardon ?
< u > cheyenne < /u > ! what cheyenne ?
sir -- we charged ! ..gentlemen -- and i hope you will quote me -- i can not say too much for the courage of the men who followed me into that cheyenne camp ...
you do n't remember it , but i remember . that was your mother 's scalp !
i saw it ... and do n't try to tell me it was aunt martha 's or lucy 's ...
she 's alive ... better she 's alive and livin ' with comanches than her brains bashed out ...
livin ' with comanches ai n't bein ' alive ...
i know you are ... only it ai n't goin ' to be that way ... she 's alive ...
it 's what i 'm countin ' on .
wait ! we go chargin ' in , they 'll kill her ... and you know it .
what 's goin ' on ?
what 's that got to do with us ?
she 's been with the bucks ! she 's nothin ' now but a ...
you can keep your will ! i ai n't forgettin ' you was all set to shoot her yourself ... what kind o ' man are you , anyway .
not no more .
'i , ethan edwards , being of sound mind and without any blood kin , do hereby bequeath all my property of any kind to martin pauley ... ' i do n't want your property ... . 'sides , what do you mean no 'blood kin ? ' debbie 's your blood kin ...
we wo n't be here ... come on !
they 'll be back ...
over there !
go on ! get out of here while you can ...
debbie , you 're comin ' with us ! hear me ?
how ? she 's even forgot her own language !
i do n't know ... somethin ' tied his hands ... maybe hospitality ...
why did n't he make his move back there ?
he 's got to ... all these years , run- nin ' , dodgin ' , knowin ' we were after him ... now we caught up ... it 's him or us .
you figger scar means to kill us ?
not likely .
stay out here .
cicatriz is mex for < u > scar < /u > ... an ' he has a white girl in his tepee ... be seein ' you ...
never heard of him ...
suit yourself ... while you 're enjoyin ' your little conversation , i 'll be ridin ' out with senor fernandez here ... the comanch ' medicine country ai n't far ... there 's one camp with a chief named cicatriz .
you breeds are all alike -- two drinks an ' ...
lem me alone ...
i ai n't sure ... where 's that doll ?
no ... she 's not ...
what 'd the soldiers have to kill her for ! ..
well , you 're a widower now ...
ai n't that too bad ... if you feel that sorry for your kinfolk , i 'm surprised you did n't take up with that squaw wife of yours ...
peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo , too ... .
least , < u > they < /u > wo n't feed any comanches this winter ... killin ' buffalo 's as good as killin ' injuns in this country .
what 's the sense in it !
nine ... ten !
ethan , quit it !
yeah , i kinda figgered you 'd say that ... bein ' a new husband and all ...
i think maybe we oughta ...
how should < u > i < /u > know ... she 's your wife !
think she means for us to follow ?
she ai n't goin ' back to her family , that 's certain ... not if she took off where the arrow points .
beats me how she could get that pony out o ' camp without neither of us hearin ' a thing ...
look ! scar ? ... do you know where he went ? and if he has a girl with him ... a < u > white < /u > girl -- nai-bist pabo taibo ...
you ask her !
look ?
says her name 's wild goose flying in the night sky ... but she 'll answer to look since it pleases ya ...
cut it out , will ya ...
that 's the way to train 'em . looks like mrs. pauley 's goin ' to make you a fine beautiful wife ...
and have her whole family after our scalps for floutin ' one o ' their women ? ... no sir ! come on , mrs. pauley ...
oh no ! tell her she 's got to go back ...
you got yourself a < u > wife < /u > , sonny !
what ?
< u > you < /u > do n't understand , ya chunkhead ! < u > you < /u > did n't buy any blanket ! ya bought < u > her < /u > !
think it might be ... ?
what i heard back there was that a band o ' hostile nawyeckas came through this way less'n two weeks ago ...

whatchu doin ' ? ...
he just could n't wait ...
futterman ?

oh ...
sorta like 'roundabout ' -- like a man says he 's goin ' one place when he means to go just the reverse ...
what 's that ?
not so funny ... if you recollect what 'nawyecka ' means ...
maybe i 'm gettin ' like mose harper -- my bones is cold tonight ...
hey ! what 's the idea ... ?
good night .
yeah ... you want me to know i ai n't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man 's clothes to wear ! ..you tole me that already ... now shut your head !
martin ... i want you to know some- thin ' ...

all right ... i ai n't got no kin ... i 'm goin ' to keep lookin ' that 's all .
that do n't make 'em kin ...
i always felt like she was ... her folks takin ' me in , raisin ' me like one of their own ...
she 's your nothin ' ... she 's no kin to you at all !
because she 's my ... my ...
why ?
i ai n't stayin ' ... i set out lookin ' for debbie ... i aim to keep on ...
he 's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while i 'm gone ... i 'll be pushin ' on tomorrow ...
your cattle ? ... < u > debbie 's < /u > cattle !
jorgensen 's been runnin ' his cattle with my own ...
good night ...
good night ... laurie ...
an injun will chase a thing til he thinks he 's chased it enough ... then he quits ... same when he runs ... seems he never learns there 's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin ' on ... so we 'll find them in the end , i promise you that ... we 'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth .
and you think we got a chance to find her ?
no ... our turnin ' back do n't change anything ... not in the long run . if she 's alive , she 's safe ... for a while ... they 'll keep her to raise as one of their own , 'til she 's of an age to ...
say it . we 're beat !
get some sleep ... tomorrow 's another day ...
what you goin ' to do ?
must 've ... anyway , i ai n't goin ' back to look for it ...
say ! ... what happened to your blanket ? lose it ?
huh ... ? sure i 'm all right ...
you all right , ethan ?
no ... nor build bonfires ... nor beat drums neither . i 'll meet you on the far side .
you want us to fire a shot if ...
they 're with 'em -- if they 're still alive .
sorry ... we do n't even know if debbie 'n lucy are with this bunch ... maybe they split up ...
easy on that !
if they 're still alive ...
why , sure , ethan ... there 's just the one thing we 're after ... finding deborah and lucy ...
all right ... but i 'm givin ' the orders ... you take 'em or we split up here and now ...
leggo ...
nothing for you to see .
easy ! it 's forty miles , sonny ... horses can do with some grain and a little rest .
well , come on !
well , fust off ...
name 's ethan ... now what 's so mighty fishy about this trail ?
what you want me to call you ?
do n't have to call me 'sir ' neither ... nor grampaw neither ... nor methuselah neither ... i can whup you to a frazzle .
yes , sir .
stop callin ' me 'uncle ' ... i ai n't your uncle .
somethin ' mighty fishy about this trail , uncle ethan ...
you 've done a lot of growin ' ...
not quite ... quarter cherokee . the rest is welsh ... so they tell me .
time 's running out ... but i 'm obliged to you .
that 's the breed ... course it might take time .
comancheros ...
there 's one thing . we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp ... cheap stuff ... trade goods ... could n't help noticing that most of it was mexican ... maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border ... what do they call themselves ?
well , we only got the one lead -- scar ... and where we begin to look , i do n't know ...
they 're not white any more -- they 're < u > comanche < /u > ! ... let 's see the bodies ...
hard to realize they 're white , is n't it ...
not far from it ...
was your niece about their age ?
i 've seen her ... and she 's alive .
you 've seen her ! ... she 's alive ?
she 's not a little girl any more .
no ... not yet ...
yes ! ..yes , i remember ! ..have they found her , ethan ?
you ever see it before ... like mebbe on a dress debbie wore ?
why it 's just a snip of calico ...
do n't go blamin ' yourself ...
i got your boy killed .
well , you did all a body could , ethan .
i am ... i am ... it 's just that i know martha 'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls ... and if the girls are ... dead ... ethan , do n't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance !
i 'd be obliged if you 'd get to the point , ma'am .
yours truly ... and he even has to write his full name ... martin pauley ... not even just < u > martie < /u > ! ... i do n't care if he < u > never < /u > comes back !
they never find that girl .
a little comanche squaw - squaw !
every young man should at least once ... go on , laurie ! read !
that means mister futterman is dead , by golly .
the < u > late < /u > mister futterman ?
dear miss laury ... i take pen in hand to let you know ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them com- anches the late mister futterman told us about ...
who cares what he spells it ? read the letter .
'dear miss laury ' ... he spells it with a y instead of an i ... e ... would n't you think he 'd know ...
from the beginning ...
oh , all right ! well ... martin says ...
only if i 'm dead !
do you know what ethan will do if he has a chance ? ... he 'll put a bullet in her brain ! and i tell you martha would want him to !
< u > laurie < /u > ! shut your mouth !
fetch < u > what < /u > home ? ... the leavin 's of comanche bucks -- sold time an ' again to the highest bidder ? ... with savage brats of her own , most like ? ...
i got to fetch her home ...
it 's too late ... she 's a woman grown now ...
you crazy ?
martie ... do n't go ! not this time .
you do and i 'll die , martie ... i will ! i 'll just die !
do n't cry , laurie ... i understand how it is ... i 'll just go 'way ...
it is n't fair ...
but i allus loved you ... you know that , without my sayin ' it ... i could n't bring myself to ask you to wait ... the little i had ... not knowin ' how much longer until we found debbie ...
no , it was n't ... you mighta said you loved me ... you mighta asked me to wait ... at least that 'd have been something ...
it was n't much of a letter ...
one letter in five years ... i read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out ...
i ... i wrote you a letter ... reckon you did n't get it ...
i ca n't help it , laurie ... i just got ta catch up with ethan ...
take it and welcome ... but do n't count on finding me here when you get back ... i 've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin ' for you ... i ai n't cut out to be an old maid !
but that 's sweet-face -- your own good horse .
go on then ! pa 's in the barn saddlin ' the fort worth stud ... an ' you can take the light gelding with the blaze ...
i got ta catch up with him , laurie !
finish your breakfast ...
futterman ! ... he 's got a little tradin ' post on the south fork o ' the brazos ... laurie , i just got to get me a good horse ! think yer pa would ...
shush ! ... time for bed anyway ... likely these 'll need some takin ' in ... oh , martie , you 're that gaunted ! ... ma 's havin ' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and ...
might at least have left me my pants !
would n't bother me ... i would n't try it in front of pa , though , was i you ...
you talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid ...
i 'm a woman , martie ... we wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives ... when you 're little we even wash < u > you < /u > ... .how a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman i 'll never know ...
well i ai n't one of 'em !
what you gettin ' red-in-the-face for ? ... i have brothers , have n't i ?
ai n't worth the mendin ' ...
do n't go takin ' that stuff ...
sorry ... keep the column moving ! ..close ranks there !
but could n't you ... ?
you 'll have to wait until we reach the agency ... fall in behind the column ...
where ?
we got two around that age ...
she 'd be about thirteen now ...
you do n't remember ?
for god 's sake , what happened to me ?
i would n't have made it by myself .
how did you get me out of there ?
i have a yearning for ... smog , cars and many , many people ... a real dirty ... big city . what do you think ?
what ?
... so he 's dictating you a new bestseller ? whatever that is , it 's not our son .
you know , tommi wants me to become the man i used to be .
your book - that 's why you were always in the cellar !
it 's important - he knows the last chapter .
'he ' ? whom do you mean-
i told you , there is no way out . he wo n't let you go .
we loved each other once . have you forgotten that ?
oh , ellen . my sweet ellen ... of course i knew .
what are you talking about-
of course you 'll give me the blame again . like back then . just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - is n't that right , ellen ?
martin , damnit , what are you up to ? let go of me !
you know what i have to do now , and believe me : i do n't enjoy doing this .
it 's simply too dangerous here ! but no , you always have to have it your way .
martin , what-
damn it , look at you ! do n't you see what 's happening with you ? we need to get out of here , do n't you understand ? out of this house !
will you finally cut it out ? just in case you have n't noticed , i am trying to write a book here . and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it 's a pretty tough job . so why ca n't you just leave me alone ?
okay , so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors . `` there is something negative about the place ... '' what the hell are you trying to say ? come on ! spit it out !
this house , the whole damned area around here is one mass grave ... now you might call me crazy , but there is something negative about the place .
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner . what 's your point ?
hi , darling .
let me guess : another short circuit ?
an animal ? what kind of animal ? a goddamned t-rex , or what ?
maybe an animal .
old ? ! come look at this ! she has wounds . wounds on her head . like thrashes . or bites .
she was old .
look at this ! the dog ! she 's dead !
what ?
i have n't the slightest idea .
who 's that ?
the house - tommi - something just does n't jive here ...
what ? what am i supposed to sense ?
it 's just a feeling . do n't you sense it , too ?
ellen , what are you trying to prove , anyway ? that we 've created ourselves a ghost ? come on !
`` events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals ... ''
in the village . look what i found .
where have you been ?
oh , baloney . you should just hear yourself talk !
but that 's not the point ! what if all these things are somehow connected ?
i went to see prof. roth ! you know , i had another one of those dreams last night . i saw tommi !
where have you been all day ?
why not ? she can guard the house . by the way , i gave her a name : clara .
do n't tell me you 've made friends with that wandering flea circus ?
no , thanks . i have everything i need . drive safely , you hear ?
hey , you 're still here . i suppose you like it here with us .
yeah ... i have to go to town .
so , did you sleep good ?
come on , at least try one . it took me two hours to make these .
now , what did i do to deserve this ?
come on , this is n't about honesty . you just need a good night 's sleep . the way you toss and turn all night , even i hardly get any sleep .
well , apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you . do n't you remember what we promised to each other ? honesty - trust !
you know , it 's not always easy for me , either . but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis .
martin , it 's not funny !
someone from the village .
who was that ?
if we stand a chance at all , it 's only by sticking together .
maybe different . i do n't know , ellen .
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before ?
so do i , believe me .
i miss tommi so much .
and two months later , we got married . and all because of one sentence : `` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
i was so excited about meeting you . again and again , i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you .
not a book fair . i was signing autographs in a department store .
cherry-red tears , your first book . i read it at least nine times . and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair .
what ?
cherry-red tears .
we just have to make a new beginning .
i have a funny feeling . do you think we 'll get over all that 's happened ?
hey , take your time . you know time heals better than any shrink ever can .
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it .
i just had a really strange experience .
is everything alright ? are n't you feeling well ?
making our very own solstice fire .
what are you doing ?
well , if you wo n't let me smoke grass , then at least i 'll go get myself some cigarettes .
where are you going ?
yes , daddy .
hey , flower child , the sixties are over . and this stuff is hazardous to your health .
my father was a pilot . and do i know how to fly ?
my father was an electrician . already forgot that ?
you ?
i 'll do it myself .
do you have a better idea ?
are you crazy ? that costs a fortune !
we 'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning .
look at this ! we 'll have to fix the whole wiring . this stuff is dangerous as hell .
in the cellar , i think . wait , i 'll take care of it .
do you know where fuse box is ?
oh , damnit !
hey ... the fuse .
we 're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity ! damned box !
maybe the antenna 's broken .
oh , that was upstairs . a real antiquity ! i think it 's great .
i mean the armchair !
it still worked in town .
what kind of a horrible thing is that ?
well then , i guess i 'd better leave the two of you alone . but do n't forget ...
oh , the muse ... we 're still having our differences . you know how it is with women .
me and the muse , of course . how is your book coming along ?
they say it 's fantastic . at least that 's what i read in a men 's magazine . so who are the two lucky ones ?
so , how does it feel to be kissed by two women ?
you 'll never get away from me !
stop that !
oh god , tommi ...
ellen , move aside ...
what else should i do , damn it , he 's dying !
you 're not a doctor , you 'll hurt him !
i have to cut his windpipe ...
`` with you , my life began and with you shall it end ... ''
say it anyway . come on , how much do you love me ?
come on , say it . you know ...
why else ?
i do n't know all about what happened back then . but it always stood between me and my husband .
but what is the truth ?
that 's alright . do n't misunderstand my husband . it 's only that he 's already had enough problems with this case . and who would believe him if he told the truth ?
thank you . elisabeth , i did n't mean to ...
frank kosinski . here 's the address . go see him . ask him .
oh no , no . you 're not bothering him . he has lots of time since he 's been retired .
i really hate to bother him , but ...
thank you .
oh , ellen ! i 've been wondering when you 'd come . why do n't you step in .
you 're doing fine , are n't you ? i mean ... the two of you alone in that house , so far out in the moor .
ellen .
i appreciate your concern , but we live in that house . i need to know what happened in there .
do yourself a favor : do n't ask .
1976. what happened back then ?
you know , after doing that job for so many years , you learn to appreciate the simple things in life . flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life . but certainly , you 're not here to chat about my hobbies .
wait , wo n't you join me for a cup of coffee ?
i guess it 's too lonely for most folks . it 's time for me to get going . it 's been a pleasure meeting you .
village gossip . you 're a real attraction here .
do i look like it that much ?
it 's a pleasure . you 're from the city , right ?
ellen straub .
you know , i saw him sitting outside your gate ... oh , i 'm sorry , i 'm forgetting my manners again ! i have n't even introduced myself yet . hi , my name 's lindner . karl lindner .
no , i 've never seen him before .
does this dog here belong to you ?
hello . can i help you ?
we can do all of that later , but first you need to calm down .
it all went so fast . he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver . i only wanted to defend myself . you have to call the police ...
i think i 've killed him . martin , my husband , i 've killed him ! that is , i 'm not sure , but ...
what ?
i 've killed my husband !
mrs. straub !
a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and , thus , influence your perception .
and that is ?
there is , of course , another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case .
listen , it 's one thing to have a guilt complex . but i know the difference between when i 'm overstrung and when i 'm seeing things that are simply not there ! besides , it only began after we moved !
how could i fail to notice that ! - i have to go ...
hammer ?
yes , something was ...
peculiar ? you mean , like back then ?
i think it 's starting again . you know ... there was something peculiar . if only i knew ...
well , it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it .
we should leave the past alone .
you did n't tell her !
excuse us . but do stop by for a visit sometime ! you are welcome anytime .
stop scaring people . let 's go . we need to be on our way .
just call me elisabeth .
oh , mrs. straub . may i introduce you to my wife ?
not so bad , if i could get some peace and quiet around here .
hey , my man ! how 's the masterpiece coming along ?
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place . you can afford to spend some money . if i was you , i 'd spare myself all the hard work . besides , did n't you want to start writing again ?
twenty-three , to be exact .
i guess someone lost their key . you did get your tetanus shots , i hope ?
look at this . the lock is totally demolished .
very funny .
tenth floor .
damn , this thing is heavy . where do you want to have it ?
ladies and gentlemen : the `` straub country-residence '' .
well , look here !
he was the first man among us . a great light has gone out .
ohwhat have i done ?
and you are a warwickshire shit-house .
you are a gentleman .
thank you , ned .
romeo and juliet -- just a suggestion .
ah
the title wo n't do .
oh
it 's good .
nedi knowi know
the speech is excellent . `` oh , then i see queen mab hath been with you ! '' excellent and a good length . but then he disappears for the length of a bible .
you did not like the speech ?
locked safe in here . i leave the scene in your safe keeping , ned , i have a sonnet to write .
willwhere is mercutio ?
mercutio
and the title of this piece ?
we are in desperate want of a mercutio , ned , a young nobleman of verona
viola de lesseps . known her since she was this high . would n't deceive a child .
lady ?
thank you , my lady !
writer , is he ?
oh , thomas ! she has cut my strings ! i am unmanned , unmended , and unmade , like a puppet in a box .
sir robert de lesseps .
do you know that house ?
i had the christopher marlowe in my boat once .
really ?
yes , i 've seen you in something . that one about a king .
yes .
i know your face . are you an actor ?
right you are , governor !
follow that boat !
treachery !
you did . but ned alleyn and the admiral 's men have the playing of it as the rose .
i gave shakespeare two sovereigns for romeo !
well , i am to deptford now , i leave my respects , miss rosaline .
never !
romeo ? -- he gave it to henslowe .
what is money to me like us ? besides , if i need a play , i have another waiting , a comedy by shakespeare .
twenty pounds on delivery
wait ! will you desist !
then tomorrow you will have the pages .
tomorrow .
you have the money ?
you have the last act ?
my massacre at paris is complete .
what do you want , kit ?
see you in jail .
we will all be put in the clink .
no juliet ? !
we have no juliet !
ask him .
and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you ?
the queen has commanded , she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us .
burbage , i will see you hanged for a pickpocket .
done .
here is two sovereigns -- i 'll give you two more when you show me the pages .
ned is wrong for it .
i swear it . he wants romeo for ned and the admiral 's men .
you 're a liar .
ten pounds .
how much ?
it 's for henslowe . he paid me .
i will play him . bring it tomorrow .
romeo
the title ?
romeo . wit , swordsman , lover .
what is the chief part ?
a comedy . all but done , a pirate comedy , wonderful .
are you writing ?
when i have fifty pounds .
not from me . i only stole it . when are you coming over to the chamberlain 's men ?
i am still owed money for this play , burbage .
there is no dog in the first scene , will kempe , thank you . how goes it will ?
the woman who wears the snake will dream of you , and your gift will return . words will flow like a river . i will see you in a week .
will it restore my gift ?
yet can not love nor write it .
so now you are free to love
four years and a hundred miles away in stratford . a cold bed too , since the twins were born . banishment was a blessing .
no , your marriage bed .
on my mother 's side the ardens
and your relations ?
she had a cottage . one day , she was three months gone with child , so
a woman of property ?
no , no . you have a wife , children
a goodly length in times past , but lately
how long has it been ?
tell me , are you lately humbled in the act of love ?
it is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring .
most interesting .
nothing comes .
interesting .
i have lost my gift . it 's as if my quill is broken . as if the organ of the imagination has dried up . as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed .
i am here to help you . tell me in your own words .
aye , now and again , but what of it ? i have lost my gift .
black sue , fat phoebe , rosaline , burbage 's seamstress ; aphrodite , who does it behind the dog and
and yet you tell me you lie with women ?
words , words , wordsonce , i had the gifti could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires , love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstonesfor sixpence a line , i could cause a riot in a nunnerybut now
and buys a deadly poison . he enters the tomb to say farewell to juliet who lies there cold as death . he drinks the poison . he dies by her side . and then she wakes and sees him dead .
that 's me .
i have not said all . by malign fate , the message goes astray which would tell romeo of the friar 's plan . he hears only that juliet is dead . and thus he goes to the apothecary .
by heaven , i thank you ! i will be your apothecary !
mr. fennyman , because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play . i am writing an apothecary , a small but vital role .
of course , it was mighty writing . there is no one like marlowe
yes , i saw it .
i saw his tamburlaine , you know . wonderful .
who is that ?
gentlemen ! thank you ! you are welcome .
sad and wonderful ! i have a blue velvet cap which will do well , i have seen apothecary with a cap just so .
well , that will have them rolling in the aisles .
the apothecary ? will , what is the story ? where is the shipwreck ? how does the comedy end ?
mr. shakespeare has given me the part of the apothecary !
henslowe , you pound of tripe , in my business i would be out of business if i had your courage , so do n't tell me about business
i want no more trouble , mr. fennyman . as i explained to you , the theatre business
yes , but very well .
but nothing is happening .
very well .
is it going well ?
oh , it 's coming , it 's coming .
where is the play ?
i do n't know . it 's a mystery .
how ?
nothing . strangely enough , it all turns out well .
so what do we do ?
mr. fennyman , let me explain about the theatre business . the natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster . believe me , to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre .
by order of the master of the revels !
oh , that .
the theatres are all closed by the plague !
what have i done , mr. fennyman ?
this time we take your boots off !
without doubt he is completing it at this very moment .
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughteralmost finished ?
mr. fennyman , i think you may have hit on something .
of course not !
there 's never any
a share of the profits .
but i have to pay the actors and the authors .
good title .
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter .
what 's the title ?
it 's a crowd-tickler -- mistaken identities , a shipwreck , a pirate king , a bit with a dog , and love triumphant .
partners !
and a share . we will be partners , mr. fennyman !
and his ears .
a new comedy . by will shakespeare !
cut his nose off .
it 's a comedy .
put his feet in .
i have a wonderful new play !
take his feet out . where will you get
two weeks , three at the most , aaaagh ! for pity 's sake .
when ?
every word .
do you know it ?
thomas kent !
who are you ?
what happened to sam ?
it will be all right , madam .
no juliet ? !
i am so sorry , mr. henslowe . i wanted to be an actor . i am sorry , will .
it is over .
nobody knew !
ned , i swear i knew nothing of this !
i do n't know . it 's a mystery .
how will it ?
juliet does not come on for twenty pages . it will be all right .
go on .
the show must you know
what do we do now ?
another little problem .
i do n't know , it 's a mystery .
how will it ?
no , it will turn out well .
we are lost .
by god , will , if you do not , who does ? let us have pirates , clowns , and a happy ending , or we will send you back to stratford to your wife !
by god , i wish i knew .
god 's teeth , am i to suffer this constant stream of interruption ? ! what will you do in act two when he meets the love of his life ?
juliet ? you mean ethel .
what ?
the one who came with your letter ?
romeo .
what ? who ?
cut round him for now .
you want to know what parts you are to receive . all will be settled as we go
it is customary to make a little speech on the first day . it does no harm and authors like it .
we are about to embark on a great voyage .
nobody . the author .
we are at least four acts short , will , if you are looking for disaster .
we are at least six men short , and those we have will be overparted , ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews . my romeo has let me down . i see disaster .
tomorrow
well , i to my work , you to yours . when can i see pages ?
i did not .
my tailor . wants to be an actor . i have a few debts here and there . well , that seems to be everybody . did you see a romeo ?
yes . nearly . it 's all locked safe in here . we need ralph for the pirate king . good morning , master nol . you will have a nice little part .
will ! have you finished ?
rosaline ? you mean ethel .
romeo and rosaline . scene one ! god , i 'm good !
is it about a pirate 's daughter ?
i feel a scene coming on .
to the palace at whitehall .
now where ? will ?
to my weekly confession .
where are you going ?
no , then .
cut out my heart ! throw my liver to the dogs !
burbage offers me a partnership in the chamberlain 's men . for fifty pounds my hired player days are over .
fifty pounds ? what for ?
mr. henslowe , will you lend me fifty pounds ?
half what you owed me . i am still due for one gentleman of verona .
nobody ! you are writing it for me ! i gave you three pounds a month since .
who wrote that ?
no -- it 's comedy they want , will ! comedy ! like romeo and ethel ?
what piece ? richard crookback ?
well , i am a dead man and buggered to boot . my theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks , my company is playing the inn-yards of england , while burbage and the chamberlain 's men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece , written for my theatre , by my writer , at my risk when you were green and grateful -
henslowe , you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate ?
aphrodite baggot who does it behind the dog and trumpet ?
she is always aphrodite .
who is she this time ? !
as soon as i have found my muse
god be praised ! locked ?
it is all locked safe in here
no , no , we have n't the time . talk prose . where is my play ?
doubt that the stars are fire , doubt that the sun doth move
will ! where is my play ? tell me you have it nearly done ! tell me you have it started . you have begun ?
a different one you have n't written ?
this is a different one .
i thought your play was for burbage .
good luck with yours , kit .
mercutiogood name .
his best friend is killed in a duel by ethel 's brother or something . his name is mercutio .
the daughter of his enemy .
the daughter of his enemy .
do you think ?
ethel .
yes , that 's good . until he meets
romeo isitalian . always in and out of love .
well , there 's a pirate in truth , i have not written a word .
what is the story ?
romeo and ethel the pirate 's daughter . yes , i know .
and yours ?
good title .
i have a new one nearly done , and better . the massacre at paris .
i love your early work . `` was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium ? ''
not new -- my doctor faustus .
i hear you have a new play for the curtain .
i insist -- and a beaker for mr. marlowe . the barman does the business .
i have . and chinks to show for it .
burbage says you have a play .
wonderful , wonderful .
how goes it , will ?
kit
`` out of her favour where i am in love . ''
`` of love ? ''
`` out . ''
`` not having that which , having , makes them short . ''
it was . what sadness lengthens romeo 's hours ? ''
`` ay me , sad hours seem long . was that my father that went hence so fast ? ''
`` but new struck nine . ''
`` is the day so young ? ''
`` good morrow , cousin . ''
thank you . let go , there 's a good nurse .
god bless you !
i will .
be good to her , my lord !
will you ask her majesty to be patient ? !
be patient , my lord , she is dressing .
not ready ? where is she ?
it would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master .
it would be better that you return tomorrow , my lord .
piety is for sunday ! and two hours at prayer is not piety , it is self- importance !
lady viola is pious , my lord .
two hours at prayer !
you will not tell . as you love me and as i love you , you will bind my breast and buy me a boy 's wig !
my lady , this play will end badly . i will tell .
oh , nurse ! he would give thomas kent the life of viola de lesseps 's dreaming .
he looks well enough for a mountebank .
from tomorrow , away in the country for three weeks ! is master shakespeare not handsome ?
your mother , and your father
a comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of romeo to be the very same capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king !
verona again .
he sees himself in me ! romeo montague , a young man of verona .
but i would be valentine and silvia too . good nurse , god save you and good night . i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players .
as a nurse .
no . . . not the artful postures of love , but love that over- throws life . unbiddable , ungovernable , like a riot in the heart , and nothing to be done , come ruin or rapture . love like there has never been in a play . i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .
like valentine and silvia ?
all the men at court are without poetry . if they look at me they see my father 's fortune . i will have poetry in my life . and adventure . and love . love above all .
well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so . lord wessex was looking at you tonight .
i am not so well-born .
playhouses are not for well-born ladies .
be still .
but at the playhouse . nurse ?
when the queen commands it .
but silvia i did not care for much . his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons . stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats ! oh , when can we see another ?
i liked the dog , for laughs .
did you like proteus or valentine best ? proteus for speaking , valentine for looks .
oh , but they can !
but playwrights teach nothing about love , they make it pretty , they make it comical , or they make it lust . they can not make it true .
above lord wessex ?
and i love poetry above all .
and -- ?
they are not acted for you , they are acted for me .
i love theatre . to have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
speak out ! i know who i am . do you love stories of kings and queens ? feats of arms ? or is it courtly love ?
your majesty
what do you love so much ?
your majesty .
i have seen you . you are the one who comes to all the plays -- at whitehall , at richmond .
stand up straight , girl .
your majesty .
give it to master kent . he will see it rightfully home . wessex gives his purse to viola .
fifty shillings . pounds .
lord wessex , as i foretold , has lost his wife in the play- house -- go make your farewell and send her out . it 's time to settle accounts . how much was the wager ?
as stories must when love 's denied -- with tears and a journey . those whom god has joined in marriage , not even i can put asunder .
indeed i am a bride short . how is this to end ?
why , lord wessex ! lost your wife so soon ?
your majesty !
there was a wager , i rememberas to whether a play can show the very truth and nature of love . i think you lost it today . you are an eager boy . did you like the play ?
your majesty
by and by i come to cease thy strife and leave me to my grief . a thousand times good night ! ''
`` madam ! ''
`` i come , anon -- but if thou meanest not well , i do beseech thee -- ''
`` madam ! ''
`` all my fortunes at thy foot i 'll lay , and follow thee my lord throughout the world . ''
`` go ask his name -- if he be married , my grave is like to be my wedding bed . ''
`` i know not . ''
i would have made you immortal . tell burbage he has lost a new play by will shakespeare .
will !
burbage has my keeping but you have my heart .
are you to be my muse , rosaline ?
you left it in my bed . come to look for it again .
i have lost my gift .
when will you write me a sonnet , will ?
`` parting is such sweet sorrow ''
sam ! do me a speech , do me a line .
it is not my fault , master shakespeare . i could do it yesterday .
luck be with you , sam . sam ?
master shakespeare
master henslowe , you have your actors .
no , no , a touch of cold only . we suspect he is lying but will has turned away .
but your voice have they dropped ?
i am , master shakespeare .
mr. pope ! mr. phillips ! welcome , george bryan ! james armitage ! sam ! my pretty one ! are you ready to fall in love again ?
`` the exchange of thy love 's faithful vow for mine . ''
`` what satisfaction can'st thou have tonight ? ''
`` o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''
i have night 's cloak to hide me from their eyes ; and but thou love me , let them find me here .
i would not for the world !
`` she speaks .
`` ay me . ''
`` the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp . her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night . see how she leans her cheek upon her hand . o that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek .
`` sin from my lips ? oh trespass sweetly urg 'd . give me my sin again . ''
`` then have my lips the sin that they have took . ''
`` thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purg 'd . ''
`` oh then , dear saint , let lips do what hands to : they pray : grant thou , lest faith turn to despair . ''
`` ay pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer . ''
`` have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ? ''
i like her .
as any mule in christendom . but if you are the man to rider her , their are rubies in the saddlebag .
is she obedient ?
she will breed . if she do not , send her back .
my plantations in virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg . i have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a wessex . is she fertile ?
she is a beauty , my lord , as would take a king to church for a dowry of a nutmeg .
yes , i know . but he was always hanging around the house .
but the plague
i have , master shakespeare .
you have opened the playhouses ?
what does burbage care of that ? he is readying the curtain for kit marlowe .
so this is the favour you find in the chamberlain 's men .
like you , i found him not at home !
i have to get back .
wait , you 'll see the cat bites his head off .
oh . what is your name ?
i like it when they cut heads off . and the daughter mutilated with knives .
you admire it ?
i was in a play . they cut my head off in titus andronicus . when i write plays , they will be like titus .
better fortune , boy .
i 'll be damned if you are !
i am ethel , sir , the pirate 's daughter .
who are you , master ?
write me well .
good bye , my love , a thousand times good bye .
nor you for me .
you will never age for me , nor fade , nor die .
i do n't know . it 's a mystery
how does it ?
but all ends well .
and thus unable to declare her love
but fearful of her virtue , she comes to him dressed as a boy
orsinogood name
at sea , then -- a voyage to a new world ? she lands upon a vast and empty shore . she is brought to the dukeorsino .
sold in marriage and half way to america .
an excellent beginning let him bea duke . and your heroine ?
a comedy ! what will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom , sick with love ?
the queen commands a comedy , will for twelfth night .
if my hurt is to be that you will write no more , then i shall be the sorrier .
i have hurt you and i am sorry for it .
it was we ourselves did that . and for my life to come i would not have it otherwise .
i am done with theatre . the playhouse is for dreamers . look where the dream has brought us .
a hired player no longer . fifty pounds , will , for the poet of true love .
`` i have more care to stay than will to go . come death , and welcome . juliet wills it so . how is't my soul ? let 's talk . it is not day . ''
`` thou need'st not to be gone . ''
`` it was the lark , the herald of the morn , no nightingale . look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east . night 's candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops . i must be gone and live , or stay and die . ''
`` wilt thou be gone ? it is not yet near day > it was the nightingale and not the lark that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear . nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree . believe me , love , it was the nightingale . ''
will you read it for me ?
but i will go to wessex as a widow from these vows , as solemn as they are unsanctified .
nono .
if not wessex the queen will know the cause and there will be no more will shakespeare .
you can not marry wessex !
you were not dead before . when i thought you dead , i did not care about all the plays that will never come , only that i would never see your face . i saw our end , and it will come .
oh , my love you ran from me before .
i love you , will , beyond poetry .
i was the more deceived .
calf love . i loved the writer , and gave up the prize for a sonnet .
my love is no lie . i have a wife , yes , and i can not marry the daughter of sir robert de lesseps . it needed no wife come from stratford to tell you that . and yet you let me come to your bed .
you lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed .
you lie .
he was not dead before . i would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come .
you never spoke so well of him .
marlowe 's touch was in my titus andronicus and my henry vi was a house built on his foundations .
a literary feud . quite normal .
will ! what -- ?
stage fighting ! oh , will ! as thomas kent my heart belongs to you but as viola the river divides us , and i will marry wessex a week from saturday .
i know how to fight !
you can not , wessex will kill you
then i will go with you .
you follow your desire freely enough in the night . so , if that is all , to greenwich i go .
to be the wife of a poor player ? -- can i wish that for lady viola , except in my dreams ? and yet i would , if i were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day .
what will you have me do ? marry you instead ?
you can not ! not for the queen herself !
yes , this is not life , will . this is a stolen season .
in heaven , perhaps . it is not a comedy i am writing now . a broad river divides my lovers -- family , duty , fate -- as unchangeable as nature .
oh , but it will end well for love ?
i found something in my sleep . the friar who married them will take up their destinies .
oh , but it is mine too !
that 's my line !
`` good night , good night . as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast . o wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ? ''
yes , some of it is speakable .
oh , will !
i must . i must
oh , do not go
it was the owl . believe me , love , it was the owl .
it is broad day ! the rooster tells us so !
there is time . it is still dark .
oh -- no , no !
let him be damned for his pages !
mr. henslowe ?
oh , let henslowe wait .
it was the owl -- come to bed
no , the morning rooster woke me .
moonlight !
i must . look -- how pale the window .
you would not leave me ?
well perhaps better than my first .
and that was only my first try .
oh
even your play .
there is .
i would not have thought it . there is something better than a play .
it is strange to me , too .
i do not know how to undress a man .
then kiss me again for i am not mistook .
i am .
answer me only this : are you the author of the plays of william shakespeare ?
wait ! you are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as i was mistook in thomas kent .
can you love a player ?
can you love a fool ?
oh , not for the world !
you can bring them with a word .
if they find you here they will kill you .
oh my lady , my love !
oh -- i am him too !
alas indeed , for i thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart .
a lowly player .
oh but why `` alas ? ''
the same , alas .
anon , good nurse . anon . master shakespeare ? !
will shakespeare !
who is there ?
my lady !
killed last night , in a tavern ! come , then , we 'll say a prayer for his soul
he is dead ?
oh ! -- dear god , i did not think it would be me to tell you . a great loss to playwriting , and to dancing .
mourning ? who is dead , my lord ?
and on a day of mourning . i never met the fellow but once at your house .
it is to be expected on a sunday .
i understand of course . it is to be expected .
i am going to church .
bless me , i thought it was a horse .
it is not my riding day , my lord .
you look sad , my lady ! let me take you riding .
lady viola isyoung in the world . your majesty is wise in it . nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting . i 'll wager my fortune .
i meanyour majesty , they do not , they have not , but i believe there is one who can
ah ! my lady ! the tide waits for no man , but i swear it would wait for you !
good morning , my lord !
i will do my duty , my lord .
she wants to inspect you . at greenwich , come sunday . be submissive , modest , grateful and brief .
the queen has consented ?
will you defy your father and your queen ?
it was your eyes . no , your lips .
but why me ?
why , yes ! my fortune lies in my plantations . the tobacco weed . i need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work -- i fancy tobacco has a future . we will not stay there long , three or four years . . .
virginia ? !
how your mind hops about ! your father was a shopkeeper , your children will bear arms , and i will recover my fortune . that is the only matter under discussion today . you will like virginia .
i do not love you , my lord .
your father should keep you better informed . he has bought me for you . he returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from saturday . you are allowed to show your pleasure .
do you intend to marry , my lord ?
no . i have spoken to the queen . her majesty 's consent is requisite when a wessex takes a wife , and once gained , her consent is her command .
you flatter , my lord .
i am aware of it , but it is beauty 's privilege .
lord wessex . you have been waiting .
my lady viola .
so my lord ? i speak with him every day .
i have spoken with your father .
my lord .
my lady viola .
it is , thomas , but of good reputation . come , there is no harm in a drink .
oh ! -- it 's -- it 's -- oh , it 's a house of ill- repute !
for one kiss , i would defy a thousand wessexes !
but what of lord wessex ?
yes , by god ! love knows nothing of rank or riverbank ! it will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king , and their love should be minded by each , for love denied blights the soul we owe to god ! so tell my lady , william shakespeare waits for her in the garden !
i think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance . for what lady could live up to it close to , when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine ? besides , can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a bankside poet and player ?
oh thomas , a pair of pippins ! as round and rare as golden apples !
what of her bosom ?
constantly . without doubt . and plays the lute , she has a natural ear . and her bosom -- did i mention her bosom ?
she sings too ?
deeper . softer . none of your twittering larks ! i would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song .
and her voice ? like lark song ?
oh , thomas , her lips ! the early morning rose would wither on the branch , if it could feel envy !
and her lips ?
oh , if i could write the beauty of her eyes ! i was born to look in them and know myself .
yes , like rain and sun , like cold and heat . is your lady beautiful ? since i came to visit from the country , i have not seen her close . tell me , is she beautiful ?
like a sickness and its cure together .
yes , my aunt . but perhaps she wept a little . tell me how you love her , will .
your aunt ?
i her letter came to me by the nurse .
no . and yet she does where the ink has run with tears . was she weeping when she gave you this ?
does she say so ?
she loves me , thomas !
it is only ours you can know .
and break her heart and mine ?
if you love her , you must do what she asks .
she tells me to keep away . she is to marry lord wessex . what should i do ?
of course you have not ! i have not written it !
i am very sorry , sir , i have not seen act two .
he is speaking about a baggage we never even meet ! what will be left in your purse when he meets his juliet ?
no , sir .
do you understand me ?
yes , sir .
let me see you . take off your hat .
are you mr. shakespeare ?
wait there .
i . . .
where did you learn how to do that ?
my hat ?
take off your hat .
thomas kent . i would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player .
your name ?
by god , i 'll fight the lot of you
you are on my ground .
you upstart inky pup ! now i will show you your place , which is in hell !
that dog !
marlowe ? oh yes , he is the one , lovely waistcoat , shame about the poetry .
an insolent penny-a-page rogue , marlowe , he said , christopher marlowe -- has he been to the house ?
a theatre poet ?
there was a man , poet -- a theatre poet , i heard -- does he come to the house ?
a man , my lord ?
is there a man ?
oh , my lord , you will not shake me off , she never needed me more , i sear by your breeches !
on a more fortuitous occasion , perhaps
her chaperone . my lady 's country cousin . my , but you be a handsome gallant , just as she said ! you may call me miss wilhelmina !
are you bringing your laundry woman ?
here we come at last , my lord !
christopher marlowe at your service .
by coveting my property . i can not shed blood in her house but i will cut your throat anon . you have a name ?
how do i offend , my lord ?
i was a poet till now , but i have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the tower .
`` poet ? ''
your idea ? well , that fits . i mean , the two of you , that fits together . i should have seen that long ago .
i bought the tickets . one for her and one for me . it was my idea .
what ?
where will we go ? where will we go ? juliet ?
where do you think you 'll go ?
it 's very kind of you to offer , but --
about the mail --
no , ca n't think of anything else that matters .
but more laughter than tears , i think ? yes . on balance ? i mean , remember that time when -- oh , we could talk all night , but we have to go . do n't we , juliet ?
yeah ?
i mean , we 've had ups and downs , right -- good times , bad times ?
not at all .
for the best . exactly . i would n't want things to end on a downer .
oh , no , no , no . do n't let it worry you . not at all . it 's probably for the best .
no , really , i am sorry , sorry to be ducking out on you like this . i hope you wo n't take it personally .
it 's all right . i 'll forward your mail .
yeah , i 'm sorry , but that 's the way it is .
so i gathered .
you old devil . well , anyway , as you can see , we 're leaving .
yeah , i was phoning your mother .
sex lines ? is that it ? triple x-rated interactive fantasy ? old habits die hard .
except the money .
they know ? so what ? they have nothing , there is nothing , to connect us to that bodies stuff .
they know .
they can know all they like , it wo n't do them the slightest bit of good --
but they know .
i beg your pardon ?
i 'm glad you 're so certain , alex . it makes us feel a whole lot better .
it does n't neccessarily matter . they do n't even know who those people are , and even if they did , they have nothing to connect them with us , nothing at all .
it was n't deep enough . i told you it was n't deep enough , but you would n't listen .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
your friends .
who ?
we just wanted to speak to you .
what for ? what did you want ? the money ? was that it ?
looking for you ? yes .
you looking for me ?
secure it ? what do you mean -- you 're gong to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank ? you 're not going to take it to a bank or what , you want to bury it ? is that it ?
i want to secure it .
if you give me the plate , i 'll eat .
not eating like you used to , that 's what .
not eating what ?
you 're not eating .
nothing .
what 's wrong ?
no , i 'm sure , that 'll be enough .
you 're sure ? there 's lots more .
what ? yes , that 's fine .
oh , that 'll come in useful .
i fitted a lock up there . on the inside .
what 's all this for , more security ?
no , it does n't . i tried to let it worry me but it wo n't . i 've worked on that paper for three years . there is a pensioner 's terror ordeal on page six every day . every day . maybe when i 'm a pensioner it 'll worry me .
does n't it worry you ?
downstairs , i know . pensioner 's terror ordeal : page six .
there was a break-in .
from what ? jehovah 's witnesses ?
security .
what is this ?
i do n't know .
how much ?
i do n't know .
how much did you pay ?
i do n't know .
how much did you pay ?
you think so ?
yeah , but you were good , you were really good . fucking bin-bag ' , i liked that . you were good . you explored your maleness to the full there .
anyway , what i was wanting to say was this --
good luck . i love that guy , but why does he have to follow us around ?
after .
now .
after you drink to love and happiness forever .
i want to talk now .
what 's the problem ?
just stop worrying .
listen , it 's important . we need to talk about what we 're going to do --
not now . i have an idea .
can we talk about something ?
that was good .
yes . now come on , all or nothing .
is this necessary ?
do n't you worry about that .
is that going to be deep enough ?
but not quite .
finished .
look , if i draw the short straw , then i 'll do it , but i 'm not going to do it just because you wo n't .
i do n't know .
take his legs .
i just thought we should discuss it .
family ? family ? friends ? drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups do n't have families , david .
i 'm just telling you i ca n't cut him up .
you 're telling me you want out ? already ? you 're telling me you do n't want the money ? hugo is going off . he smells . the flat smells . we ca n't wait any longer .
i wo n't be able to .
i do n't hear this .
i ca n't do it .
we all are , david , we 're all going to do it . each of us , you , me and juliet , will do his or her bit . is that fair enough ?
you know what . who 's going to do it .
do i ? what ? what ? what are you talking about ?
you know what i 'm talking about .
then what ? who 's going to do what ?
no , not that .
dig the pit , i do n't know .
so who 's going to do it ?
a spade , we need a spade -- i wish you would concentrate -- we need a spade if we 're going to dig a pit .
now what else ? david i do n't know .
and what about you ?
you call them if you want .
when are you going to let the police know ?
he could n't get his car started .
he 's still here .
all right , then , go ahead , telephone . telephone the police . try again . no one 's going to stand in your way . go ahead . tell them there 's a suitcase of money and you do n't want it .
you think so ?
but do n't tell me that you 're not tempted by it . do n't tell me that you 're not interested . i know you well enough .
it 's asick idea , alex . it 's sick .
i 'm only asking you both to think about it .
you mean immoral .
juliet ?
no .
come on , david .
no .
think about it .
no .
can i show you something ?
i saw my grandmother , of course , but i do n't suppose that counts . i mean , she was alive at the time .
no .
yes or no , yes or no , yes or --
alex , i do n't have the time --
have you seen him ?
no , she 's not in . without waiting for any more , he replaces the reciever and walks to the door , where he picks up the mail . on his way back from the door , david emerges , ready to go to work .
it 's true . a newspaper is paying for all this . a newspaper ...
only on expenses .
why , thank you , david .
he made it clear .
i do n't have time to discuss it now . i do n't care so long as he 's not a freak .
i 'm only asking what you think .
i do n't have time .
about this guy , this hugo person .
about what ?
what do you think ?
discussion group , alex , discussion .
you learn that in your psychotherapy group ?
victory is the same as defeat . it 's giving in to destructive competitive urges .
i do n't want to devalue your victory , but i just want you to know : i was n't trying to win .
i have n't lost yet .
you 're a bad loser .
will you shut up and play .
chess . chess is often used as well .
what ?
in the same fashion as chess .
just serve .
i was trying to educate you .
serve .
squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination .
with which of the following figures do you most closely identify : joan of arc , eva braun or marilyn monroe ?
turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no , this is important . leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing ?
or maybe just phone out for a pizza ?
do a little freebasemaybe , from time to time ?
i 'd like to ask you about your hobbies .
all right , just a few questions .
i do n't know -- campbell or something ?
what 's his name ?
well , i 've got this story , it 's really good , i 'm working on , that is good , i feel it could be big , it this , eh , and it 's , you know , it 's incredible . am i right , did you say beyond recognition ' ?
do n't know what ?
i do n't know .
animals involved ? i know , but you need a change . and besides , we 're short .
but there 's no --
well ?
cover it ?
of course you do n't know anything about it . if you knew anything about it , i would n't have to send you over there to cover it .
i do n't know anything about it .
out in the woods . three bodies . decomposed . mutilated . beyond recognition .
tell you what . if you do remember seeing any of these guys , maybe you could give me a phone , on this number , any time you like .
right .
i see .
what ? uh , no , no , it 's a fake . i picked it up in thailand . the second hand does n't sweep , you see .
yes .
just one thing .
oh , no problems . do n't worry .
sorry to waste your time .
that 's all ?
that 's it , then .
no , not any more . i just wondered if it would surprise you .
parked outside ?
what ?
well , is it ?
yes , i suppose so .
and if i told you their car was parked outside , would that surprise you ?
i do n't know them .
take another look at these two .
i 've never seen any of these men before .
well , then ?
no . why should it ?
that 's because he is . does that upset you ?
it looks like he 's writing everything down .
what does it look like ?
are you recording it ?
this is just an informal discussion .
is this being recorded ?
nothing . we thought you were someone else .
what ?
so tell me , cameron , what on earth -- just tell me , because i want to know -- what on earth could make you think that we would want to share a flat like this with someone like you ?
well , yes .
spacious , quiet , bright , well appointed , all that sort of stuff , all that crap .
yes .
yes . it is , is n't it ? we alllike it . and the room 's nice too , do n't you think ?
oh , yes , it 's great .
and you like it ?
yes .
good . well , you 've seen the flat ?
yes , thanks .
well , cameron , are you comfortable ?
what ?
that 's right .
let him go . let him take it all .
stop him , alex . you 've got to stop him .
no .
do n't you ever stop ?
do n't worry about it . i 'd do exactly the same , but i do n't think i 'm his type .
you must n't take it so badly .
the perfect couple , i should say .
it 's about me and david .
that 's what i thought he said .
it makes us feel a whole lot better .
oh , shut up , alex .
of course , but i think you 'll find the print medium provides a more lucid and detailed --
we were just sorting things out .
i do n't know . i thought maybe i was --
yes , of course . why would n't i be ?
are you all right ?
as smart as you are , you 'll need a little help .
what ?
alex .
everything . except maybe that it was his idea and not mine in the first place . ok ? that 's important to me . i need to die misunderstood .
everything .
and if it sounds like i 'm being killed , you 'll phone the police , you 'll tell them everything ?
i 'll wait there .
you 'll wait in the hall ?
no , i 'm not frightened . a little terrified maybe . did you see what happened to the last two who tried that ? they went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference , i mean , alive dead dead alive , that sort of thing . it was n't difficult to spot . he killed them both : he cut them up .
you 're frightened .
i refuse .
it 's the only way .
no , definitely not . and that 's that . i refuse to discuss it further .
well , i 'm not expecting anyone either .
are n't you going to answer it ?
oh .
no .
expecting anyone ?
forget it -- he 'll come down .
now you thought of that , not me .
where he ca n't get it ?
we could put it somewhere .
and the money ?
he is n't safe up there . if you really cared about him , you 'd use your influence to get him down , then he 'd be safe .
forget it .
he wo n't do anything for me , but for you --
oh , good .
exactly . now i 've been thinking --
david ?
later . but first -- him .
your painful groin ?
we have to talk .
what are you doing here ?
boy , am i glad to see you .
looking after it -- he 's probably fucking well eating it .
no , but he 's looking after the money , so what 's the problem ?
yeah , he 's got to go to work , has n't he ? you think he 'll come down for that ?
he 'll come down . leave him alone .
he ca n't stay up there .
leave him alone .
because that 's no good . remember , we did what we did , we took the money . it was a material calculation . but what 's the use if it 's underground , or in some funny bank in some funny place ? if you ca n't spend it , if you ca n't have it , what use is it ? none . it 's nothing , all for nothing , if you do that . i did n't get into this for nothing , so that i could have nothing --
i do n't see the point in that .
do n't you ?
you know we 're right .
be like a weight off your shoulders .
once it 's spent you wo n't have to worry about it .
he 's right . you 'd feel much better about it .
you know , you should spend some of that money instead of worrying about it . that 's my advice .
i do n't want it to taste different . i do n't know why i bother . is that enough for you ? hey !
it tastes different .
i hope it tastes better than the other stuff .
no , no , it 's different .
is this the same stuff you made last week ?
yeah , you 're making us all nervous .
will you calm down .
then let 's spend some money .
no .
are you all right ?
do n't know . no one said anything . alex rendered speechless with desire . i recall that feeling , from the days when i had such a thing .
who was it ?
hello . hello .
you were magnificent .
well , you certainly had a good look around .
yes , it is . it 's him . cameron , cameron , come on over.yo !
that 's not him .
what 's he doing here ?
no , i do n't .
cameron . you remember cameron .
who ?
look over there . it 's cameron .
it 's not for me . it 's for love and happiness forever .
david , i promise we will . keep him happy .
for ever and ever .
love and happiness for ever .
i want my money back . excuse me .
sshh .
i do n't know why we could n't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being . we could have hid it in the fridge .
stop nagging .
yeah , we do n't want another stiff on our hands . do n't fall through the ceiling . ok ? is he listening to me ?
be careful .
david ?
ok .
whoever draws the short straw does it all . that way , you either do it or you do n't . all or nothing .
and now you tell me .
i do n't want to . it 's different .
but you 're a doctor . you kill people every day .
i do n't thinki can .
i thought we all were .
who 's going to do it ?
is that all ?
unfeasible .
what ?
no , alex . it 's , it 's --
old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story . be rational , please , and failing that be quiet .
thats not a story , alex . it 's a corpse .
it 's not every day i find a story in my own flat .
no.the guy 's dead.what more do you need ?
why not ? what 's wrong , juliet ? are n't you curious ? do n't you wonder what he died from ?
no .
do n't look ?
do n't .
i 'm just looking .
what are you doing ?
what ? what 's wrong ?
alex .
i wonder how he killed himself . i presume that that 's what happened . what do you think ?
did what ?
i wonder how he did it ?
all right . no problem .
yes .
now ?
yes .
you want me to kick it open ?
open it .
so ?
alex , the key is in the keyhole on the other side .
hugo . hugo . sorry about this , but can you open the door ? it 's us , hugo , your flatmates and companions . your new-found friends . he 's not in . he 's left and we 'll probably never see him again .
a blue one , ok. and it 's still there .
i will ask you once more , what sort of car --
alex , how shouldi know ? i 'm just a girl .
what sort of car ?
so what 's wrong with that ?
he 's got a car ?
his car 's still there .
hugo .
david ?
maybe he did n't like us .
so i gathered .
david has n't seen him either .
no . any idea which channel he 's on ?
have you seen hugo ?
no , alex , we do n't really love you .
you see , they do n't really know me .
you 're right .
i think you 're lying .
yeah .
know and love ?
a miserable , burnt-out , empty shell of a -- alex pauses , looks at his drink , then at juliet .
the man we know and love .
-- which is a hack .
-- which is --
what i am .
-- instead of what he is --
it was you , juliet , it was you --
in a moment he 's going to tell he could have been someone --
not usually this drunk .
i 'm not usually drunk .
he even signs them , in his own name , can you believe it ? i 'd sign someone else 's name . i 'd sign his name . if i wrote them , that is . which i do n't .
alex .
aroused and inflamed .
what ? oh , yeah , sure , if you want . i tell you , every letter this guy writes to you is the same : they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography . i dream of your thighs , the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire , while i , aroused and inflamed -- '
so we 'll meet him , then ?
i do n't know . he sounded swedish . do you know any swedish men ? maybe it was just the emotion .
who was it ?
he seemed like a nice guy , alex .
has he tried down the back of the fridge ? i mean , that 's where i normally find things .
-- i 'd be the first topoint that out . in all kindness i would . but , like they say , you know , she 's got to want to change , has n't she ?
-- more than anyone she has ever met . in her whole life .
well , she had problems --
she hated you --
no . be someone else like him . one is enough . and what happened to that girl , that friend of yours , the one that came round . i liked her . i really felt we had something . she could have moved in . we had chemistry .
for the flat .
for my life ? at a discussion group ? i think not .
maybe you should go , alex.you 'll meet someone wonderful .
god , you two are sensitive . all i 'm doing is implying some sort of sordid , ugly , sexual liason . why , i 'd be proud of that sort of thing .
yeah , he had one too many of thise urges . you of all people should know that .
i thought you stopped going .
just serve .
did you know --
ok , so a has left you , b is ambivalent , you 're still seeing c but d is the one you yearn for . what are we to make of this ? if i were you , i 'd ditch the lot . there 's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love .
and when did anyone last say to you these exact words : you are the sunshine of my life ' ?
now , let me get this straight . this affair that you 're not having , is it not with a man or not with a woman ?
when you get up in the morning , how do you decide what shade of black to wear ?
i mean , what are you actually doing here ? what is the hidden agenda ?
when you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands , do you then summon hellfire ?
really ?
yes .
cameron ?
cameron .
yeah .
can you afford this place ?
well , that 's what i said , is n't it ?
you mean i can have the room ?
it 's ok. there 's no problem .
what was i trying to say ? oh , yes , i think , we think , or at least i suppose we think -- am i right ?
you were going to say something .
what ?
what ?
so , uh ...
yeah , well , that 's what she said . interesting . that 's why you 're here , you see .
i see .
interesting .
that was n't a question .
yes .
you 're sure of that .
no , i 've never seen them .
yeah , that 's right , that 's it .
is this where no one stays ?
someone lost the key .
loks like you had a break-in up here as well .
i do n't know . maybe i 'm a light sleeper .
yes . why do you think you woke and they did n't ?
no , they were asleep . they did n't even wake up .
i doubt it . and these two other people , did they hear anything ?
i see .
take a note of that , mitchell . only three , rather than four . write it down . you can use numbers or words , i have no preference . which are you using ?
yes , absolutely .
how strange . and how unsatisfactory to have misleading information . only three people here . you 're sure ?
no , three . who said there were four ?
we understood there were four people living here . not always , of course , but now , four .
who said there were four ?
two ?
there are only two other people in the flat .
and the other three people on the flat , did they hear anything ?
of course .
well , if you do , you 'll let us know ?
no , nothing , sorry .
have you seen anything or anyone suspicious around here in the last few days ?
no , not that i recall , i was asleep .
did you hear anything before he cries ?
so i just heard her cries for help and all that , and when i went downstairs there were already those other people there , so i just stood around really , waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived i came back upstairs . and that 's about all , i think . i did n't actually see anything useful , i do n't think .
can we come in ?
of course .
downstairs .
burglary ?
it 's about the burglary .
what about ?
good evening . i 'm detective inspector mccall and this is dc mitchell . i wonder if we could ask you some questions .
do n't lie to me . do n't treat me like that .
it was n't like that .
but i bet you did n't say you were going to split on him .
that 's right . you 're going to rio . rio de janeiro . on your own . come on , you should know . you bought the fucking ticket .
what ?
oh , do n't be so coy , dear . you 're going to rio .
eh , i do n't know .
and you need your sleep .
yes .
you and me ?
so let 's go .
it was on the television .
we already know . all about it .
i should hope so .
i 'm sorry .
with a face like this ?
i thought you 'd gone to work .
if i think you 're lying --
no one .
who have you talked to ?
no one . i promise .
visitors ? some friends maybe ? someone you talked to ?
no .
were you expecting anyone ? tonight ?
what ?
expecting anyone ?
no , no , no . that 's what you paid for it . two hundred pounds is what you paid for it . we do n't know what it cost us yet , for you two to have a good time , we do n't know the cost of that yet .
that 's what it cost , david .
you paid two hundred pounds for this ?
two hundred pounds .
two hundred pounds ?
two hundred .
that was stressful . i found that stressful .
it 's alright . i think he got the message anyway .
i 'm sorry .
do you think you could be a little more forceful next time ?
yes . they 're my friends .
do you know many of these people ?
no .
would you like to talk about it ?
oh , yes , i 'm fine , thanks , just fine .
are you all right ?
alex , i think it 's time for you to stop .
i 've never seen a dead body before .
yes .
is this what they always look like ?
keep it going , alex . you 're unstoppable now .
just get on with it , alex .
did you ever kill a man ?
it 's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction , afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is , quite simply , just that .
ok , i 'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- i 'd like you to name the song , the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band .
look , it 's a fairly straightforward question . you 're either divorced or you 're not .
do you smoke ?
why do you want a room here ?
which is why i 'm trusting you with this account .
oh , i see , i thought you meant --
you get the job done .
i 'm boring ?
and that 's why i think you fit in here .
yes , sir .
oh , it 's unfashionable , i know , but , yes , we 're methodical , yes , we 're dilligent , yes , we 're serious , and where 's the crime in that , and why not shout it from the rooftops , yes , maybe sometimes we are a little bit boring , but by god , we get the job done .
i 'm not sure --
but they sneer , do n't they ?
eh --
there 's a whole wide world out there , and it all needs to be accounted for , does n't it ?
not any real sneering as such , no .
-- is often sneered at . are you aware of that ?
exactly what i was --
accounting , david , chartered accounting --
well , it 's a wide range of , eh --
in this firm .
right here ?
here .
sorry ?
what do we do here , david ?
that 's what i thought .
oh , him . well , he died .
yeah , here , i mean , where else ?
here ? .
that one , last week .
what guy that died ?
that guy , the one that died .
what guy ?
what happened to that guy ?
hello .
no , but like all novelists , i 'm in search of the self .
and that 's not the same thing ?
i write about it ?
you know about it ?
the human condition .
a certain weakness .
for what ?
no . but he needs treatment .
and he 's a patient of yours ?
i 'm a doctor .
working nights ?
no , just leave it . he knows i must be at home . i 'm working nights this week .
shall i answer it ?
it 's an improvement .
a little bit . is that good or bad ?
did he sound upset ?
it was some guy called brian .
all right .
no .
yes , the telephone , but if it 's for me , i 'm not in . hugo you 're not in .
the telephone ? it continues to ring .
do you think you could answer that ?
it 's a breeze .
writing seems easy .
yes , i mean , who wants to read about another dead priest ? it 's about some other guy , some guy who 's not a priest , who does n't die . you see , it 's better already .
no .
yeah . well , maybe i 'll change it .
i see .
a priest who dies .
what 's it about ?
well , i 've been away for a bit , travelling , that sort of thing , and now i 'm trying to write a novel .
what do you do ?
would you like to see the rest ?
it 's nice .
i 'd be delighted .
would you like to come in ?
you must be juliet .
you must be hugo .
well , it 's up to you . seven six five . how will you be paying ?
the first one was fine .
it 's up to you . air patagonia . new outfit : via caracas and bogot . no catering . four hundred and eleven pounds . four one one . good value , but refueling at bogot is variable .
yes , the first one 's fine . heathrow direct .
air france . glasgow . direct , but then you 're looking at the wrong end of nine hundred and twelve pounds . that 's nine one two . it 's up to you .
what ?
air portugal , on the other hand , via lisbon , same day , five hundred and sixty-five . five six five . it 's up to you . catering important ?
that sounds fine .
october 15th , direct flight , london heathrow to rio de janeiro , british airways , you are looking at seven hundred and sixty-five pounds . seven six five .
and you said you supposed so , but i was n't offering it for debate .
sorry ?
i mean , that 's what it 's like .
i suppose so .
like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
diseases .
and what do you recognize , names or faces ?
yes .
but in your work you must meet lots of different people , every day -- new people , new faces . no ?
same as everyone else .
do you think you have a good memory for faces ?
no . i have n't seen them .
look again if you like .
i 'm sorry , i 've never seen any of them .
take all the time you like , doctor .
or a fake ?
is it real ?
your watch .
one other thing . do you have any tattoos ?
you can tell by the intonation .
it 's like recognizing criminals by their crimes .
offering it for debate .
excellent . dc mitchell is a rising star , mr. stevens . under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade .
both , sir .
well , it 's a small town . sooner or later things catch up with you ... do n't they ?
what 're you talking about , george ?
she 's a very groovy girl . that 's the problem .
then what 's the problem ?
no , it 's a very groovy girl .
do n't you like her ?
i am ... except i 've got ta do somebody at their house .
i thought you were in a good mood .
no .
look , would you argue with your doctor ?
i do n't know , i think ...
it 's great . you wan na speak to mary ? hold on ...
do n't you think there 's too much gold ?
yeah , baby , how 's it going ?
anyway , you remember harold ?
chicken salad , devra !
chicken salad .
yeah , baby . things are great . listen , there 's devra , whatta you want ?
you 're in a good mood today , george .
-- think what you have time to think , lester .
what are you talking about ?
lester , you 're a miserable man . you 're not helping anybody . you 're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business , do n't kid yourself . and you know the worst thing about it , even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i ca n't possibly imagine , you 'll never know the difference . you 're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you 're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she 'll keep her hands off him .
yes and you do n't have to be sarcastic about it , that 's a beautiful thing he 's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks --
-- is that what this is all about ?
-- yes , we 're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in , believe it or not .
-- is that right ?
you make me sick . just be straight for once in your life .
that 's okay too .
we can not go into this later .
ca n't we go into this later , sweetheart ?
-- cause she 's going to be very , very expensive .
-- what , who ? oh she 's very nice , yes -- i mean normally -- -
-- i hope you like miss shawn --
yes , sweetheart , shh .
lester .
why would i like to know if there 's nothing i can do about it , goddammit --
i just thought you 'd like to know --
what do you expect me to do about it ?
that girl 's making an awful spectacle of herself .
lester , do n't you think that uhh --
-- yes , senator -- just a minute , dear --
it 's just -- fabulous . think you could do anything for me ?
that 's george .
no , doll , i listen to you . and if a deal loses money that 's not so bad either if it 's handled right .
that you were just indulging me .
what ?
yes , but ... i thought ...
you suggested it , do n't you think it 's a good idea ?
i do n't know . he 's a hairdresser .
maybe he 's too flighty and irresponsible . that 's why i asked if he was a fairy .
why ?
i 'm thinking of investing with him . he worries me .
maybe ... why do you ask ?
maybe he 's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that .
well , i do n't know for sure ... he 's a hairdresser .
that kid ... the hairdresser .
who ?
do you think george is a fairy ?
do n't be silly . i 'll just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints . see ?
holy christ . you want to get us killed ?
sweetheart , it 's a bore out there ... let 's lock the door .
and who 's jill ?
she 's a friend of jill 's .
she what ?
well she ...
why did n't you come alone ? lester invited you . did you have to bring her ?
right now , i just do n't care .
but are n't you ...
no , baby ... i 'm glad you 're coming tonight .
no , that 's okay , i 'll do it now .
comb my hair out later , honey .
hello , george .
hi .
that 's great . you look great , baby , great . dennis , look at felicia 's hair .
i mean it or i would n't say it .
i know .
and i certainly would n't tell lester .
no , i know .
i would n't say so if i did n't .
she 's fine . you really think i 'd be a good investment ?
i hope she 's all right .
-- anyway .
i do n't know . just a minute ...
is she all right ?
hey , listen , baby , i 'm a star .
the shop . i think you 're a good investment , and i do n't mind telling him .
what about ?
yes .
your husband ?
why do n't you see lester ?
all i ever do is play . i should be doing something to get my own shop open .
what about ?
i do n't know . i 'm beginning to feel guilty .
we have this political thing tonight . could you comb me out at the house ?
whatever you say .
what 're you doing later ?
you 're looking great , baby .
i can see that .
jesus , i do n't know , baby , i been cutting too much hair lately . i 'm losing all my concepts ...
i 've never been treated that way , and i 'm not going to start now .
what kind of treatment ?
i 'm not used to that kind of treatment .
i 'm coming , baby -- how 's otis doing , anyway ?
george --
i 'll have mary wash you . mary !
-- to be put in that kind of position ...
i do n't want to place you in any position --
-- i like myself far too much , far too much .
-- numbers , and i do n't need to place myself in that kind of position .
what ?
nummers .
-- what ?
i 'm perfectly calm , george , i 'm simply saying you have no respect for me , that you 're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood ... mummers ...
calm down , baby .
i do n't care about that girl , i do n't care if she 's dead .
i do n't care .
but you do n't know what happened .
i do n't want to talk about it ...
i got ta talk to you .
you 're late , george .
i 'll be right back , baby , really .
i do n't want to see you anymore .
i 'll be back in a while .
you 're very rude ... if you do n't come back --
and listen , i 'll be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back .
i 've got ta give her some pills . percodan , she ran out .
so what are you doing going over there ? you 're not her doctor .
wow .
it turned out to be cancer .
she did ?
ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer .
i know .
gee , that 's very serious ...
i do n't know .
that 's very serious . who 's her doctor ?
yeah , i think so .
does she have a pancreatic ulcer ?
she 's got a ...
these attacks ... it 's got something to do with her ... uh ... pancreas .
what ?
i 'll be right back , it 's just that this girl is a different girl ... she has attacks .
why not ?
listen , baby , do n't leave , really .
thanks a lot .
you mean that girl , do n't you ?
i 'm not . i mean i 've got ta see this friend of mine for a few minutes .
i thought you said you were n't going anywhere .
my keys .
what 're you looking for ?
no .
whoever she is , she does n't give up , does she ?
hello .
shit .
god , i adore you .
okay .
do n't worry , honey , i 'll protect you .
i guess so .
how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked ? particularly in your business ... you deal with women every day ...
i guess so .
no . you know too many sick ladies .
it is n't ?
then it 's not your problem .
no .
are you ?
her ?
are you in love with her ?
no .
well , is she your girlfriend ?
i do n't know , kill herself . she 's o.d . 'd four times .
like what ?
no , baby . now look , that girl that called -- i have to talk to her , she 'll do something .

i am not !
you are .
i am not like my mother !
that you 're just like your mother .
then what do you think ?
no .
beverly hills hairdresser ... what kind of a thing is that to do ... you might as well be a faggot ... think that 's funny too ?
yeah ...
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence .
yeah .
you think that 's funny , do n't you ?
no shit .
in fact , i do n't think i 've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life .
no kidding .
i never get my hair done .
yeah , it is .
you do n't have to make conversation with me , i 'm not my mother ... do you have a thing about older women ... that 's sort of faggoty is n't it ?
what ?
do n't make conversation with me .
... just , you could look very heavy ...
why ?
i 'd like to do your hair sometime .
making it with my mother ?
am i what ?
well , are you ?
yeah ... i 've made it with a girl ...
i asked you first .
have you ever made it with a girl ?
nothing , i guess ... have you ever made it with a guy ?
what would my being a faggot have to do with that ?
see if you 've been making it with my mother .
why do you wan na know so bad ?
c'mon , tell me . do n't be afraid .
gee , this is great .
c'mon , are you or are n't you ?
... yeah .
well , are you ? are you queer ?
yeah .
did you hear me ?
no thanks .
are you gay ? ... baked apple ? ... they 're cold but they 're good .
no thanks .
chopped liver ?
i do her hair , yeah .
you 're my mother 's hairdresser ?
no thanks .
this is the one thing i like about this house ... want some lox ?
a little .
hungry ?
she 's out , but you 're supposed to wait .
yeah .
you here to see my mother ?
look , mr. roundy , why do n't you make out a financial statement ? it 'll save us both some time . miss michaels here can show you ... have it notarized and we 'll see where we go from there . miss michaels , would you get me a couple of forms ?
i 've got the customers ... that 's my point . i 'm the one they want . if i had my own shop , they 'd leave and come to me . i have a lot of customers .
i mean credit references , mr. roundy .
her hair , i do barbara rush .
pardon me ?
well , i do barbara rush .
what sort of references do you have ?
it 's got nothing to do with inflation . rates , for example , rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully . historically , that 's always been true , though most people do n't realize it .
i guess not ...
after all , mr. roundy , we 're paying six percent . six percent . fha 's at eight and a half -- no , we wo n't be going back to the old days .
they are ?
jesus , look at this . nine , nine and three quarters -- that 's our prime rate . and i 'll tell you something else : the big boys are going for it .
well , yeah ... you know .
you do know what money 's like these days .
right , that 's right .
and you need money ?
right .
so you want to go in business for yourself ?
great .
i went to school with her husband .
she is .
wonderful woman .
great .
how is she ?
right .

lester 's left felicia . he 's taking me to acapulco on the five o'clock flight . he 's asked me to marry him .
what 's too late about it ? look , we 're not dead , are we ? that 's the only thing that 's too late .
it 's too late ...

george ...
there was nothing to know . anyway ... if i ca n't have love i have to at least have money . i have to have some pride i can do something .
did lester know about him ?
anyway , he offered me a silver cloud . at least he should give me a ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something ...

i just ... who what ?
who ?
they 're dumb , somebody ... i do n't know ...
what ?
i 've had these dumb dreams lately .
i do n't know ... just ... somebody 's going to get me .
well , like what ?
i do n't know ... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful 's going to happen .
what 's gon na happen ?
let me come , too . please do n't leave me alone .
well , it 's a big canyon . honey , i 'm sorry but i 've got ta get back ... just for a minute .
here in the canyon .
where ?
gunshots , there were some gunshots .
what 're you talking about ?
there were some shots .
well , baby , i 'm george and it needs to be cut . but i do n't want to place you in that position either .
i just needed a wash and set , a wash and set , that 's all .
said what !
but mr. norman said --
you need a cut .
no ?
no .
-- a wash and set .
what 're you here for ?
yeah , the clap . that 's what she thinks . but who knows -- i do n't know .
what ?
oh , by the way , i think you oughta know -- lorna thinks she 's got the clap .
i 'm finished with her .
yes i do .
you really think so ?
no , man , no . you can say everybody 's a whore . she 's okay . i mean jackie 'll fuck around but not that much . somewhere she really likes you , lester , and it 's not just the bread . she 's okay .
just a whore , i go over there , have a few drinks and get my gun off . i 'm through with her , she 's nothing but a whore .
no --
she 's nothing but a whore .
lester , it just happened .
i mean , how did that happen ?
what about her ?
what about jackie ?
i do n't either , lester , i swear to you i do n't .
yeah , , it goes up a little and then it goes down , maybe nixon will do something . what 's the difference , they 're all a bunch of jerks . i would n't let 'em run my business , i can tell you that much . not if i had any choice in the matter . i do n't know what to do with you . i do n't know , i do n't know what 's right or wrong anymore .
oh yeah ...
... you can lose it all ; you can lose it all no matter who you are ... i do n't know , what 's the point of having it all . look at me . i do n't have a goddam thing ... the market 's terrible right now , went down ten points last week , goddam lyndon johnson !
i was gon na give you the money . probably i was . shit , i do n't know , i do n't know anything anymore .
hey , you were never going to give me the money .
me !
who ?
hell of a way to treat a business partner , that 's all i can say .
i 'll have to wash one out .
i know .
you do n't have a clean glass in the house .
okay , thanks .
have a drink .
no thanks .
want a drink ?
well , i do n't know .
oh , fuck , lester , how should i know ?
why , why do you think that is ?
oh , are you kidding , man ? she hates her .
do you think lorna hates her ? i do n't think she hates her . i mean she may resent her a little ...
we 're always trying to fuck them ... they know it and they like it and they do n't like it ... that 's just how it is ... look , it 's got nothing to do with you , man . it just happened . felicia 's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she 's getting older ... her daughter hates her , what 's she going to do , go to pta meetings ?
... yes , i follow your thinking on that .
... how am i gon na tell you what they have against you ? i mean jesus fucking christ , they 're women , are n't they ? have you ever listened to women talk , man ? have you ? well i do , i do 'til it 's fucking coming out of my ears . i 'm on my feet all day , every fucking day , listening to women talk and you know what they talk about , do n't you ? being fucked up by some guy . that 's all that 's on their minds . i 'm sure you 've done something they could get pissed off about , what 's that got to do with it ? all women are pissed off , man , all of 'em . they fucking hate us ! do n't you know that ?
i wan na hear it from you !
did n't they tell you ?
did they have something against me ?
what , do you think i planned it ?
was it me , did you have something against me ?
no , not yet , not yet . you worry about it for a while , i 've been worrying all night , now you can worry .
then do n't ... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you 're gon na do .
that 's got nothing to do with it ... you 're so beyond my comprehension i ca n't even discuss it with you .
i 'm not anti-establishment .
i wan na know your thinking , i wan na know how someone like you thinks . did you think you could get away with it , did you think you could put something over on me ? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people 's backs and taking advantage of them ? maybe that 's your idea of being anti establishment !
what can i say !
i wan na hear about it .
hey , have 'em put me away , or whatever you 're gon na do , okay ? ... i 'm too tired to lie , i 'm too tired to tell the truth ... i 'm too tired for anything .
i wan na hear about it , george .
oh jesus christ .
i wan na hear about it .
i said sit down !
but ...
sit down .
now wait a minute ...
godammit , george ...
well , what ?
yeah , i 'm unhappy with you about something .
look , lester ... are you unhappy with me about something ?
what do they look like ? ...
well ... who are those guys ?

you live like a pig .
well yeah , otherwise it just sort , you know , lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
layered ?
this really ought to be layered ...
no it keeps the skin peeling . you 've got to keep the follicles open . you lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that 's how you lose it .
is n't that bad for it ?
well -- i could try . do you wash your hair every day ?
your hair looks -- well fabulous .
well anyway ...
see she does n't drink too much .
-- yeah ?
-- do me a favor , kind of keep your eye on jackie , she 's a little high strung tonight --
son , we 'll do business , i can tell you that .
i do n't know what to ...
it 's a difficult situation , and i want you to know i appreciate it . tonight 's going to be real tough for me --
oh , hey ...
george , i know you have to deal with felicia and you 're caught in the middle , and if you can just bear with me tonight , well , i appreciate the way you 've handled the situation .
i know it , son . but tonight 's going to be even tougher .
... this doing hair it 's ...
i know it , i know it .
it 's nerve wracking sometimes ... women can get you very upset .
you look like you 've had quite a work-out .
that , and ... i 'll be done in a minute .
what about , tonight ?
... she 's very upset ...
that 's okay , that 's okay , just shut the door .
sorry , honey , i ...
i know what you mean .
-- anything , i do n't care what it is , just so it 's something .
oh yeah ?
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do .
okay .
-- maybe you could , on your way , you know , pick up jackie here .
yeah , little election party i 'm giving at the bistro . it 's a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it . we 'll have a little time to talk there .
tonight ?
when ?
when ?
so i 'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject .
oh yeah ? i mean i know .
well , george , you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me , but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people .
oh yeah .
felicia 's really interested in the shop , is n't she ?
sure .
george , could you -- excuse us for a minute ?
who needs that kind of aggravation ? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age ? when i finish work i want to ...
you 're right .
no , they 're a pain in the ass , there 's no way of keeping track of anything . it 's a cash business and you 've got to watch your operators or they 'll steal you blind , am i right or am i right ?
they 're not ?
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into .
thank you .
it 's good you want to do something , george .
after a while that hurts ... does n't it ?
well , george , i invest for a lot of people . i make a lot of money for them . more than they could do for themselves .
i 'm better than the guy i work for .
but what ?
in a way . but ...
but the important thing is you 're successful at it .
yes it is .
it 's an unusual trade .
i see .
oh , well , i went to beauty school ... you know you go to beauty school ... and you get your operator 's license ... and you graduate ... and you 're a hairdresser .
i did n't say it , she did . how 'd you happen to get in that line of work ?
thank you .
she says you 're a fabulous hairdresser .
well , yeah .
felicia says you 're a very good hairdresser .
okay , okay ...

i 'll call you back ...
come on by .
i 'll call you back .
awww --
no .

no .
all right , who 're you with ? jill ?
i ... uh ... i ... uh ... ca n't .

was n't sure it was you .
what took you so long ?
yeah , yeah -- 'bye .

okay .
i told you i get 'scared up here , so if you 're not coming right now ... i 'm not kidding .
what do you mean ?
no you wo n't .
i 'll call you back .
i 'm coming over .
yeah .
you 're home .
somebody 's mother .
what was it , somebody 's daughter ?
i was too old .
and ?
a daytime soap opera .
a soap ?
well , commercials . i read for a soap the other day .
-- well , more than anything else -- -- i 'd like to suck his cock .
yes .
you do ?
well , whatever i am , i think i can get you whatever you 'd like .
sid . you must be a very important executive .
sid .
that 's very sweet of you , mr. roth .
well maybe i can get you something .
oh , dear that 's too bad . -- get her out of here , get her out of here .
-- you phony asshole --
yes , jackie shawn , my wi -- felicia .
jackie shawn .
you know what 's wrong .
hi , doll , what 's wrong ?
c'mon , jackie , i 'm only trying -- george --
i do n't know . why do n't you ask him ?
who 's the guy , george 's boyfriend ?
jesus , she 's my best friend .
does she know about us ?
jill haynes , jill haynes , i 've told you about jill a hundred times , lester , you never remember anything i say .
who are they ?
glad to meet you , jill , mr. pope .
lester , this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope .
george , glad you could make it , son . hi , doll .
because i do n't want one .
why not ?
no .
are n't you going to have one ?
here .
they 're yorkies and they do n't shed .
they get hair all over the place .
you ought to get rid of those dogs .
just a second , i 've got ta clean this mess up or the dogs 'll have it all over the house .
i 'd like a drink .
oh , i 'm sorry .
shut the door , shut the door !
fine .
maybe he ought to go to beauty school . anyway , see you tonight , doll , okay ?
you 're still jealous .
what 's that ?
you 're lying about one thing , lester .
look ... you do well for people , they do n't ask you to stop . nobody wants you to stop making money , doll , not even uncle sam . they all want their share .
you and your touchy investors .
really ? how about starting with tonight ?
it 's very logical , it 's the most logical thing in the world . you would n't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner , and a little conversation and so forth ...
that 's not very logical , lester .
of course not .
so i ca n't talk to some broken down actor , what do you think , i 'm going to tell him i 'm screwing lester karpf !
now listen , jackie , i 'm not jealous of anybody , i just ca n't afford to get caught ... off base .
i 'm not jealous of the dogs .
i 'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody , i ca n't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you . you 're driving me up the wall , lester . you 're even jealous of the dogs . i mean i 've got ta have somebody i can talk to .
i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica , what was i supposed to do , hide in the ladies room ? yes , i was talking to him .
then you were talking to him .
steve slutes , and he 's not a boy . steve could n't get arrested as an actor . he could n't get arrested as a boy .
whatever his name is , that actor .
steve ?
my secretary saw you with that boy .
who do you think i was talking to ?
who were you talking to ?
i am ?
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy , you 're always on the phone .
no kidding ? your own shop ?
george is going to open a shop .
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood . the guy in the third chair 's dynamite ... nobody much .
is that right ?
well , yes , george is a wonderful hairdresser .
is that right ?
oh , hi , i mean hello , we 've met .
how did you lose that key ? oh , george , this is uh miss -- this is jackie .
the man from sloan 's is coming . i called you about it .
anyway , you 're crazy .
see you later .
fine .
i 'll call you .
that 's right .
oh yeah ?
poster-kleiser .
i have to meet a client ... who 're you dating ?
going for a pony ride at kiddielands , want to come along ?
jackie , what 're you doing ?
hi , leonard .
no , he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- god , it was hot . the wood on the sundeck , everything .
no , it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time ?
well ... i just kept wiping that dish . maybe it does n't sound very sexy but it was .
what did you do ?
-- he reached up and tore them .
did n't you have any panties on ?
-- he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just ... lifted up my skirt , and , you know , right there ...
... mmm-hmmm .
-- well it was very hot so i 'd left the door open and the water was running so i did n't hear him come down the stairs ...
-- uhh-huhh ...
-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show ...
-- yesss ?
well , there was this one time --
c'mon .
-- i guess i just blocked it out , that 's all .
-- well -- not going in and out , i do n't mean just that . why are you asking me ? you went with george longer than i have .
-- when you say forty-five minutes or an hour , do you mean continuous time ? just continually , without stopping ?
-- see , i just know that if i go to egypt , well , things happen , i just do n't know what 'll happen to us , he just never seems to think ahead , does he ?
i think you 're going to hit that car in front of us .
what ?
honey ?
i would say so , yes .
quite a while ... an hour , an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that 's quite a while , is n't it ?
it 's been so long i do n't how long ?
well yes -- you know that about george .
he does ?
well ... it 's not so much the number of times he does it , it 's ... he does it for a long time .
what ?
jackie --
how much ?
i 'm exaggerating .
after four years ? no i do n't ... and i do n't know too many girls who do .
well , you know what i mean .
really , jill , are n't you exaggerating just a little ? five times a day ?
-- i guess it 's all got to do with this shop .
five times a day ?
i do n't know . one minute he 's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything 's going to be great and he 's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he wo n't even talk to me . it 's driving me crazy .
-- yeah , honey ...
but you have problems ?
we do n't think marriage is important .
well they are . but we have problems . you say things are great with lester . is he going to marry you ?
i thought you said things were great with george .
well , it 's george .
it must be something .
nothing .
well , what is it , honey ?
-- no . no really .
you 're really a love -- you sure ?
do n't be silly .
jill , you 're a real sweetie pie . you really are . you 're sure you do n't mind ?
i guess not .
face it , you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you 've got to find somebody . face it , time is n't on your side .
george is great but i know what you mean .
i spent three years with him . i just could n't take it not knowing who was gon na pay the rent ... his unemployment or mine . george was adorable but it drove me crackers . now at least i 'm comfortable . lester does what he says he 'll do . maybe you 're happy living like a gypsy . are you ?
i know , i 'm sorry .
jill , i 'm just trying to be helpful .
so what 's your point ?
well , he is .
no , listen . he 's a very good hairdresser .
i 'm not . maybe i am .
oh , honey , do n't be totally naive .
i am ? i mean why ?
a real swinger . he 's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years .
who is that ?
i think you 're crazy . do n't look over , it 's lenny silverman .
i 'm telling you he wo n't know the difference .
-- still -- at least we should tell him we 're going . c'mon .
-- he 'll never know the difference .
we ca n't really leave that poor man here alone .
what 's wrong ?
-- just before i ask you out ? i ca n't do that . let 's get out of here before good old les catches up with us again .
johnny ! why did n't you tell me before ?
those arabs wo n't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes .
you 're kidding .
you 're going .
you 're going ?
two weeks from tomorrow .
now i did n't mean that , you rat .
you mean when are you going to egypt ?
-- so when are you going to egypt ?
of course not .
oh , johnny , mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we 'd take him . do you mind ?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in .
-- why ?
let 's do that .
well -- as i see it we 've got two choices . we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off , or we can go to my party .
-- oh i do n't know --
-- jackie really should n't drink --
george is a hairdresser , is n't he ?
that bastard .
well did he go in there with jackie ?
i do n't think so .
george ? was he alone ?
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room .
well ... sure ...
this other couple that we 're here with , do you know them very well ?
not with your hairdresser .
getting your hair done ... would you like to go to a party ?
-- oh , sure . a hairdresser . how ... how do you a ... meet a hairdresser ?
he 's a hairdresser .
good for you .
-- no .
what does he do ? is he an actor ?
-- never mind .
i 'm terribly sorry .
my god , did i say that ? i do n't believe it .
johnny !
i see . you mean he just sort of fucks you .
sort of .
-- sort of a boyfriend ?
of course not ... he 's sort of a boyfriend .
is he an enemy ?
well he 's not exactly a friend .
all right , forget this filth . continue about your friend .
... my friend does n't like it here either .
are you kidding ? his hair 's probably the most nutritious thing in here . see , you 've reduced me to eating weeds .
why do n't you ask for another one ?
sure .
oh . thank you .
now i 'm embarrassed to tell you .
go ahead , jill , you can say it .
well , that 's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad .
but why egypt ?
that 's right .
egypt ?
-- just wonderful .
thank you .
gee ... that 's wonderful , jill .
-- yes , jill .
jill .
jill .
what did you say your name was , sweetheart ?
that 's fine --
-- there 's not much room --
-- oh no , honey , i 'll do that ...
-- i 'll get in the back --
sure thing , mr. karpf . c'mon .
-- listen , i wonder if you kids could give me a ride ? i 'm kind of stranded here .
oh that 's no problem . -- take care of this boy 's problem , will you , gene ?
-- his car . they have it blocked .
-- what 's the problem , honey ?
thanks for coming by .
please do n't misunderstand ... i 'd really like to go .
we 'll let you know tomorrow .
john ...
no !
no .
do you have something against traveling ?
no .
are you married ?
no .
do you have children ?
no , it 's not that ...
look , is there somewhere else you 'd rather go ? maybe we can change our location .
three weeks .
no ... how long did you say ?
you seem disappointed .
well ... that 's wonderful -- i 'll stop by there for a drink .
well we 'd love to , but we 're going to another party .
oh , say , how would you kids like to stop off for a drink ?
where to , les ?
call me les .
terrific . now all i have to do is find my car keys .
everything okay , son ?
-- we 're going to be here all night .
no of course not .
everybody but us .
have they sat down ?
i think they 're waiting for somebody to start dinner .
good .
yes , dad .
i love you , danny . i love you more than anything else in the whole world , and i 'd never do anything to hurt you , never ... you know that , do n't you , huh ?
yes , dad .
are you sure ?
no , dad .
did your mother ever say that to you - that i would hurt you ?
what do you mean ?
you would n't ever hurt mummy and me , would you ?
what ?
dad ?
good . i want you to like it here . i wish we could stay here for ever , and ever ... ever .
i guess so .
yes i do . i love it . do n't you ?
do you like this hotel ?
yes ?
dad ?
i ca n't . i have too much to do .
then why do n't you go to sleep ?
no . i 'm just a little tired .
do you feel bad ?
yes .
i am , dad . dad ?
good . i want you to have a good time .
yes , dad .
are you having a good time ?
okay .
how 's it going , doc ?
come here for a minute , first .
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ?
they had to , in order to survive .
you mean they ate each other up ?
there were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times . they got snowbound one winter in the mountains . they had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive .
what was the donner party ?
i think that was farther west in the sierras .
well you should have eaten your breakfast .
i 'm hungry .
yes ?
dad ?
nothing . there ai n't nothing in room 237 , but you ai n't got no business going in there anyway , so stay out ! you understand , stay out !
mr. halloran , what is in room 237 ?
no i ai n't .
you 're scared of room 237 , ain'tcha ?
room 237 ?
what about room 237 ?
not things that anyone can notice , but things that people who shine can see . just like they can see things that have n't happened yet . well , sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago ... i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years , and not all of them was good .
well , maybe things that happened ... leave other kinds of traces behind .
well , you know doc , when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind ... say like is someone burns toast .
is there something bad here ?
no , i 'm scared of nothing here . it 's just that you know some places are like people , some shine and some do n't . i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it that 's like shining .
try to think what it was .
maybe he showed me something .
now think real hard , doc . think .
i do n't know .
do they know he tell you things ?
yes .
does your mum and dad know about tony ?
it 's like i go to sleep , and he shows me things but when i wake up , i ca n't remember everything .
how does he tell you things ?
yes .
is tony the one that tells you things ?
tony 's the little boy who lives in my mouth .
who 's tony ?
tony .
who says you ai n't supposed to ?
i 'm not supposed to .
why do n't you want to talk about it ?
chocolate it shall be . come on son .
chocolate .
yeah .
do you like ice cream , doc ?
french fries and ketchup .
you do n't ? well what 's your favorite food then ?
no .
now this is where we keep all of out meat . you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers . you got twelve- turkeys , two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb . do you like lamb , doc ?
oh !
mommy !
danny !
mommy ... mommy ... !
danny , come here !
mommy ...
red rum . red rum . red rum . red rum .
danny . danny , stop it . danny !
are you having a bad dream ?
red rum .
danny ... what 's the matter , hon ?
red rum .
red rum . red rum . red rum .
danny ?
red rum . red rum .
if jack wo n't come with us , we 'll just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves . that 's all there is to it .
okay , mom .
make sure you come right back , 'cause i 'm going to make lunch soon . okay ?
i wo n't , mom .
well all right . but really do n't make a sound .
i wo n't make a sound , i promise . i 'll tip-toe .
come on , doc . he only went to bed a few hours ago . ca n't you wait till later ?
i wo n't make any noise .
not right now , daddy 's asleep .
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine ?
yes ?
mom ?
no .
i did n't think it was going to be this big , did you ?
yeah .
it 's so pretty .
yeah .
oh what a maze . is n't it beautiful .
yeah .
give me your hand . oh , is n't it beautiful .
okay ... oh !
okay danny , you win . let 's take the rest of this walking , huh ?
and you 're gon na lose . and i 'm gon na get you - you betta run fast ! look out - i 'm coming in close . all right ?
all right .
the loser has to keep american clean , how 's that ?
okay . you behave yourself .
yeah .
danny , come on over here .
yeah .
do n't worry , mom . i know all about cannabilism , i saw it on t.v .
jack ...
hey , was n't it around here that the donner party got snowbound ?
okay , mom .
we 'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel , okay ?
okay .
we 're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then i 'll come back and check on you , okay ?
what about tony ? he 's looking forward to the hotel , i bet .
yeah , i guess so .
yeah , i know . it always takes a little time to make new friends .
yeah , i guess so . anyway , there 's hardly anybody to play with around here .
sure , danny , it will be lots of fun .
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter ?
yeah .
yes , i 'd like you to .
do i have to ?
now i 'm going to ask you to do me a favor , and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day . okay ?
does tony ever tell you to do things ?
to my stomach .
where does he go ?
because he hides .
why not ?
no .
if you were to open your mouth now , could i see tony ?
oh ,
no . it 's the little boy that lives in my mouth .
is tony one of your animals ?
talking to tony .
now danny , can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth ?
mommy saying , 'wake up , wake up , wake up danny , wake up . '
what 's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth ?
yes .
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth ?
no .
now danny , when you were brushing your teeth , do you remember if you smelled anything funny , or saw any bright flashing lights , or anything at all strange ?
well it 's just one of those things . you know ... purely an accident , um . my husband had oh ... been drinking , and he came home about three hours late , so he was n't exactly in the greatest mood that night . and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room ... and my husband grabbed his arm , you know , and pulled him away from them . it 's ... it 's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know , in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just ... used too much strength and he injured danny 's arm .
how did he manage to do that ?
ah he dislocated his shoulder .
what sort of injury did he have ?
no , um let 's see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school .
did tony 's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here ?
tony .
did the appearance of danny 's imaginary friend ... ?
only about three months . eh we 're from vermont . my husband was teaching school there .
have you been in boulder long , mrs. torrance ?
mrs. torrance , most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained . they are brought on by emotional factors , and they rarely occur again .
but eh what was the matter with him ?
oh , yeah . oh , yeah , he seems absolutely fine now , but you should have seen him .
mrs. torrance , i do n't think you have anything to worry about . i 'm quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny .
thank you .
please ...
yes .
shall we go into the living room ?
great . sit down . oh these marvellous doughnuts , help yourself . coffee will be ready in a few minutes .
sure .
well i 'm going to have some coffee . would you like some ?
it 's okay , really .
well how can i repay you ?
oh i would n't think of it .
you give your word on that do you , mr. torrance ?
there 's nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure , mr. grady .
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way , mr. torrance . i fear that is the only thing to do .
for the moment , mr. grady . only for the moment .
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined , mr. torrance . somewhat more resourceful , she seems to have got the better of you .
just give me one more chance to prove it , mr. grady . that 's all i ask .
will you indeed , mr. torrance .
no need to rub it in , mr. grady . i 'll deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here .
grady ... oh .
it 's grady , mr. torrance . delbert grady .
perhaps they need a good talking to , if you do n't mind my saying so . perhaps a bit more .
she eh ... interferes .
well , he is a very willful boy .
your son has a very great talent . i do n't think you are aware how great it is , but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will .
how ?
a nigger cook .
a nigger !
a nigger .
who ?
he is , mr. torrance .
no .
oh , they 're somewhere around . i 'm not quite sure at the moment , sir .
and , er ... where are they now ?
yes , sir . i have a wife and eh two daughters , sir .
why no , sir . i do n't believe so .
eh ... mr. grady ... were n't you once the caretaker here ?
ah ha , it 's coming off now , sir .
why no , sir . i do n't believe so .
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?
that 's right , sir .
delbert grady .
yes , sir .
grady ?
fine .
wo n't keep you a moment , sir .
awfully nice of you to say . of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree .
that does n't matter , sir . you 're the important one .
yes sir . look um ... i think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen 's room , sir , and eh ...
advocaat is it ?
i 'm afraid it 's advocaat sir . it tends to stain .
hallo , this is dick halloran again . i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel .
good evening . forest service .
all right , sir .
thank you very much . i 'll do that .
i 'd be glad to do that , sir . oh why do n't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes ?
sir , i 've been trying to make an urgent phone call up there ,
good evening , mr. halloran . what can i do for you ?
hallo . my name 's dick halloran . i 'm the head chef up at the overlook hotel .
good evening . forest service .
no problem , mr. ullman . i was just getting to the ice cream .
dick , can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes ? we 're on our way through to the basement - i promise we wo n't keep her very long .
it will be a pleasure . right this way mrs. torrance .
dick , if you 're ready to do it now , i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen , while i continue on with jack .
oh , that 's just great . how do you folks like our hotel so far ?
the torrances are going to take care of the overlook for us this winter .
this is dick halloran , our head chef .
sure .
oh dick , come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance .
sound good to you , danny ?
good .
no , we do n't mind .
well i guess i probably heard you call him that .
yeah . we call him doc sometimes , you know , like in the bugs bunny cartoons . but how did you know that ?
i did ?
doc . you called danny 'doc ' twice just now .
beg pardon ?
well one thing for sure , you do n't have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice .
i would n't know what to do with it if i did .
do n't let it get you down mrs. torrance - it 's big but it still ai n't nothing but a kitchen ... a lot of the stuff you 'll never have to touch .
yeah , this is it . how do you like it , danny ? is it big enough for you ?
god . this is the kitchen , huh ?
oh wendy . that 's nice . that 's the prettiest .
i 'm a wendy .
mrs. torrance , your husband introduced you as winifred . now are you a winnie or a freddie ?

have you ever had a single moment 's thought about my responsibilities ? have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers ?
oh jack , what are you talking about ?
have you ever thought about my responsibilities ?
of course you are .
of course i am .
jack ...
as soon as possible .
when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
yes ...
you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor ?
well i ... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor .
i do n't think that 's true . i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny ... and i 'd like to know what they are .
i do n't know .
you ca n't remember .
i ca n't really remember .
i ...
how do you like it ?
jack !
wendy , i have let you fuck up my life so far , but i 'm not going to let you fuck this up !
jack ...
shovellings out driveways , work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you ?
yes .
you mean just leave the hotel ?
yes .
get him out of here ?
i think he did it to himself .
somebody did that to him .
good .
he 's still asleep .
absolutely nothing . how is he ?
and you did n't see anything at all ?
yes , i did .
you went into the room danny said - to 237 ?
no , nothing at all .
did you find anything ?
which room was it ?
no . it 's the truth , really . i swear it . danny told me . he went up into one of the bedrooms , the door was open , and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub . she tried to strangle him .
i dreamed that i ... that i killed you and danny .
it 's okay . it 's okay , now . really .
i had ... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had . it 's the most horrible dream i ever had .
fine . why do n't you start right now and get the fuck out of here , hmm ?
yes .
or whether you do n't hear me typing , whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here , when i am in here that means that i am working - that means do n't come in . now do you think you can handle that ?
fine . now we 're going to make a new rule . whenever i am in here and you hear me typing ,
yes .
and it will then take me time to get back to where i was , understand ?
wendy , let me explain something to you . whenever you come in here and interrupt me , you 're breaking my concentration .
okay . i understand . i 'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and ... maybe you 'll let me read something then .
i 'm not being grouchy . i just want to finish my work .
ah , come on hon . do n't be so grouchy .
what do you want me to do about it ?
yeah . it 's amazing how fast you get used to such a big place . i tell you , when we first came up here , i thought it was kinda scarey .
i love it . i really do . i 've never been this happy , or comfortable anywhere .
it 's really nice up here , is n't it ?
yeah ... that 's all it is .
well , something 'll come . it 's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day .
lots of ideas . no good ones .
any ideas yet ?
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first .
it 's really pretty outside . how about taking me for a walk after you 've finished your breakfast ?
hmm , nice .
i made 'em just the way you like 'em , sunny side up .
i know it .
i guess we 've been staying up too late .
eleven thirty - jesus !
it 's about eleven thirty .
what time is it ?
good morning , hon . your breakfast is ready .
yeah .
perfect for a child .
god , i 've never seen anything like this before . are all of these indian designs authentic ?
sure is .
uh ... huh .
boy , we must be really high up . the air feels so different .
great . look , i 'm at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through . i do n't think i can get home before nine or ten .
hi , hon . how 's it going ?
hi , babe .
well , it 's very ... homely .
yes , very cosy for a family , and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in .
oh ...
i 'd better collect my family first .
oh fine . well in view of all the ground that we to cover today , i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away .
right there .
oh ... has your luggage been brought in ?
no , my son 's discovered the games room .
good . glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen . is your family having a look around ?
no problem . in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat .
good morning jack . i hope you have n't been waiting too long .
well , you can rest assured mr. ullman , that 's not going to happen with me , and eg as far as my wife is concerned , i am sure she 'll be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it . she 's a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict .
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened .
well , obviously some people can be
well , that is eh quite a story .
shut in together over long periods of time .
the police eh ... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever , a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
well , my predecessor in this job
i do n't believe they did .
i do n't suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970 ?
i 'm intrigued .
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job .
great ...
they 'll love it .
how about your wife and son ? how do you think they 'll take to it ?
not for me .
can of itself be a problem .
that 's very good jack , because eh ... for some people eh solitude and isolation ...
five months of peace is just what i want .
well , that just happens to be exactly what i 'm looking for . i 'm eh ... i 'm outlining a new writing project , and eh ...
physically , it 's not a very demanding job . the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh ... the tremendous sense of isolation .
well , that sounds fine to me .
... the winters can be fantastically cruel , and the basic idea is to ... to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur . and this consists mainly of running the boiler , heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis , repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs , so that the elements ca n't get a foothold .
well ...
only in a very general way .
oh , it sure would be
do you mind if i ask why you do that ? it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic .
let 's see , where were we ? yes . i was about to explain that eh ... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may .
susie .
well , if you are going to have some , i would n't mind . thanks .
jack , just make yourself at home . would you like some coffee ?
well , that 's very good time , very good . please sit down a minute .
oh , no problem at all . i made the trip in three and a half hours .
have any trouble finding us ?
nice to meet you , mr. ullman .
very nice to meet you .
oh , well - come on in jack .
i 'm jack torrance .
yes ?
mr. ullman ?
yes .
just like a ghost ship , huh ?
by five o'clock tonight , you 'll never know anybody was ever here .
yes , well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday , but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible .
it 's amazing how much activity is going on today .
how 're you getting on ?
hi .
hi .
thank you , susie .
thanks .
boy , i bet you we could really have a good party in this room , huh hon ?
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably .
oh , i 'll say .
oh ... well this is our gold ballroom .
oh well he sure did a beautiful job . pink and gold are my favorite colors .
as a matter of fact we eh ... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel .
oh !
this is the staff wing of the hotel . none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter .
all the best people .
royalty ?
even before anybody knew what a jet set was . we 've had four presidents who stayed here , lots of movie stars .
oh well they 're really gorgeous . as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel i 've ever seen .
yes , i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs .
oh , it 's beautiful . my god , this place is fantastic , is n't it hon ?
this is our colorado lounge .
fine .
bill , would you have the torrances ' things brought in their apartment .
well , that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first .
eight thirty .
what time does the plane leave ?
jack is a schoolteacher .
fine .
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter . i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through .
how do you do ?
bill , i 'd like you to meet jack torrance .
damn near . now i 'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised , but you two are going to bed . go on , now , scoot .
the moon 's not down yet ...
when me and sissy were kids , we were just like you two .
sure , uncle al .
can i tell you kids something ?
i do n't know . maybe he does n't know , either .
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with ?
jesus .
blue . this blue .
lowe 's car- ?
why has n't he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters ?
i do n't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is , jane . because i do n't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair .
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb , why has n't he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty 's sending poison-pen letters ?
uncle al-
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ !
you 're a real booger , you know it ?
all except my legs ... i do n't think i can walk .
are you all right , marty ?
jane-
do n't you touch me , snotbrains !
will you ?
please , uncle al .
will you marry me , jane ?
do n't tell me what i have to do and what i do n't , booger-brains .
jane ... you do n't have to do that .
jane , i have to talk to you .
went shopping . why ?
where 's mom ?
marty ? you okay ? you 've just been sitting here all morning .
let me help you up .
yes . go away .
stop it !
what do you expect , when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed ?
mom was really mad at him this time , was n't she ?
it was brady 's idea , jane . honest to god . please take the money . i want to make up .
i do n't want your money . you 're a booger .
a new pair of panty hose . is it enough ?
what 's the money for ?
if you do n't stop it i 'm going to vomit . i mean it .
did he really get his head cut off , dad ? that 's what brady said .
brady 's a booger and so are you !
come on , jane- it was brady 's idea . i could n't stop him .
you always take his side because he 's a cripple ! well , it 's not my fault that he 's a cripple !
okay . have you got enough gas to get home , marty ?
yeah ... but if you hear any more noises , tell your father . okay ?
well , it 's probably nothing . i 'm just spooked since ... you know .
and my dad says it 's kids . but it 's not rats and it 's not kids . it's-
rats ...
rattling . rustling .
what kind of noises ?
i 've been hearing noises in there .
what ?
there 's something else scary .
hey , take it easy . i know how you feel .
i used to see her every day , and she never knew what was going to happen to her , and neither did i ! i mean i know how stupid that sounds , but ...
well ... it is his third .
for getting a divorce ?
glasspack . he said he 'd come over sometime this summer and we 'd soup up the engine ... but now i dunno . he 's getting a divorce and he 's in the doghouse with my mother .
what 's that ?
not bad , huh ? my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb .
that 's what my sister says , too . pretty soon i 'm going to start checking the mirror to see if i 'm turning green .
you booger .
then i 'd have to kick your ass , dear boy . go on , now .
what if i say no ?
i know what i said , marty- but it 's ten past one . he 's not coming .
but uncle al ! you said-
i suppose so . you kids ought to go up to bed .
yeah . really . the bitch of it is , we still are . learn from your elders , dearies .
yeah ? really ?
will you do it ?
dear boy , you have gone right out of your mind .
i think he 's going to come for me . not just because i know who he is , but because i hurt him . only i do n't think he 'll try again as lowe .
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit . a french jesuit .
no one knows how cancer begins , either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it .
marty , the moon was n't even full !
i saw what i saw .
you 're not going to let it go , are you ?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet .
and what do you suggest i do about it , dear boy ?
mr. haller said he 'd check him out , and guess what ? no one sees him again !
no .
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down ? you do n't think that was a dream , do you ?
it could have been anything , marty .
there ! you see !
no ... but i found some blood , smeared on a tree trunk in that grove .
i told you !
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder , i did . he 's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all .
shut up , dear boy- no gloating allowed .
i told you !
well ... it 's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws . also , i checked on the otic solution . it was counter brand . no prescription needed .
when he was a werewolf . yes . right . jesus . jane , you do n't really believe this madness , do you ?
i did n't shoot him when he was a man . i shot him when he was-
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn ? he 'd either be in the hospital ... or dead .
marty , do you see your suspect ?
i 'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription . and i 'll bet you another quarter he has n't said anything to mr. haller .
watch it , dear boy . i think it was a hallucination . probably a broomstick , or something .
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face .
you want to know what i think ?
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed ? you know who used to have a baseball bat like that ? mr. knopfler ! he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade ! jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick !
i do n't know . but i know you did n't see any werewolf the other night , marty . you had a dream , that 's all . an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what 's been happening in this town .
well ... was it a prescription ?
marty , marty , you should hear yourself !
it wasn't- i 'll bet you it was n't . because to get a prescription he 'd have to see a doctor .
what the hell does that matter ?
was it a prescription ?
i called peltzer on my way over here , marty ! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution . that 's a fancy way of saying eyewash . he 's got a corneal inflammation .
it came for me ! i shot it in the eye ! now he 's wearing an eye-patch !
you 're welcome a million , marty . stick 'em in the bushes for now .
thanks a million , uncle al !
a tracer . you 'll like it .
what is it ?
save this one for last .
yeah ... sure .
one of the reasons i love you , marty , is that you 're almost as crazy as i am . please do n't set off anything that goes bang tonight , okay ? just bright colors . can you tell the difference ?
yeah , i know . it 's great !
stay near the house , for christ 's sake- someone 's killing people . i have to be out of my mind to be doing this , you know .
yeah ! what is it ?
now i said i had something for you , as i believe you will recall .
good .
sure .
i know you do n't . but i want this to be our secret . you get that , do n't you ?
i do n't get you .
it goes fast , all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast , marty , i will have a new job . singing soprano with the vienna boys ' choir .
it really goes fast . thanks , uncle al .
you gave me a heart attack , marty . i 'm dying . i hope you 're happy , because you are looking at a dying man .
we 're gon na find out . take it down the road a ways and back . be careful .
do i need one ?
you got a pilot 's license , marty ?
wait , dear boy . just wait . hand me those pliars .
what ?
yeah , winesburg , ohio , was never like that ... but i got something that just might cheer you up .
uh-huh . only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain . hand me that adjustable .
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue . jane 's walking around like she 's king shit of turd mountain . like always .
your mom 's not around , is she ?
but you are , you know- you are my dear boy .
do n't call me dear boy .
i 'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives , dear boy- they 'll be interested to hear that .
well ... i like it that you always know how to say things , uncle al .
it 's just an outward symbol of everything that 's inwardly wrong in this town . not bad , huh ? i read sherwood anderson in college . i can jive that shit all day .
yeah , okay , the fireworks . jane thinks that 's all i 'm mad about , but it 's not . them doing that is just a ... a ...
and the fireworks . hand me that box , marty .
it is n't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady . now he 's got them to cancel the fair .
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they 're clint eastwood ... marty , did n't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies ?
what 's going on at owen 's , uncle al ?
what if it 's some kind of monster ?
huh ?
uncle al , what if it 's not a guy ?
well , i 'm not sure that was . christ ! they better get the guy .
no .
there 's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick . you ever hear that one ?
yeah .
you all right , marty ?
let the boy finish the game , nan .
mom- !
piss on him . piss on all the red sox .
okay , okay . dwight evans .
ralph houk ! you ca n't bet a manager ! stone the crows !
i will- be good , kids .
if you keep doing that , you 're going to bump your head , sissy . give my love to mama- tell her i 'll see her thursday .
you kids go to bed on time ! you 've got school tomorrow !
we wo n't !
and do n't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come !
-and babcock , i remember . now go on !
remember , al ... we 'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night ! or at the funeral parlor . it 's stickney and-
see me around to my car , marty , and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long .
so have i , actually ... i wish it could always be like this .
yes ... you 've always been that to him . but if you ca n't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home , you better just stay away .
i come here because marty needs a friend .
really ?
i must tell the cardinal . i.11 send him a personal letter , describing your efforts , your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive .
perhaps .
i ca n't wait until next sunday , when the choir performs again . did you see the people walk right in from the street ? that music , that heavenly music -- it called to them .
well ... thank you .
i have n't enjoyed mass this much in years . what a marvelous program . innovative . inspiring . you are to be commended .
oh ?
reverend mother , i just wanted to congratulate you .
i said i was a nun , not an asshole .
what about crack ? you a user ?
okay , so maybe i 'm a nun -- so , you want to ask me something ? you want to listen , for once in your little lives ? you want to pay some attention ?
yeah , you learned a whole lot , i can tell .
yeah . we all got caught . shoplifting . cuttin ' school . cuttin ' up some bitch with a blade . so we got ta come here . so we 'll be good , in the future . so we 'll learn valuable lessons . and i learned mine . i will be incredibly good , i will never rip out nobody 's nose-ring by accident ever again . can i go now ?
well ... yes . yes it is .
yeah . sister mary pat was discussing it . you know she thinks it 's a sin .
really .
yes i 'll sing and know joy evermore

sing !
but i 'm fearful !
sing ! sing and your spirit will soar !

i think they hear you !
let thy spirit

let thy spirit
let thy soul be healed
you know , i just might !
let thy thoughts be guided
i think i hear it !
by a voice you hear from on high
but how ?
let thy soul be healed
what you say ?
let thy thoughts be guided
you know it .
hey , sisters . are you going in there ?
how are you doing .
just tell him , i do love you , but i ca n't -- i 'm a nun .
what you do ?
hey , i know , it 's hard . but do what i do .
no , but ... i do n't know ... sometimes .
and you listen to that ?
well , what about the sex stuff ? what if some dude is after you , and he 's always saying stuff , commin ' on sweet and mellow . like , oh , baby , you know you 'll love it . oh , baby , if you loved me , you 'd stay .
probation ?
'cause we love it so damn much . and cause we got ta come here . probation .
excuse me -- just what are you all doing here ? at sunday school ?
well ... because it 's in the bible . `` thou shalt not ... '' thou shalt not .
how come ? sister ?
we were talking about the wild thing . teen promiscuity .
so , hi there . i 'm ... sister mary clarence . and you 're ... young christians . i guess i should assign you this passage . what 's good ? what were you talking about ?

what do you want ? this is a private area ! get lost !
that used to be true , vince . i was with you . but something happened . and i 'm different now . real -- different . i 've had , well , you might call it -- a religious experience . and i 've got just two words for you . and those two words are ...
i was good to you ! you re nothing but no-talent garbage ! you 're a two-bit tramp !
joey -- do it .
right here . let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this .
i feel sorry for you , vincent . and i forgive you .
she 's afraid . come on , tell the boys you 're afraid .
i am sorry for all my sins . and yours .
what , vincent ? this is me , doll . i know you . what did you think you were doing ? running to the cops . hiding out . no , no . you 're sorry now , are n't you ?
good evening , vincent .
babe , what happened here ? look at you .
right . yeah . forgotten .
and to say you 're sorry . about this afternoon . and the things you said . forgotten . completely . do you understand ? forgotten .
sure .
is that why you came up here , christy ? to thank me ?
thanks . a lot .
yes ?
no ... it 's fine .
you lying sleazeball ! the best years of my life ! what am i , garbage ? am i lint ?
babe , it 's not me ! i love you ! it 's god !
you pig !
we can still see each other . just like always . it 's a different kind of sin . smaller .
you bastard !
you want me to go against a priest ? get excommunicated ? you think i 'm nuts ?
what ?
he said that if i got a divorce i 'd burn in hell . for all eternity .
you said that ? and what did he say ? did he say you could leave her ? did he say we 'd be happy ?
for the first time in i do n't know how long . i wanted everything done right . open and above board . i told father antonelli i was in love . i told him it was a special love , for all the ages .
you did what ?
i want us to be together . like people . honest , decent people . in the eyes of god . babe , today ... i went to confession .
today was the deadline , vince .
how did i get so lucky ? what is it now , five years we 've been together ? who do i thank ?
vince ...
you are so damn sexy .
who ? the other woman . your wife .
what did who say ?
come on -- stay . just a little . we can talk , i 'll get a pizza . pizza in bed , we 'll have fun . and you still have n't told me what happened . what did she say ?
wish he was mine . that handsome boy over there , the one with the wavy hair .
d00-lang , doo-lang , d00-lang .
he 's so fine .
yes , betty ?
he 's so dreamy . he 's like ... a greek god . he 's the cutest guy here . he 's boss . he 's fab . he 's ...
oh my !
look at that . get a gander .
what is it , betty ?
oh my !
oh-huh .
this prom is a real drag .
yes , betty ?
oh , girls .
were you wicked ?
sing and the devil will flee !
pay attention ...
but then came an angel who whispered these words
what a shame !
damnation was all i could see
it 's true -- i know her .
my soul was in danger i 'd fallen from grace
get moving . i 'm right behind you .
hurry , sister !
this is so exhilarating ! all week long , i ca n't wait till sunday , when we sing .
jackpot ! two buckets
that man -- who is he ?
what is it , mary ?
and we know that , even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite , the lowest slug of humanity ! we know that deep down inside , you 're probably even worse . and so you truly need our prayers .
we know you do n't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors . we 'll pray to find you some honest work .
because we 're
spring is here the sun will shine i 'll be his and he 'll be mine we 'll love until the end of time and we 'll never be lonely anymore
so use it . when we sing hymns , they 're usually about rejoicing , right ? celebration . most music is . so do n't hold back . let all that joy go right into your voice . make me happy . let me hear it . perk out . perk down .
all right , i am , i know it ! all my life , i 've just been ... upbeat . optimistic . perky . i ca n't help it . even when i was little , i remember my mother used to say , `` that child is pure sunshine . she 'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess . ''
am i ?
hold it . mary patrick , you 're a pretty cheerful person , are n't you ?
the dixie cups ? oh my . i was just a girl . of course . spring is here the sun will shine
mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups ?
it 's a rhythm section . the beat .
i know . it 's ancient .
that machine .
no way . we 're a choir , right ? headliners . the big room . two days a week wo n't cut it . every day .
two days . an hour or so .
the goods . the sound . the sale . let 's rearrange a few things . mary patrick , you re not a natural soprano , you 're an alto . get over here . mary robert -- with the sopranos .
chops ?
you see ? we 've got the voices . they 're just allover the place . i 've heard all of you , in the shower -- you 're decent . better than me . we just need charts -- harmony -- chops .
mary clarence , could you ? mary lazarus , you 're terrific , but ... could you help us ?
hold on .
sure is ! come on in , and sing a spell .
is this ... choir practice ?
i love my heddles . show me again .
shuttle , beat , shed . and watch your heddles .
you betcha .
just about . show me again .
is n't it lovely ? now i 'll demonstrate , and then you can hop right in . you just draw your beater in , keep it pressed against the pick , and open the shed . then pass your shuttle , beat , and open the next shed . shuttle . beat , beat , shuttle , beat , shed . keep tension on the warp . is that clear ?
oh , right . at my old place , we used to ... wash cars . groom dogs . so ... nice loom .
mary clarence . goose . we 're completely self-supporting . like all convents . like yours .
but do n't you get money ? from the vatican ?
to sell , of course . i hate to say it , but we 're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine 's . we need a new roof , the furnace is going , and there 's no money .
why ?
well , it all comes back , in just a jiffy . i 'm working on a wall-hanging , of the convent .
not in years .
the minute i saw you . i said to myself , she 's a weaver . have you ever used a loom ?
no . hey -- he knows that you been creating now you 're gon na get a beating
1961 ? '62 ? mary clarence , that 's when many of us took final vows . it 's the last secular music we recall .
i have n't heard that song in ages . the ronettes ?
where did that come from ?
right .
is n't it a glorious morning ? good morning , mary clarence . sleep well ?
sing !
just sing !
you re okay -- for a civilian .
hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one . why do i suddenly feel like snow white ?
you know ? about me ? about everything ?
van cartier .
that 's true , would n't that be great . of course , we never know when things are going to change . any one of us could be transferred to another convent , tomorrow .
we could cut a demo . look for a label .
well ... see , at my old convent , i was n't always ... real popular . i was sort of selfish and ... not real helpful . okay , i 'll say it -- i was n't much of a nun . but now , thanks to all of you ... maybe i 'm shaping up .
is there any syrup ?
what ?
she 's a pro .
again !
babies
amateurs 2
hopeless i
right , right , cross with the left , spin and turn !
do n't look at your feet , and i do n't want to see anybody counting . make it look easy . again !
tell me about it .
it 'll be hell .
a bunch of real mama 's girls .
wet behind the ears .
i do n't know . mary lazarus , what do you think ? they 're pretty raw .
i hear you . how many days a week do you rehearse ?
of course . i 'm a nun . four popes now . the lord hates a loafer .
mary lazarus , i get the feeling that you like discipline . hard work .
i knew that .
yeah , for one second . that was the blend -- you 've got to listen to each other . be a group .
mary robert .
very nice . sisters , have we learned our lesson ? i wo n't hold this little episode against anyone . i 'll try not to .
you 're a ringer . she brought you in to replace me . out with the old .
what ?
free-lance ? oh really ? you think i do n't see ? you think i took vows yesterday ? i know what you 're up to . you and reverend mother .
sure . kind of ... free-lance .
um , i do n't really know this one ...
mary clarence , are you with us ?
whatever .
soprano or alto ?
you know that song ?
shirelles .
i like my old convent , in vancouver . out in the woods . it was n't all modern , like here . no electricity . cold water . bare feet . those were nuns . it was hell on earth , but i loved it . this place is a hilton .
like this place ?
progressive convents . vanity . it sounds awful . it sounds just like this place .
what ?
enough jabber .
which convent ? it was , um , the little sisters ... of the moonlight . in vegas . everybody used to come to mass . frank . dean . sammy . right at ringside .
he said , sing the devil away !
what did he say ?
but the lord came to me
do n't you know it !
i was hell-bound , yes that 's what they say satan was waiting
it 's true !
i was downhearted
bless you .
mary clarence !
she 's got nothing to do with this . let her go .
but what do they want ? where are we going ?
again ?
run ! take off !
they 're from my old convent .
wait , this is n't the way . who are you ?
right to hell . just kidding . where is that bus ?
the council of cardinals ! i 'm so nervous ! what if i forget the words ?
oh no . we 'll always be together .
are you leaving us ?
a thank-you ? for what ? you 're the one we should be thanking .
it 's contraband . do n't ask . but i wanted to give you a treat . a sort of ... thank-you gift .
we 're nuns !
yes , prayer is the answer , and prayers free we 're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house .
honor thy mother and thy father too do n't kill , do n't steal , it 's bad for you
we 're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit , now do your part
give me a c. a c !
i do n't want to mess anyone up ...
mary robert , i 've watched you . you never really sing . you whisper . nothing comes out .
what ?
now stop that . you did n't shoot at me . you were only trying to help , to give me experience . i tried to explain that to reverend mother , but -- i do n't know if she understood .
mary robert , i am so sorry about last night ...
we could have been killed ! but you saved me ! thank you , mary clarence !
i do n't know , some people just do n't like nuns . i wish i had a ruler .
what was all that ? who was that man ? why would he shoot at us ?
experience !
oh my lord !
mary clarence !
goddamn it !
keep moving !
mary clarence !
well , you know , you do n't have to tell her everything . i mean , nothing really happened . we just ... took a walk .
i ca n't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences . i 've learned so much .
honey .
mary clarence ! you 're so ... different from the other sisters . sometimes , well ... sometimes you sound more like a layperson .
good point . especially that dude you were with . i 'd like to see him down front .
those people are wonderful ! why do n't we ever see them in church ?
you watch yourself !
i 'm getting experience .
this is your neighborhood . your turf . you should get to know 'em .
who are all these people ?
really ?
initiation . you understand . later on , we make her wear her underwear on her head .
i have to do this . so i can become a nun .
right .
experience ! right ?
bobs
it 's part of st. katherine 's new community outreach program . how old are you ? you should n't be smoking . have you ever seen a diseased lung ? hand 'em over .
we need experience .
now you .
mary clarence !
are you sure ?
we must ... get you some experience . we must ... leave this place .
of course ! we must do it ! it 's the will of god ! what is it ?
we must do this sacred thing , mary robert .
reverend mother says you need experience , right , in life . in order to make a responsible decision . this is going to be very painful for me . you know how much i love this little room . this whole convent . wait .
what ?
well , then there 's only one thing to do .
she said that ? reverend mother ?
she says i should wait . she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life . she says that i 'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet . in a mature manner .
she wo n't ? why not ?
oh . mary clarence , i 'm so unworthy . i want to take my final vows , i would do it tomorrow , but reverend mother wo n't let me !
excuse me ?
no , you do n't understand -- i do n't want to get out ! i want to get in ?
right , sure , but what 's the problem ? are they keeping you a prisoner here ? do they drug you ? did reverend mother like , kidnap your parents ? we can call the enquirer .
you have to help me
yeah , like a learner 's permit , right ? when do you hit the big time ? you know , when do you take the final vows ?
a novice .
three years . a rookie .
three years . sister .
so , bob , how long have you been in ? st. k 's ?
right . okay . bob . nice to know you .
mary robert . i 'm ... mary robert .
thanks . so which one are you ? sister bruce ? sister doug ?
an extra heel of bread . please take it , you need your strength . you 've been working so hard .
a cigarette ?
i ... i brought you something .
what ?
i ... i ...
what ? what does she want now ? i did the dishes . i oiled the pews . i dusted the hymnals . two hundred hymnals . why ca n't people share ?
five a.m. ?
it 's after five . we have to bathe .
what ? what time is it ?
come on , we 're late .
do n't push it .
really ? and maybe shorter habits , and women priests , and sleeping late ?
perhaps not . perhaps we can all use ... a little spandex .
what about me , reverend mother ? i think you were right . i 'm just a bad influence . sister show biz .
you have evidenced great maturity , mary robert . we shall have a serious discussion .
i do n't think so . what about skydiving ? a crank call to billy graham ?
very well . i hold you responsible for all of this , for introducing a lounge act into my convent . for utterly disrupting our way of life . and for placing all of us in mortal danger . thank-you .
then i guess you 're stuck . life sentence . no parole .
i 'm a christian .
you saved my life .
oh ?
reverend mother -- thank-you .
saving you . move !
what are you doing here ?
good day .
but ...
i am sorry , mary clarence . i seem to have misplaced my tambourine . good day , mary clarence .
okay , so i just got things started . but you could build on that . you could keep it going .
you and i know that life is not so simple . there will be disappointments . rude shocks . and you will have vanished . how ... fortunate .
a part of what ? mary clarence , it is one thing to rabble rouse , to sweep into town and declare a holiday . you have raised the sisters ' expectations , you have excited and confused them . they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party .
but everything that 's happening is good ! you can be a part of it !
indeed . after how long ? a few weeks ? i have been here thirty years . and yet , it would seem , i know nothing .
but -- there 's so much more to do right here . and look , if it 's about me , i mean , i 'm gone .
i must go where i can be of use .
but -- why ?
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara . privately . i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible .
what ?
really . well , that makes two of us .
hey -- your prayers have been answered . i 'm leaving . in just a couple of days .
you have a phone call .
you sent for me ?
the majority has spoken .
but ... wait a minute ...
of course . mary clarence , a convent is not a totalitarian state . most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole . a membership that , i am certain , will vote in a rational and pious manner . all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program ?
a vote ?
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote .
is n't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals ?
the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church . they command the utmost respect . your more ... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place .
what do you mean ?
and on such an occasion , i feel a completely traditional program will be best .
and i am refusing . as of tomorrow , mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir .
please let me try . i 'm begging you .
out of the question .
hold on . that 's not fair . i worked hard with them . they gave up their free time , and they loved it . those women are happy . and we can get even better . we can wake this place up .
through blasphemy ? you have corrupted the entire choir !
exactly . people like going to theaters and casinos . but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that . pack the joint .
and what next ? popcorn ? curtain calls ? this is not a theater . or a casino .
i was thinking las vegas . get some butts in those seats .
the choir , mary clarence . go for the gold .
not the choir , please , anything but that . the choir -- i mean , have you heard them ? i 'll do anything , scrub floors , toilets , you name it , but not that i
you 're my olympic event .
no . no .
you will sing , and you will sleep , ' that is your schedule until you depart . as almost no one attends mass , you will be unable to cause further damage .
you have , i believe , some minimal background in music . therefore , you are to join our choir .
what ?
you may stay . but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task .
i am ?
mary clarence , perhaps you are correct .
but you ca n't kick me out ! guys want to kill me ! you 're a nun ! a big nun ! are n't you supposed to have compassion ? for the wayward sheep ? i mean , i 'm a major sinner ! all-time great ! hall of fame ! are n't i , like , your dream come true ? your olympic event ?
clearly , you have learned nothing . and you present an ongoing threat , both to this convent and to yourself .
a decent life ? excuse me ? as what ? a janitor ?
mary clarence , i have given you every opportunity . to change . to make a decent life for yourself .
i know ! i 'm sorry i did n't mean for it to happen ! and i was the one they were shooting at !
mary robert 's life was in danger ! your behavior was inexcusable !
look ... i know i should n't have , i 'm incredibly sorry about mary robert , i was n't thinking , i did n't know that would happen !
i do n't believe we have anything to say to each other .
so ... hi there .
look , this is n't my kind of thing ! i was n't cut out to make little tapestries , or knit little sweaters ! i do n't do that ! i 'm a star !
months of work , and the loom , absolutely ruined !
i 'm sorry , i 'm not a weaver !
good . mary patrick , i need you in the office . mary clarence , carry on .
really catching on .
how to put it ... ah , of course , mary clarence . `` no pain , no gain . ''
in english ?
do your recall the words of saint peter , in ecciesiastes 1:27 ? he spoke unto a wastrel youth . he said , `` take up thy task , and know ye the path of contentment . ''
it never solves anything .
you are correct . sometimes prayer alone can not help a situation . such as your own , for example . how do you feel about physical labor ?
sometimes it 's not enough !
we are nuns . we seek solutions through prayer .
have you been out in those streets ? do you know what those kids are up against ? you should help them !
this is a convent , not a clinic . we offer moral guidance , not hardware .
those girls were asking questions . they 've got it rough . i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age . i wish somebody would talk to me about it now .
a balloon and a banana ! tell me , mary clarence , what were you thinking ?
mary clarence !
deal with it , sweet thing . it 's important , nowadays . you just practice at home , with a balloon and a banana .
come , sister .
i got it .
girls , this is sister mary clarence . she 'll be minding you until sister mary patrick 's return . mary clarence , please assign a biblical passage . do not attempt discussion . am i understood ?
yeah ?
from all i 've heard , just about everything . your singing career seems all but nonexistent , and your married lover wants you dead .
what 's wrong with my life ?
i 'm sure . if i were you , i would use this time , to think about my life . and its direction . or lack thereof .
wait . no . you 're kidding . lights out ? at nine ? my day 's just starting .
it is nine p.m. pleasant dreams .
right . so what do we do now ? ping- pong ? row over to the monastery ?
your cell is more than adequate .
oh , i do n't know ... satan ?
and whom would you call ?
it 's like the stone age . the room time forgot . what about a phone ?
useless distractions .
right , sure thing . but what about , like , appliances ? like a little color portable ? boom box ?
our lives are simple . we have little need for material possessions .
you were right the first time . is this like , solitary ? the cooler ? where 's the furniture ?
your cell . your room .
my what ?
this shall be your cell , mary clarence .
that 's tomorrow ! do n't you have any snacks ? machines ?
yes . until breakfast .
is this all the food i get ?
no food . not until sundown .
no food ?
a fast . to remind us of the poor , of those who must endure without enough to eat .
a what ?
as a new member of our order , i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast .
until sundown .
silence ? no talking ? all day ?
surely you are familiar with this practice , mary clarence . only when our lips are silent , can our prayers truly be heard .
a what ?
sisters , for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence .
i 'm outta here .
and the vow of chastity .
like to who ?
the vow of obedience .
no problem .
the mary is in deference to the holy mother , the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola . there are three vows that every nun must accept . the vow of poverty ...
mary clarence ? like a guy ? like a dumb guy ?
as of now , and until you leave , you are sister mary clarence .
but look at rites look at this ! i 'm a nun ! i 'm invisible ! i 'm a penguin !
normally dressed , you are a sore thumb , and you endanger us all . while you are here , you will conduct yourself as a nun . only i shall know who , and what , you truly are . you will not disrupt the convent . you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk . you will draw no attention to yourself in any way .
no ! no ! i ca n't do this !
can do .
excused . open the cabinet to your left . you will find appropriate attire .
would you like that ?
how about a robe ? one of those big terry cloth jobs , with like embroidery on the pocket . `` guest of st. katherine 's ''
deal .
before we do , you might like to freshen up . and you 'll certainly want to change
cool . is there a menu ? or buffet ?
of course . but it 's almost lunch .
fine . got it . look , the way i see it , i 'm stuck here , right ? i mean , i 'm here or i 'm target practice . so here 's the deal -- i do n't bug you , you do n't bug me . i 'll catch up on some sleep , watch some tube , lay back and lay low . so just get me a key and show me to my room , and do not disturb . capisce ?
check your driver 's license .
what 's a concubine ?
absolutely not . i mean the wicked . the heedless . and their las vegas concubines .
you mean black people ?
and all those like you .
are you talking about me ?
i joined this convent some thirty years ago . at that time , the world knew some measure of peace . and hope . our order was a beacon of hospitality , to families , to children , to a neighborhood filled with promise . and , as the years have passed , i have watched that promise destroyed . drugs . gangs . spandex . and . so i have made this convent an oasis , a retreat from horror . and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls .
what ?
it has come to pass .
your cigarette -- out .
what ?
miss van cartier .
what ?
sit down .
you see ? you see ? i have to get out of here i have to make a phone call . do n't you get it ? i 'm in a convent ! you 're a nun !
i see .
beats me ! what do you think ? smoking ! heavy petting , without a chaperone . heavy petting , with the chaperone . and wearing a black bra , under my uniform . the demon bra .
the reason ?
i was expelled ! when i was fifteen ?
you were unhappy ?
parochial school . akron . st. android 's .
st. anne 's ?
oh my god . this is n't happening , tell me this is n't happening . it 's a nightmare , i 'm back at st. anne 's !
very well .
that 's my real name ! currently i 'm a singer . sort of .
enough joking .
christy . christy van cartier .
your name ?
mother theresa . gandhi . do n't you understand ? this is all a mistake . i 'm the good guy . i 'm the witness . and i 'm being punished !
what is your full name ? your christian name ?
a convent ? they put me in a convent ? what 's the problem ? was n't there any more room in hell ?
yeah , like what ?
i do n't know . there 's only one way to be absolutely sure .
yeah , eddie , thanks a whole bunch . thanks for sticking me in a convent . so you think , after all this , maybe i really am a nun ?
that depends . sisters , you do n't know this , but reverend mother 's been making all sorts of noises about resigning . that 's bad news . i do n't know if we could sing , if we thought that was true .
do n't you have a concert to go to ?
even nuns have to pee .
what 're you doing ?
nuns ?
you do n't get it ! it 's a big thing for them , it 's like ... caesar 's palace . prime-time . they 're singing for the cardinals . it 's like ... `` star search . '' if first prize was a trip to the vatican . they 've worked really hard , they deserve this .
they need you ? a bunch of nuns ? for what ? moral guidance ? make-up tips ?
that 's not the point ! they need me !
i think they 'd understand .
eddie -- i 've got to go back . they wo n't sing without me . i 'm deserting them .
you 're gon na be singing for st. peter if you do n't get your ass out of here !
i 've got a show -- at st. matthew 's cathedral . we 're singing for the cardinals .
what ?
i ca n't go with you .
long story . his goons will be here any minute . we 've got to get you out of here '- now !
how ?
vince knows you 're here .
i know , i know . i 'll be careful . i 'll try .
just remember - you 're a target . do n't you think vince has a t.v . ?
i 've got to go .
you re sort of ... radiant . your eyes are shining . you 're rea1ly different ...
i have ?
no . most of the time i 'm thinking about you . and now ... you 've really changed .
you 're not ... seeing anybody ?
me too .
well.. thanks . i 've been thinking about you.. - sometimes . i mean , there are n't a lot of guys around here . i mean , sometimes i feel like ... a nun .
no -- worried about you . personally .
you mean -- worried about my testimony ?
i 've been worried about you .
really ? lieutenant ?
yeah . you look ... great . i mean it..
i am ?
jesus , look at you you 're glowing .
i know that . this is n't about me . it 's about the choir . you should hear them . they 're good . really good . and i taught them .
listen to yourself . this is n't a career opportunity .
i really ca n't talk about it now . the place is packed . sro . i 've got a show to do .
you 're supposed to be hiding out !
it was n't my fault ! they just showed up . it 's helping the convent .
what if i was vince ? you 'd be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
eddie ! you scared the hell out of me !
go in and talk to her . it ca n't hurt . go .
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime ?
she 's counting on it . she 's concerned for your safety , but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you . or a carnival .
does she know people are trying to kill me out there ?
you blew it -- big time . she does n't want you back .
what 'd she say ?
do n't call again . it 's not safe . i 'll be in touch .
do you hear that ? that choir ? eddie , in here , that 's what they call music !
but it 's a nightmare ! mother superior is out to get me ! she hates my guts ! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture !
i just need a few more weeks ,
you son-of-a-bitch !
keeping our witnesses alive . we hide them , but there 's a leak in the department , and they end up dead .
like what ?
calm down . look , i did n't want to tell you this , but we 've had some problems with our protection program lately .
but i 'm going insane ! all these people do is pray and work , work and pray ! i do n't get it -- when 's the weekend ? they have gruel , eddie , that 's what they call food ! gruel -- it 's like alpo for nuns ! i sleep in a cell , on a board , and i pray five times a days do you know what i pray for , eddie , do you have any idea ? check your crotch , eddie -- anything fall off yet ? get me outta her !
not again . you ca n't keep calling . somebody 's going to catch on to where you are .
eddie , you 've got to get me out of here .
pray .
i ca n't stay here ! i 'll crack up ! eddie , what am i gon na do ?
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent . nobody knows you 're here but me . we 're trying to get a quick court date . a month , maybe two , tops . i 'll spring you as soon as i can .
but vince has contacts all over the place ! this is san francisco ! they 'll be looking for me !
and one bullet . that 's all it 's gon na take .
with nuns ? with rulers ? no way . i 'm gon na go back , work things out with vince .
it 's a convent . all you have to do is shut up , behave yourself , and get along .
nuns , eddie . there are nuns here . everywhere . it 's crawling with 'em .
safest place in the world . you think vince would look for you here ?
i hate you . i totally hate you .
i 'm gon na put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you .
what 're you gon na do , put me in a bag and bury me ?
no nothing .
okay -- no limo .
jesus , what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune ? let me spell it out for you . you have to hide like you do n't even exist . you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight .
maybe hawaii .
okay , here 's what i want . i know about this stuff . a five-star hotel . with room service .
get a stenographer .
all right ! i get the picture ! i 'll do it ! i 'll testify !
you 'd lose . you 'd die . all over the sidewalk . and into the street .
ten flights ?
then-you run .
and if i do n't ?
screw you !
he did n't do you a favor .
i do n't know anything about bodies ! i mean , he did n't bring it home . he was good to me ... sometimes . he was sweet . he took care of me . who am i supposed to go out with ? he owns a casino . he let me sing .
i never said he was an altar boy , okay ? but he sent his goons after me ! they tried to kill me ! i 'm not kidding !
you could n't believe it ? vince the prince ?
right between the eyes ! down and out ! the guy was gone ! i ... i could n't believe it !
think again ! and get out of here .
information , baby . i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience .
when are you gon na get off my case ? have you got a search warrant ? what do you want -- cheap thrills ?
a what ? when are you qonna wake up ?
he 's a businessman .
oh , yeah ? well , how do you think i felt ? you were singing in bowling alleys back then . i told people you were a hooker !
'cause you 're always out , arresting people . making trouble . i do n't know why i went out with you in the first place , it was embarrassing ! i could n't hold my head up , i used to tell people you were a security guard !
so i do n't shop .
yeah , like what ? quilted coat hangers , that your mother picked out ? lottery tickets ? a travel iron ?
i used to buy.you , ..stuff . on your birthday . when we were seeing each other .
at least he 's not a cop . at least he can afford a decent gift .
from vince ? what a guy . doo-lang , doo- lang .
but -- wait .
really .
people throw stones . they call me names . i mean , really .
oh-huh .
jerusalem is a real drag . everybody hates me .
hail , mary .
hey , girls .
i would n't even tell the pope .
you wo n't even tell us ?
where 's who ?
vince is getting desperate . where is she , eddie ? where 'd you stash her ?
jesus . data-base hoods . it 's a wonderful world . beloved daughter missing . reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars . please find our adored angel , we miss her so . dead or alive .
they open a window .
then one day they find you .
a hiding place .
we could put you into our witness protection program .
i 'm telling you !
a nun ?
that she 's a nun ! that chick you 're looking for -- she 's a nun !
we did n't tell you what ?
but you did n't tell me !
we 're the guys from vegas . you had christy last night , but you let her get away . it 's upsetting .
who are you guys ?
i 'm sorry -- i do n't know what gets into him .
you found him -- but we 're not open yet .
we 're looking for mike .
she 's a broad ! got it ! just some broad !
but , boss -- she 's still , you know , a nun .
where is she ?
joey ?
willy -- hit the lights .
i ca n't see anything in here !
which one ?
there she is !
which one !
get her !
maybe pants .
i 'm telling you , she 's not a nun ! get her out of the nun outfit , and put her in some clothes .
so , take it off .
right .
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot .
it did n't work , vince .
well ?
yeah ...
i ca n't believe this . okay , i want both you guys to go back there , and both of you shoot her at the same time .
it did n't happen .
but , vince , how do you know she did n't like , join up and become a nun when she was in that convent ?
what 's the problem ?
not ... totally .
it 's done ?
you know so much . they 've got christy , and we 've got to find her . get her 8x10 , from in front of the lounge . fax it to every contact we got .
it 's a bluff , vince .
he 's so damn cocky . this is different .
take care of it .
and if she runs ?
maybe .
vince -- is she ... okay ?
she 's praying .
what 's she doing ?
and then we can ice her . no nun , no evil eye .
a sweater .
for like , twelve zillion eternities ?
strip down a nun ? you want us to fry ?
that 's what i figured , too .
i figured if you were gon na , then i would n't have to .
neither did you !
you did n't shoot !
no smart-ass remarks or nothing .
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car .
forget her ! we got the one we need ! step on it !
she 's gettin ' away !
yeah , right -- when i see it .
so that guy in the bar was right ? she 's like ... some kind of nun ?
we ca n't leave it up to the feds !
we 've got to save her !
that should have tipped us .
look what she did with the choir . she made us sing beautifully .
we 're losing it .
we sound terrible we need mary clarence .
dress rehearsal at four , performance at 8:30. sharp .
it should be here any minute .
is it worth it ? a lot of witnesses here .
are you going to shoot us all , tough guy ?
measles .
however , we can also pray for other things .
peace on earth .
all right . it 's a beginning . las vegas , nevada .
she told us about one . the little sisters of the moonlight . in las vegas .
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun ?
she should n't have come back . she knew she was in danger .
really ...
bless her ! there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve . that 's why many of us became nuns . it 's marvelous , reverend mother .
oh , she 's doing just fine , reverend mother -
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing ?
i need to see you , at once . girls , please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments . mary clarence ?
yes ?
sister mary patrick ?
reverend mother , on behalf of the sisters , i 'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine 's .
yes , mary patrick ?
impossible .
not a note .
christy .
mary clarence -- you 're alive !
a benedictine .
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun ?
but how do we get there ?
the little sisters of the moonlight !
and what a lovely name . las vegas ...
it 's so beautiful ...
she 's our inspiration !
well , i do n't care who she is . we ca n't sing without her !
she was n't a nun ?
an ... entertainer ?
yes -- two men -- and they had guns .
you mean -- they kidnapped her ?
we 'll pray -- and she 'll be there .
we ca n't sing without her ! what should we do ?
it 's no use . she just is n't here .
mary clarence ! sister !
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us .
mary clarence , do n't be silly . you 're an example to us all . you 've taught us so much . we 're singing for the cardinals , and then -- who knows ? maybe the choir can travel -- to schools , and nursing homes .
mary clarence -- you should n't have . where did you get this ?
ice cream !
it 's brought people back to the church .
but , reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style .
it 's better than springtime .
it 's better than ice cream .
i 'd rather sing than do anything !
he 's kind .
he 's decent .
he 's not like other guys .
that was exciting !
we did it ! we actually sang a chord !
really , mary clarence ? were you a choirmistress ?
mary clarence has a background in music . that 's what reverend mother said .
which convent was that , sister ?
is this like your old convent ?
since mary clarence came to st. katherine 's , i 've been shot at , kidnapped by mafia hit men , and i 've tasted beer . is that enough experience yet ? for final vows ?
yes ?
reverend mother ?
but where ?
las vegas -- she 's here somewhere .
but ... she was a showgirl . she did n't have an old convent .
she said they were from her old convent .
calm down . think clearly . mary robert , do you have any idea who those men were ?
her whereabouts are unknown , and we must proceed without her . pull yourselves together .
i do n't understand . where is she ?
and you 'll face that danger head-on . as if i could stop you . and you have my complete support in this matter . anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing .
but , bishop , surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood .
i know .
i lied .
st. katherine 's is a benedictine order . you have taken a vow of hospitality . to all in need .
but , bishop ...
your small convent is in danger of closing , reverend mother . the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation .
we 're a small convent , bishop . surely there are ... more appropriate shelters .
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation .
but she 's been exposed to the underside of life . she is the underside of life .
we can save this young woman 's life , and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture .
absolutely not . i am very sorry , but no .
find 'em !
where ?
okay , so the problem is still the nun outfit , right ?
we both missed .
are you nuts ? she 's not a nun . it 's christy . she 's a babe !
she 's ... she 's a nun .
she 's acting weird , vince . ever since we picked her up .
and who are you to talk ? you were nothing . you could n't even sing . i must have been out of my mind .
i love you , chris . i always will . i gave you so much . my time . my affection . a big-time career . and how do you repay me ? what 's the thanks i get ? where 's the loyalty , huh ? where 's the love ?
she 's a nun , vince .
can you hold ? can you try ?
it 's that call you were expecting , vince .
soon , you gorgeous thing ... tell me ... how lonely ?
she did . bring her back . now . for a talk .
i mean , wo n't she talk ? she seemed kind of upset .
he came to me . he promised great violence . said i should cast you out for my own protection . i must speak honestly . there is no reason to think he will not meet with success .
how did you hear this ?
clergyman steenwyck is calling a meeting . this time he is determined to have you forced out , or worse .
sarah has gone missing ... my servant girl . her things are gone . damn it . she has joined the migration out of town . what about breakfast , woman ? or , am i to starve to death ?
um ... i ... i did not ... no . why ?
well enough . your gathering does honor to the deceased .
hail , constable . how are you ?
these woods of yours sound a bit crowded , what with all the witches , ghouls and indians living there .
must have been the redman . a lenape indian lives in the western woods .
who took the meat ?
then , name one person who has seen him with their own eyes .
many have .
excuse me , gentlemen , but ... who has seen this horseman ?
this is not a time for frivolity , katrina , is it ? am i mistaken ?
if we could speak alone .
i say ... if the horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people , he 's solid enough to feel this ...
i hit him square .
you must have missed your mark .
i fired upon the horseman and the bullet did nothing .
constable crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side .
two days ... ? for murder ?
they spend two days in chains .
never . a shoe that size i would have remembered .
you are the blacksmith . ever shod a horse with a hoof this large ?
what the hell are you doing ?
well , unless your name is baltus , you should not worry over mine .
we have n't heard your name yet , friend .
excuse me , miss ... they have a laugh at your expense .
certainly not .
when this cut was made , this person was already dead . this is not lady van tassel .
what ?
no clotting or gathering of pus . no healing at all .
what of it ?
stains of blood .
would you stay , doctor ? i may need assistance .
... help yourself , you pompous ass . i will be in bed .
you will stay at her side ?
it has been a terrible jolt to her nerves .
you need rest .
bring him .
you need to sleep .
bring young masbath here .
he is dead . you would be also , if your wound had not somehow shut .
... brom bones ...
keep still , constable . you were half-drowned when they found you .
in time , doctor . soon as i finish .
i do not care . you are welcome to use my work area , but i beg you ... return her to her resting place .
the wounds are the same . cauterized . no chopping or half-measures either . one stroke took the head . have you seen , doctor ... ? even the spinal bone ... sliced as smooth as butter .
a diseased monster .
he is a behemoth .
the lenape . he comes to gawk at civilization from time to time .
what are you spying on ?
we must be a curious sight to him .
this should have bled by the pint . yet , no blistering or scorched flesh . how ... ? whatever weapon was used ... it cauterized somehow ... .
what is that ?
no bleeding .
to place it inside its coffin .
why did you move the body , doctor ?
i was afraid of this .
i say , is there any one person suspect in these acts ?
excuse me ?
an honor , gentlemen . in time i will need every detail of the three murderings you 've had , but , for now , i ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be ?
climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find , father . that is the closest you ever come to god .
you can not do this . i am a man of god !
you are so upset now ... and yet , you seemed in such good spirits last night .
he may . but , not soon enough for you , and not on your behalf .
damn you , sir ! god damn you to hell !
wallowing quite literally in blood .
they need guidance .
wallowing in sin and lust ...
i am the lord 's voice in this town .
it is only important what you are . an adulterer ...
are you a deist ? is that it ? a free thinker who does not believe in divinity .
oh ? far as i can tell , a rumor does not travel alone for long here .
no . you will not run me out . no one will believe a word of what you say .
only if i repeat them outside this room . and , i will if i must ... out there , for all to hear . or ... you may speak , as planned . but , you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures .
does that look like an animal hanging ?
for poaching . or , would you remake our laws now that magistrate philipse has given up the ghost ?
then , you should have left two days ago , because i have men willing to help me today .
your superiors are two days away !
protest to my superiors if you like .
i will not allow it . i will not !
i can not proceed without examining the previous victims .
it is sacrilege !
the heads were not found severed . the heads were not found at all .
all i know is three are slain , their heads found severed from their bodies ...
why not tell us what you have heard ? hmm ? how much have your superiors bothered to tell you ?
well ... that might be ... helpful .
perhaps , i could assist in finding them ?
master hardenbrook ...
damn ... damn ... damn ...
a fine idea .
maybe you should take this .
of course . you want them ... it shall not take long . wait here .
may we look at them now ?
hmm ? see them ?
may i see them , master hardenbrook ?
yes , sir ... but , do you have these ?
i have everything ... last testaments ... birth certificates , death certificates ... deeds .
do you have these persons ' wills ?
when a goblin leaps from the nether world , others follow . poltergeists of the air , water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations !
just a moment ... are you saying it is he ?
pardon me ?
taken . taken by the headless horseman . taken back to hell .
excellent . then , you are excused till morning .
i shall , gladly .
just so . granted . and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place . bring him here to face our good justice . will you do this for me ?
not for lack of trying .
these `` methods '' of yours ... there has been no practical application .
chosen me ?
there is a farming community upstate , constable ... ten days journey north in the hudson highlands . it is named sleepy hollow . within a fortnight , three persons have been murdered there . each with their head lopped cleanly off . the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me , requesting assistance , and now , just this very moment , i have chosen you .
not liberalism . equanimity .
for one who calls himself a federalist , your mouth reeks of republican liberalism .
even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused , often quite literally ?
very few , if any .
but , how many innocents rot here ? and , how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets ?
and , < u > with < /u > disrespect , constable , if jails and courts overflow , it is testimony to success , not failure .
without disrespect , look around you . we overflow . as do our courts .
have they nothing to fear presently ?
our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence , but if we were more often able to ensure justice , after the fact , then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement .
must we again hear these heretical rantings ?
i could determine if he were dead < u > before < /u > he went into the hudson .
he will be burned pursuant to statutes of health .
there are surgical ways of telling how he died ... by the water in his lungs ...
he drowned . anyone could see .
just a moment ... if i may . it is possible this man was murdered .
it 's not something people speak of openly . she did not remarry .
is that all you say ? look at her .
the widow windsor .
van ripper and his wife agreed to take him . they have children and a good home and good land .
tell me something . what becomes of young masbath ?
no , sir , no . if you ask me , i say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass .
more than enough , actually . i beg you , no more , please .
master crane , sir . i 'm glad we have time alone . you 've been told plenty about the horseman , i 'm certain .
at times i do .
no , you listen ! you may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards ...
listen to what you say ... .
i know it .
we are farmers here , not lawyers or bankers , or even constables . every penny we earn comes from what we send down the hudson .
are you saying i should be frightened ? is this a message passed on from clergyman steenwyck ?
not more than a year ago , a mob hung a man for stealing a horse . for stealing a horse ! and , you dig up our dead .
well ... so much for common sense .
my talisman . it will , protect against the horseman if i show a brave face . but , i can not run . if i run in fear , it is worthless .
what is that you wear ?
believe ?
... found the body this morning . you do believe now , do n't you ?
he would not have gone into the western woods . no sane man would .
why would he flee this direction , with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover ?
and now jonathan masbath .
the van garretts died first ; a man and his son , survived by a wife and two infants . and the widow windsor was next ...
the militia ?
well , constable ... are you aware ... to be honest , you are not what we expected . we sent for the militia .
tired .
how are you ?
i doubt that 's the end .
what now ?
take the reins .
what can we do ?
i know . hold on .
lady van tassel ...
climb up !
i can not . you should not worry . van ripper and his wife will look after you . they will . you will be well cared for .
take me with you . there 's nothing left for me here .
this is farewell .
you do not know all that has happened . you can not understand .
why ... why are you like this ?
nothing . to hell with this place and all the people here .
wo n't you change your mind , sir ? what can i say to convince you ?
i need time for thinking . without you hanging on my coattails for a change .
she 's the one who controlled the horseman , is n't she , sir ? sir ?
things have become complicated . katrina is at the mill . ride ahead , find her and bring her to meet me outside the church . find her at all costs . quickly .
what now ? where is she ?
but , sir ... what books ? where are they ?
fiction plays and novels . baltus does not approve . now , come . it may not be long before lady van tassel returns .
what books ?
it is nothing . she comes to read books , so her father will not find her . it is absolutely nothing .
there are no other doors . this is as far as she could have gone .
no . they are all missing .
something i really wish i had not seen . never mind it . did you find the victims ' loan agreements ?
what was she doing ?
lady van tassel .
i was getting worried . who was it ?
there are none for magistrate philipse either . `` paasch , james '' `` pieter , thomas '' `` pos , william . ''
there is no masbath here . my father 's loan papers are missing .
yes . i rode with him on payment days .
did your father take a loan ?
baltus van tassel .
often in such cases , property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to . and , who in this town is owed a great many debts ?
what does it mean ?
intestate . your farm ... all the farms ... they belong to no one .
in test ... what ?
no one yet , far as i can tell . it has gone intestate .
but , if the farm is not mine , who stole it away ?
only the heirs were killed . proof that the horseman slaughters by assignment .
yes .
and it now belongs to you , according to baltus . i heard him say it .
my father had farm land . it was the only thing we owned of any value .
to discover what might have been taken from those who died , it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place .
what good is this ?
because , i serve a fine purpose alive . it is perfection for our murderer if i return to new york city with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul . we must uncover the reason these victims were targeted . what was taken from them ... other than their lives ? who benefits by their deaths ?
if someone has the horseman 's skull ... if they control the horseman , then why have n't they sent him for your head yet ?
business , best hidden is hidden best at night .
all i saw was their lantern .
man or woman ?
someone left last night . looked like they headed to the square , but i lost them in the forest .
why this tree ?
we should go .
must be some sort of gateway . but , why this place ... ?
stay back .
what is it ?
good questions , deserving answers , of which we are in short supply .
then , who murdered the old crone ? and why ?
true enough .
well ... i 'm one of the few people who likes you .
you grow sharper by the minute , little man . it boggles my mind , but i begin to prefer your company over all others .
if the crone 's wound bled hard , that means she was not killed by the hessian . someone only tried to make it look that way .
`` let loose his silent shrieking . '' who knows , till we work at it ? i admit not being anxious to find out . `` he who holds the horseman 's desire will guide his reaping hand . '' whatever the horseman 's desire is , other than extinguishing lives .
what does it mean ... climb down to the horseman 's soulless place ?
we are far from the hollow . loath to say it ... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning .
should we go back ?
we should not go much further in this murk .
how could something named `` the tree of the dead '' fail to draw attention ?
follow the indian trail to where the sun dies . to the tree of the dead . maybe we passed it by .
what happened ?
we are leaving .
no crickets or cicadas calling . no bird songs .
i hear nothing .
listen .
what is it ?
witches do not exist . however ...
father said witches live there .
if the western woods are truly the devil 's glen , we will see for ourselves .
now , hold the bowl steady . back to business .
thank you .
i have others . all i need is this .
no , i could n't ...
yes ... i suppose it is . keep it .
it 's spectacular .
not for eating , i assure you . watch here .
what kind of nuts ?
are you familiar with magnets ?
look again .
the western woods .
out there . what do you see ?
it 's payment day . loan monies are given to baltus the last day each month . almost everyone borrows ... for tools or to hire workers .
what is it ?
up .
where are we going ?
his teeth . someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth . the lenape could not have done that for himself . someone out there cared for him .
how could he ?
the lenape indian had much to tell once i opened his mouth .
we must discover it . the reason the murderer chose these persons .
i 'm sure i do n't know .
what is the common thread between these victims ?
i did not ask you to , did i ?
young masbath , i am sorry for your loss . it is a great and sad tragedy . however ... i can not be the one to look after you now .
i deserve to help you . do n't you see how much this means ? my father ... he ... he was a good man ...
i manage fine alone .
whatever . you still need a second to tend to your things .
i am not here for revenge . i am here to bring justice .
we have no choice .
i ... i ca n't do this .
the blades will carry us to the ground . face front and wait for me .
no . get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump .
quickly , close it .
keep climbing . i will follow ...
ichabod ...
his horse .
what was that ?
he moves too fast .
the church .
i do not know . away .
where are we going ?
speak the words , constable . what is stopping you ? what has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality ?
katrina ...
call me a liar , then , and a murderess . say it , out and out .
the name van tassel is blackened . you share that name .
if you think i am behind this , say it .
what would you have me believe ?
yes , i have seen that , and i told you why i hid them .
the loans give the land to your father . it does not matter survivors are still on their farms . they could be thrown off ... tomorrow ... a year from now .
i have not been able to face him yet .
what did he say , katrina ?
he did not do these things . if you knew him , you would realize ...
and , what did he say ?
when ... when you spoke father 's name along with accusations , i could not believe it . i had to hide these ... at least till i could confront him myself .
it was you there ?
i have been reading your journal . i 'm sorry . i found it too fascinating to resist . i rode to catch up with you at the notary , out of curiosity . before i found you though , i overheard what you were said .
come with me .
what is so urgent ?
i 'm drawing bad blood from the wound .
what ... what are you doing ... ?
yes . i did notice that , thank you .
the skull is gone .
why is it every grave i open holds a new mystery inside ?
he ... he tries to take the heads ... they will not pass .
my god ... what has happened ?
just ... keep where you are .
what are you doing ?
what did you say ?
blood .
but , i am not alone , am i ? i only wished to see what you were up to , and ... to thank you .
a woman should not be out alone in these woods .
i apologize if i worried you .
katrina . why do you follow ?
it is only me .
i ... i do not know . i no longer know what i think or what i feel .
if you want me to go , i will . do you want me to leave ?
memories have come back . i had them forgotten , and wish i could forget them again ... but they are here now . lord , how i hate this place .
she died . her lungs were diseased ... two years ago . what is this about ?
what happened to your mother ? is she still alive ?
no , but ... why do you ask that ?
she is not your birth mother , is she ?
what ?
lady van tassel ... she is your stepmother , is n't she ? she bears so little resemblance .
what has happened ?
no , actually , you were not . every word you spoke had truth in it .
the things i said to you before ... i was wrong to say them .
what troubles you ?
allow me some time . i have spent every hour in the company of others . i need to be alone .
if it had been surgery on a living person , done to save that person 's life , you would not question it . not for a moment . so , let me be the first to tell you , dear girl ... on the other side of these sheltering mountains , a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours . and someday , no matter how much you fear it , that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber .
you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it . ca n't you see ? you 'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it .
but , why ? tell me why .
to avenge his father , and the others .
take a lesson from young masbath 's desires , ichabod crane . he follows with you to avenge his father 's death . that i understand . but , what do you want ?
i have no solution for its meaning yet , but i could not just ignore it .
what is it then ? scientific method ? how can any of this matter in the slightest ?
it was not butchery .
and this gives worth to butchery ?
there was no blind stabbing . this singular thrust found its target omnipotently , as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother .
must i hear this ?
the child she carried was eight months grown at least ... near to birthing . the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly .
what are you on about ?
you are not regarding it in full . the widow windsor had been run through by a sword . i followed the bloodless wound , a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes .
i have misjudged you i think . i did not imagine you were so cruel .
no stone may be left unturned . it may appear harsh ...
why would you do such a thing ?
wo n't they still have that justice ? or , was it a vain promise ?
they have done nothing of the sort .
people have put their trust in you .
if these are the random stalkings of a monster , what good am i ?
you promised justice .
that would be a pity . those words might show you something you 've never seen before .
very well . but , it will only sit gathering dust .
i insist that you have it .
thank you . no . here ...
then , i also have a gift for you . true magic which even you will not be able to deny .
if you want . but ...
oh , you are hopeless . may i keep it at least ?
do n't you see why ? look closely a moment . put your intellect aside . ca n't you see what is inexplicable ?
yes , but listen . the illusion is easily explained . the eye retains each image , till they combine . and yet , some would call this toy magic .
you made this , and the drawings ?
he only appears to be inside the cage . the point being ...
yes , he does . may i try ?
here it is . a bird on one side . his cage on the other . now , stare at it . the bird seems to be in his cage .
it would be interesting to find out .
i have had them since childhood . i can not remember what from .
these scars . how did you get them ?
i , um ... i have something to show you , if you have a moment .
you pay great attention to small things . i hide these as i hide all my books . father would not approve , lest it were the bible .
may i ask ... why do you cover your book that way ?
you do not disturb me . please stay . having trouble sleeping ?
you are funny .
poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions .
really ? then ... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom , or even in a teardrop ?
there is no such thing as magic .
to call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic , but not all magic is black .
are you so superstitious ?
not all think it is the horseman . many say witches come from the western woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons . some believe a person in this very town kneels before lucifer , offering death as tribute . and , still others believe none of it .
extra ordinary , yes . but first , you tell me about the headless horseman .
i 've read a great deal about your new york city . do be a dear and tell me all about it . sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life .
which may explain his temperament . to have asked twice means the answer was `` no '' at least once .
he has proposed to me twice .
the massive fellow ... brom . for someone you call `` friend , '' he misplaces a good portion of jealousy .
my suitor ?
perhaps it is because your suitor 's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat .
is it me , or are you this nervous around all women ?
it might have been more . might have been positively grand talk .
small talk .
other people ?
excuse me ... i should apologize . i , um ... i ... have no great love of ...
well , i intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend brom van brunt , but it seems i 've made matters worse . i 'll leave you to your business .
feel free to form your own opinion . though it appears you already have .
you are horribly old-fashioned , are n't you ?
do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men 's beds ?
did they tell ? it is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone . according to the elders , an indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken , and spells cast then still linger to this day .
i ... i am looking for baltus van tassel .
forgive me , i did n't know .
yes ... yes . i think i will ...
let her go !
you can not kill what is already dead .
what ... ?
i know you saw me .
it is fine . now , i must ...
look closer . do you have anything to clean it with ?
it appears well . it has already clotted .
very little . i must be going ...
she has taken the last of our grain to be milled . you do have a background in the medical arts , do n't you , constable ?
where ?
no . she has gone out .
excuse me , lady van tassel ... katrina is not in her room .
as my husband says , a wife should be always like an echo , and at the same time , quite unlike an echo . like an echo , she should speak only when spoken to , and unlike an echo , should never try to have the last word , or , at least that is what he believes .
do you know ... i think those are the first words i have heard from you my entire time here .
use caution .
yes , actually .
returning to the western woods ?
it is a prime tenet of science , philipse , that because one thing appears improbable does not mean you embrace the utterly fantastical .
you said yourself . what mere man could have downed the belltower ?
yes . here ...
van ripper ... do you have a gun ?
turn around . now !
what did you say ?
van ripper , turn the coach about !
i did n't see none .
there was not much blood , was there ?
to the best of your recollection , where did the open wound fall ?
here ... in front of this oak , facing north . horrible ...
i can show exactly .
van ripper . can you show where the body lay ?
close your mouth ! keep silent .
what ... what are you doing ?
you want to see into the nether world ... i can show you . whatever you see , do not move or speak . i will hold him .
can you help ?
sit .
the horseman . yes .
i hear him . he rides to the hollow and back .
leave me . you are not welcome here .
the lenape who lived in these woods ... do you know him ? the redman ? i should tell you ... he has been murdered .
in a way , yes .
you are from the hollow ?
pardon . you did not answer when i knocked . are we intruding ?
this whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon . but ... i am not going to kill you . not me ...
no one will believe your lies , whore .
imagine my surprise , finding him on a liason with a common servant . a girl who had apparently become his secret love .
he saw me thrown ... saw the horseman looming over me as i fled . things i wanted him to see . but , as long as i govern the horseman , he can not harm me . baltus did not stay enough to see that . he ran as a coward , unfettered by my fate .
father saw you die .
he rides tonight .
am i ? or , are you and young masbath dead along with me ?
you ... you are alive .
doctor , he is awake .
lay still , ichabod . do not move .
she has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession . do you know what confession is ? all that is left for you now is to pray for her soul .
no .
she has confessed .
no , sir , please ... she is innocent ...
she is guilty .
she did not do it ... please listen ...
you do not want to be here . go home to your father .
may i see my mother ?
go home .
goddamnit , scooter , come on . pardon my language , ma'am .
i can go . you do n't have to . you do n't never go .
well , yeah it 's a classic . you know , karl , i got to thinkin ' about it last night and it 's just not christian of me to not let you have a key . i mean you been in lockup so long , you do n't need me keepin ' you locked up . you need to come and go as you please . here , take this key , it 'll get you in and out that back door . them french fries good ?
yeah , that 's a goodun . i believe you did tell me that one before . i 've heard that a bunch . long time ago .
there was these two old boys hung their peckers off of a bridge to piss , one old boy from california and one old boy from arkansas . old boy from california says , `` boy this water 's cold . '' old boy from arkansas says `` yeah , and it 's deep too . '' get it ? that 's a goodun .
i ca n't remember .
scooter , did i tell about the two old boys pissin ' off the bridge ?
karl , they 's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with . now there 's one more thing . the way we lock these doors at night , you ca n't get out . you did n't want to go anywhere , did you ?
wait up , i 'll leave with you and lock up .
all right then , i 'll see y'all later . karl you done a good day 's work . they right about you . scooter , he 's gon na knock you out of a job if you 're not careful . i 'll see you tomorrow .
scooter , let 's me and you go over to dairy queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime .
thank ye .
see there . thinks of the simplest thing first .
hit ai n't got no gas in it .
you done fixed it ? i 'll be damned . scooter told me it could n't be fixed . 'course scooter 's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be . you done fixed it . i 'll just be damned . see you tomorrow .
i fixed it . hit 's a workin ' pretty good .
all right then . i 'll see you bright and early . how you comin ' along on that garden tiller ?
that boy wants me to .
now , karl , you sure you want to go stay with these folks ? you 're welcome to keep on stayin here . it 's workin ' out real good .
i 'll let you off while it 's still daylight .
all right then .
well , i 'm gon na pay you today for this comin ' week , so you 'll have some walkin ' around money . when you get off this evenin ' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin ' up supplies to have back there . some hard candy and some magazines . somethin ' to keep you busy at night .
they give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose . i spent up some of it on ridin ' the bus and eatin ' french-fried potaters .
you got any money ?
yeah , they 's good all right .
if it works out and all , maybe we 'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to . see you later .
i do n't reckon .
yeah , me too .
i like them french-fried potaters .
we order from dairy queen at noontime usually . we can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little .
i 've tinkered around on 'em a little bit .
they say you 're a whiz on fixin ' lawn mowers and things .
now it 's minimal wage and there ai n't nothin ' but a army cot and a toilet back there .
thank ye .
okay , stop back by . do n't worry about your boy here , he 's doin ' good .
i 'll see you , bill .
sure .
can i see him ?
he 's gone to stayin ' over with that wheatley boy and his mama in their garage . i think that little boy adopted him damn near like a mascot . but he 's got a key here to come and go as he pleases . everything 's worked out good .
is him stayin ' here workin ' out ?
well , he 's pretty quiet . except for them rackets and breathin ' things he does . ai n't threatened me with a killin ' or anything . but boy you could n't of been more right about him fixin ' things . that son of a bitch is a regular eli whitney on a lawnmower . loves french fries . eats four larges and do n't even so much as belch . i 'm proud to have him .
just thought i 'd check on karl and see if everything 's working out .
doin ' pretty good . got a sick tiller here . what 's got you down this way ?
how are you , bill ?
how 'bout you , jerry .
good to know you , karl .
karl , come over here . i want you to meet your new boss . this is bill cox , runs this place . says you can work here and stay in the back .
well , i 've got a roomful of work for him to do . ca n't get scooter to do any of it .
he wo n't steal . i 'm tellin ' you he 's a pretty good ol ' boy . keeps to himself .
fine with me . if he steals anything , i 'll take it out of your pocket anyway .
he wo n't have anything to do with him . now you say it 's all right for him to stay out here in the back ?
that old man of his still livin ' over there on clark street i believe .
well , i ai n't scared of him workin ' here . you know me . i 'm a church goin ' man . forgivin ' man . when your time 's up the lord 's gon na come git you . you seared of him , scooter ?
he 's a regular whiz at it . that 's all he did when he was a kid .
do n't look much like he could . you say he can fix a small engine like nobody 's bidness .
i remember it real well . cut them folks to pieces . his mama one of 'em .
no , do n't guess i do . scooter , good to meet you . this is him , the one i talked to you about on the phone . now like i said , i 'll understand if you get nervous about it . i 'm not gon na lie to you now , he did get in that trouble but then he was real young .
aw , pretty good . kids are drivin ' me crazy and phyliss is gon na put me in the poorhouse . ca n't complain other than that . would n't do any good if i did . do you know scooter , jerry ?
good to see you , bill . how 's everybody doin ' ?
hey jerry , how it 's goin ' . good to see you . been a long time .

how fer you going with them sacks full of warsh ?
i got a mama , but she 's at work over at ben 's dollar store . my daddy 's dead . he got hit by a train .
ai n't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it ?
yeah .

yeah .
french-fried potaters .
french fries . i like to eat them pretty good .
what do you like to eat here ?
well , i guess it 's all good .

they was a boy . we made friends .
... on the third day i washed her . she was n't very clean . i got all the right spots . she was the first one i ever kept for any length of time , you see i get bored easily , i have a short attention span . i ca n't say she enjoyed her stay , although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum . i do n't really like people who talk a lot . i like to do the talking . i guess that 's why i 'm so fond of you . you 're so easygoing , although i do sense a little tension in you sometimes . by the way , how was it out there ? did you have any fun ? make any new acquaintances ? tell me what it was like .

this is not your house , doyle . this is my house and i 'll say who stays and goes . you 've got a house , why do n't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it .
i thought i told everybody to get out of my house . that includes cocksuckers and retards . get off your asses and go .
but honey , i 'll be good . i promise . i love you sweetie . i 'm just tryin ' to help these two be part of things .
he do n't want to doyle . do n't go vaughan if you do n't want to . you 'll wreck doyle , you 're drunk .

let 's go , vaughan . frank , we 'll be back in a little while . i 'll bring you back somethin ' . you 're food 's in the oven warmin ' over .
frank , why do n't you go off and play in your room if doyle 's gon na talk nasty .
boy , ai n't you somethin ' else . talkin ' back and everything . it kinda makes me horny when you talk back .
you 're not crippled . get in there and make somethin ' .
ai n't that the sweetest thing . what am i supposed to do about supper with you traipsin ' around with that fag ?
he 'll be here in a little while , he 's takin ' me to get an ice cream .
you sure are hung up on people bein ' sweet . speakin ' of which , where 's your girlfriend ? i thought he was comin ' by here for something .
yeah , that 's right , frank , you better ask him . i mean , do n't hurt his feelin 's or anything , but it would be good to know . i 'm sure it 's nothin ' . he seems real sweet .
he had of went nuts and did somethin ' . they do n't put you in there for just bein ' a retard . they 's retards all over the place that ai n't in the nuthouse . do you know , frank ?
he 's just mentally retarded , i guess .
i ai n't sayin ' it 's right . i 'm just tellin ' the truth . what was he in the nuthouse for ?
doyle , you 're awful . you should n't be that way .
karl can stay if he wants to . mama said --
now here 's the deal . now that i 'm gon na throw my entire life away doin ' what i want to come live here with y'all , we have to get a few things straight . see , frank , me and you mama would n't have any problems if it wad n't for you . we 'd never have a bad word between us . but since you do exist , if i 'm gon na be here as the head of the household , we 'll have to live by my rules . and my rules are you do n't speak unless you 're spoken to . stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does . you 're a weird little shit . i do n't get you . so wake up . face what they call reality . we 're gon na be a family now . and it 's my family . i 'll be payin ' the bills so you got me . but i ai n't your daddy . you just treat me like i am . i 'm the boss , okay . and the other thing is your friend karl has to go . we ca n't have a normal family with him livin ' in the garage and comin ' in the bedroom at four in the mornin ' with hammers and shit . see ?
well , i hate you , too . no i do n't . i love your mama . nobody understands what i go through . i 'll leave . you bunch of freaks have fun . i 'll call you tomorrow honey . i 'm sorry . you can kiss my ass , really . you ever hit me again you little bastard and i 'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out .
i hate you !
okay , i 'll leave and sober up . everything 's botherin ' me , that 's all . i 'm hurtin ' linda . i love you .
that ai n't none of your damn bidness . besides that 's the way friends do one another . fuck it , i 'm gon na go call 'em . honey , find my guitar , i think it 's out there in the garage with that loony tune .
last time you got mad and run morris and them off and said to stay away from here .
i get nervous , that 's all i know .
what have you got to be nervous about ? you 're a damn kid . you ai n't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time .
do n't talk about daddy . y'all go on to the garage and let me be .
stop it , doyle ! do n't talk about daddy , you hear me !
you be quiet , frank , we 're talkin ' . the adults are talkin ' . were you in the lockup for cuttin ' somebody up with a hatchet ?
stop it , doyle !
goddamnit , i 'm talkin ' to the man . you set right there , karl .
come on , karl , let 's go out to the garage .
yeah , honey , let the kid watch t.v . hell , let 's all watch t.v . like a family till your retarded friend and your homosexual friend gets here .
i want to watch t.v .
you might want to find out . he might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin ' .
i ai n't sure .
no sir 's right . i 'm talkin ' to your mama . this is your mama 's decision , not yours . i 'm lettin ' it go on because she asked me , not you . now is this the kind of retard that drools and rubs shit in his hair and all that , 'cause i have trouble eatin ' around that kind of thing . just like i am about antique furniture and midgets . i ca n't so much as drink a glass of water around a midget or a piece of antique furniture . same thing with a droolin ' retard .
no sir .
now son , i wad n't talkin ' to you , was i ? was i ?
he 's real honest . he would n't steal nothin ' .
well , honey , i do n't guess i give a shit . i ai n't here half the time anyway . if you want a retard livin ' in the garage , i do n't guess i care . i 've got a good tool box and socket set out there i do n't want stol 'd . i guess i could take it home with me .
i thought i told you to keep out !
i 'm a witness . i heard you threaten her life .
that 's funny . you go to bed and take snot nose with you .
doyle , do n't you lay one hand on her .
i 'll kill you , you fuckin ' faggot ! you mind your own business . now get out ! now , before i get too mad to turn back .
it 's not your house , doyle , it 's linda 's .
we do n't have a goddamn band ! y'all just shut the fuck up ! we do n't need no practicin ' or managers cause we ai n't no fuckin ' band ! morris ai n't no genius and the rest of you are just losers . am i the only one sane human bein ' around here ? just get the hell out of my house and do n't come back !
if y'all do n't shut up i 'm gon na go out of my mind . and plus you 're liable to bust a spring in karl 's head . he 's already off balance .
i do n't really understand the meaning of the words .
what exactly do you mean by that ? i do n't understand .
you got that shit right .
sarcastic right ? you know the boys in the band are probably gon na stay over tonight . we 'd be glad to have you .
oh , yeah , i 'm thrilled .
i bet you like sittin ' between two men in a dual wheel truck do n't you ?
shhhh ! this is the national anthem .
are you sure you can drive ? you 've really had a lot of alcohol .
come on , do n't be a pussy . everybody has to work .
i 'd better go on home now , it 's late . i have to work tomorrow .
you enjoying yourself , karl ?
sure . it sounded like a number one tune all right .
you like that vaughan ?
that 's ridiculous . that 's just a total lie .
i heard you was more than friends . i heard dick rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin ' at it in the same room with poor , little , old mizz ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney .
i know albert . we 're friends .
hey , vaughan , you know what i heard ? i heard you been puttin ' it to albert sellers that works over at the funeral home .
do n't rush ever'body , honey .
sure , i guess .
i aim to kill you with it .
i told you to get away from here , did n't i ? i 'm tryin ' to relax and look at tv . what are you doin ' with that piece of iron ? i swear to god you 're the weirdest son of a bitch i ever heard of .
what numbers do you punch ?
pick up the fuckin ' phone and call 'em , i guess .
how does a feller go about gettin ' ahold of the police ?
where 's ever'body else ? you seen 'em ? i thought i told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway .
you shut up you , fuckin ' retard . get your shit and get out of here . that was a wake-up slap , frank . remember . reality , like i said . do n't forget any bit of what i said to you and we 'll be fine .
do n't hit that boy no more .
baptized ? well , get baptized then . i do n't give a shit . call a fuckin ' preacher , goddamnit ! i ca n't baptize you .
i want to be baptized .
karl childers just in from the state facility . make one of them gruntin ' sounds karl or whatever it is you do . oh well , karl 's a little retarded , he do n't know what the hell i 'm talkin ' about . and to vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients . now that takes balls . our number one tune for the folks , boys . kick it off johnson !

you 're just crazy in a retarded kind of way then . it would n't matter to me if you did do violence on somebody 'cause i ai n't afraid of shit . you think i 'm afraid for you to stay here . you 're just a humped over retard it looks like to me . not really , i 'm just jokin ' with you . welcome to our humble home , buddy . frank needs all the friends he can get . frank 's a real weak little kid . his daddy taught him how to be a pussy .
i ai n't never used no hatchet that i remember .
well , i ca n't understand none of it . this one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another . just how retarded are you ?

what 's all them books ?
this and that . toothpaste and whatnot .
what 's in your bag ?
i 'm closing the door now . i told you , i 'll see you later .

he 's gon na be around a lot and i hope you are too , so ...
why ? hi , karl .
i wanted for you to meet karl , too . he 's my new friend . but i feel like i 've always known him . i thought you should meet him .
they 're from the dollar store . i 'm not an idiot . besides we have a garden full of flowers .
i wanted to bring you some flowers . they 're pretty good ones .
hey frank . you should n't be coming over here . my parents really do n't want you to .
okay .
ever'thing 's okay , boy . i kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then i 'm gon na go on and leave here .

hit do n't make no difference where i was to be . we 'll always be friends . there ai n't no way to stop that . i aim for you to have these books .
i care for you , too . but you 'll be around , do n't say that .
i 'm tired , too , frank . if i ai n't around no more , it do n't mean i do n't care fer ye . i care for ye a good deal . i care for you more than anybody they is . we made friends right off the bat .
yeah , i guess so . i 'm real tired , you know that . a kid my age should n't be tired of things .
that feller 's a whole sight meaner than me . he 'd just whup the tar out of me .
karl , i ai n't tryin ' to say nothin ' bad about you , but why do n't you stop doyle when he gets that away ? you 're older than him . you 're strong , too . my daddy would n't let him do that to me and mama .
you 're just a boy . you ort not to use that sort of language .
you have to karl . you have to look out for me . you do n't let that son of a bitch run you off .
i 'm glad of it you was borned . i reckon i ai n't gon na be there in the garage no more .
just diggin ' . i ai n't ever gon na be happy now . not with that son of a bitch movin ' in for good . i wish me and you and mama could just run away . but she said he would find us wherever we went . he 's crazy . sometimes i think it would of been better if i wad n't ever born .
i knowed you 'd be here . what are you a-doin ' digging with that stob ?
hey , karl . how 'd you know to come out here ?
yes ma'am . i like a fried chicken leg .
yeah , i guess .
if i ai n't too stove up . i ai n't like you . i 'm old and give out . i 'm proud of ye .
can we play ever ' saturday ?
i wad n't thinkin ' about nothin ' else just like you told me i 'd do .
it was fun , anyhow .
no sir .
it do n't matter to me about us losin ' does it to you ?
you 're strong though . you let me make them touchdowns so i 'd feel good . my daddy used to do that kind of thing .
them boys was tryin ' to pull me down pretty hard .
i know you could of scored them three touchdowns by yourself instead of throwing 'em over to me .
we 're liable to win if we keep this up . for somebody like you , you sure run fast .
i dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so i figured i better give it off to you . i seen you over there follerin ' me .
way to go , karl . we got a touchdown . that was a good lateral , man . that was just like the wishbone .
yessir .
we 'll be on teams , me and you ?
yeah .
you will ? for sure ?
i 'll play ball with ye . i reckon if neither one of us is no count it wo n't make no difference .
is that right ?
bill cox is goin ' to a funeral for a mister turner tomorrow and a closin ' up shop early .
make believin ' always made me feel good too from time to time .
i feel sad about karen cross , too . i just make like to myself she loves me . i know better , though . it just feels good to me when i imagine it .
i do n't reckon i know . i ai n't found no way yet and i 'm three or four times as old as you . might be that 's just the way folks is .
seems like doyle 's wormed his way back in . mama said he 's stayin ' over tonight and he 's talkin ' about movin ' in for good . we ai n't ever gon na be happy . we 'll always be nervous , wo n't we karl ?
readin ' on this book on how to work carpentry . i aim to learn how to build things out of wood one of these times . i 've always been partial to wood buildin 's and cabinets and whatnot . these drawin 's they got here do n't make no sense to me so far . you seem like yore tails a'draggin ' a might . you got somethin ' wrong with ye ?
what you readin ' ?
i reckon .
she said she 'd see me later . that 's kinda good , right ?
yes sir , i reckon it does .
bible says the same thing about killin ' others , too .
i 've studied about it . the bible says not to or you end up goin ' to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades .
i did n't mean to say anything bad about you . i know you 're good . you did n't mean no harm . did you ever think about killin ' yourself on purpose like my daddy did ?
hits been hard thinkin ' about it . they ai n't a day goes by i do n't think about it . i kindly have a picture of it up in my head that i see . hit makes me sad , too . i have bad thoughts on it . i wished they was somethin ' i could of did , too . should n't no bad things happen to childern . all the ol ' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that 's growed up , the way i see it . i should n't of told you about that . a boy ort not hear about such things . it just kindly come out .
that makes me feel real sad . could n't you have done somethin ' , karl ? i would have . i wish i would of had him . he 'd be here right now . livin ' .
i wad n't but six or eight . i reckon i did n't know what to do . i did n't know how to care for no baby . mama and daddy did n't want him . they learned me to do what they told me to . these days i figure it might of been best to give him right back to the good lord right off the bat anyhow .
that do n't seem right . it seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother .
i heared it cryin ' a little through that box .
it was still alive when you buried it ?
i did n't feel right about doin ' that . i takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there . that seemed more proper to me , i reckon .
you threw it in a trash barrel ?
a little ol ' boy .
a boy or girl ?
yes sir . right then it was .
it was alive ?
my daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin ' in it . i went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin ' movin ' in it . hit was bloody-like around that towel . hit was a little ol ' bitty baby , no bigger than a squirrel .
so it died when it come out ?
hit was borned a little too early on . my mother and father made hit come too early some way or other . i reckon they changed their mind about havin ' another'n . i was about six or eight year old then and they did n't care too much for me so i reckon they did n't need somethin ' else to worry 'em with .
why ?
yeah .
why not ? it died ?
i had one there for little bit . hit did n't get old enough to play with .
'cause it 's fun . it do n't matter if you ai n't no good . it takes your mind off of everything else while you 're doin ' it . when you run real fast tryin ' to make a touchdown you do n't think about anything else . i ai n't no good , but my daddy always said he was proud of me when i threw a ball or ran with it . did you have any brothers and sisters growin ' up to play with ?
naw .
and then some people you do n't like right off . it 's funny . you know why i want you to play ball with me ?
i do n't reckon i know .
you do n't seem like a daddy . you seem like a brother . wonder what makes you like somebody right off when you do n't even know 'em like what happened with me and you .
he ai n't no count .
i kind of like you tellin ' me what to do and not to do . just like my daddy . i did n't mind him tellin ' me . i hate doyle to tell me what to do . mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us . that we ca n't leave him or he 'll try and hurt her .
you ort not to pull on yourself that away .
i did n't know till here while back a year or two ago when i spent the night with ronnie smart one time . he said just tug on your peter and think about your mama . i tried it , but i felt funny thinkin ' about my mama . so , i switched over to thinkin ' about his mama and then what he told me would happen , happened . it sure tingles , do n't it ?
yes sir . you ort not know that language .
oh , jackin ' off ?
pull on your works . your privates .
what do you mean ?
that 's real good . you ort not to if ye ai n't married to somebody . bible tells you that much . hit tells some things that do n't seem right too , i reckon . i guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can , though . you do n't touch yourself , do you ?
and i do n't try to touch her . you know , in a bad way . foolin ' around , sex and all .
naw .
just 'cause i 'm not rich do n't mean i do n't love her .
they ort to . you 're a good boy .
i usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they 're home . reckon why they do n't like me ?
i bet he will . i got a little money if he do n't . i 'll get 'em for ye .
i ai n't got no money to get 'em with but i bet vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store .
if you want me to .
would you go see her with me ? i kind of thought i might take her some flowers like that woman done you .
yeah , i recollect it .
you know that girl i told you about . the one i love .
all right then .
i was wantin ' to ask you somethin ' .
hit was right thoughty of her .
yeah , me too . that was nice of that woman to give you them flowers .
yeah , i reckon they did . hit like to tore me up when i read about that pore little cripple boy .
boy , folks sure had it rough back a long time ago , did n't they ?
all right then .
i 'm gettin ' tired of readin ' for a while .
yeah .
you want to go with me ?
that 's than un on christmas i was tellin ' you about .
it 's name 's a christmas carol .
naw . you can look at all my books you want to .
i was goin ' to the secret place . i borried one of your books to take down there . you ai n't mad , are you ?
that gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin ' with her .
where 'd you get them flowers ?
yeah .
hey karl , you off work ?
i like the way you talk .
i like the way you talk .
i reckon it tastes pretty good to me .
i do n't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it 's made out of .
i reckon if you want me to . i got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some .
will you stay here with us for a long time ?
he ort not to talk that away to you neither . he ai n't no count . he 's mean to you and your mama . yore mama and that feller that 's carryin ' me to get somethin ' d'eat 's gon na be back here directly .
well , i hate him .
you ort not to talk that way . you 're just a boy .
i 'd like to kill that son of a bitch . i hate him .
it 's okay if you 're lookin ' out for yourself . if it 's self-defense . was it self-defense ?
i growed up and got taught it ai n't right to kill nobody .
maybe they needed it .
i thought they was .
were they bad people ?
two people .
who did you kill ?
yeah , i did .
'cause he did n't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to . that 's what the letter said . he got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs . i thought he took care of us fine . karl , did you really kill somebody ?
why did he do that , reckon .
it ai n't the truth . he shot hisself with a shotgun on purpose .
yeah , i remember you a-tellin ' me that .
karl . you know when i said daddy got hit by a train .
she says it 's for the times when he 's good to her . she 's lonely since daddy died . she said sometimes she do n't know why . he threatened to kill her if she ever left him . my daddy would kill him if he was here and somebody was mean to mama . vaughan , he 's real good to mama . vaughan that you met . but he 's not able to do anything to doyle , he 's funny you know . not funny ha , ha , funny queer . he likes to go with men instead of women . that makes him not to be able to fight too good . he sure is nice though . he 's from st. louis . people who are queer can get along better in a big town . he got transferred here to work . but mama said the real reason he left is 'cause his daddy hated him . for bein ' the way he is . i wish he liked to go with women . i 'd rather him be mama 's boyfriend than doyle .
how come her to keep bein ' girlfriends and all with him if he 's mean to her ?
i 've had a lot of bad thoughts since my daddy died . sometimes i wish i was still real little and he was still here . my mama 's real good , but i wish i had both of 'em . when we went to memphis one time in the car , it was rainin ' so hard we could n't see the road . but i wad n't scared because i thought as long as daddy was drivin ' nothin ' could happen to us . i feel that way about mama now . mama has a boyfriend now . his name is doyle hargraves . he works construction so he makes a pretty good livin ' . he still do n't help mama out with any money though . he ai n't no good . he 's mean to her . he do n't like me at all . mama says it 's because he 's jealous i belong to my daddy instead of him . he stays with us all night sometimes , but he 's got his own house . somebody told me it 's so he can still have other girlfriends . i like it on the nights when he ai n't at our house . i 'm not so nervous then .
you do n't need to know all of that . you 're just a boy . you need to think about good thoughts while you 're still a boy . they 'll be plenty of time for the other .
how did your mama die ?
he never did want to . i figure he ai n't changed his mind much .
how do you know ?
my mother 's dead . my daddy 's s'posed to be around still . he do n't want to have nothin ' to do with me though .
they still around , your folks ?
naw . did n't have too much . enough to scrape by on , i reckon .
this is what i call my secret place 'cause i come out here when i feel like bein ' by myself . i used to come here with karen cross . she 's kind of like my girlfriend , or used to be . she says she likes jerry maroney now . but i 'm gon na get her back 'cause i love her . we used to come here and hold hands and talk and read books to each other with a flashlight . she did n't want to have anything to do with me in front of other people 'cause i do n't have any money . well , mama and me , i mean . she seemed to like me a whole lot when we were out here though . she said she loved me , too . out here . settin ' right on that stump you 're on . see , her daddy 's a dentist so they 're rich . so 's jerry maroney 's daddy . he owns the ice plant . was your folks well off ?
they sell some of everything . come on let 's go . i wo n't tell her about you bein ' in the state hospital for killin ' .
i was kindly needin ' to do some tradin ' . reckon they sell toothpaste ?
aw , come on . you 'll like her . she 's real nice . she 'll give us somethin ' if we ask her to . candy or somethin ' .
i do n't want to worry your mama with company .
wait a minute . you want to go with me ? you can meet my mama .
all right then .
well , anyhow , i was just fixin ' to go see my mama down at ben 's dollar store . she 's workin ' two till eight .
i ai n't no good at it . i just come by .
did you want to play ball with us ?
you told me to come by .
yeah . what you doin ' by here ?
yeah it is . your name 's frank .
hey there . i thought i heard somebody on the porch . was n't your name karl ?
me and the burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time . if you ever want to come by and play . we ai n't no good either . well , i 'll see you later .
i never was much count at it . i never did get picked out fer it .
do you like to play football ?
you do n't seem like you 'd kill nobody .
i reckon i feel all right .
are you well ?
they told me i was well . they had to turn me loose .
how come ?
yeah .
they let you out ?
i killed some folks quite awhile back . they said i wad n't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin ' me in jail .
why 'd you live there ?
i did live there in the state hospital .
do n't you live somewhere ?
ai n't got nowhere to set 'em down .
how come you 're carryin ' them around with you .
different ones . one 's the bible . one of 'ems a book on christmas . one of 'ems how to be a carpenter .
what are all them books ?
childers .
what 's you last name ?
we 've had a real hard life , too , mama .
i know honey . just remember what i said , we 'll bide our time . you just steer clear of him as much as you can . doyle 's had a real hard life . it 's just about run him crazy i think .
he 's lyin ' mama . he ai n't gon na do better .
well , at least he 's tryin ' . but who knows for how long .
i love you , too , mama .
i promise we 're gon na get away from him . the time has to be right , that 's all . i 'd rather him get tired of me and leave me . then he would n't want to hurt me . he would n't care then . we 'll be fine . i promise . you go to bed now . i love you .
doyle would n't really kill you , would he ?
yeah , honey , someday everything 's gon na be all right .
is everything gon na be all right someday ? i just stay nervous all the time just about .
huh ?
mama ?
i know he does .
i bet he do n't . karl likes me .
i guess . he went to the garage . poor thing , he 's probably never seen such a crazy mess . he probably wants to go back and live in mr. cox 's shop .
did karl go to bed ?
yeah , he has to go to work in a little while . i do too .
did vaughan go home ?
what are you doin ' up again , frank ? you need to get a little sleep .
no , honey , we do n't . i 'll make some coffee and start cleanin ' up this mess . karl , you want some coffee , huh ?
we do n't need to think bad thoughts , do we mama ?
i 'm fine , honey . let 's just try and forget about tonight .
you all right , mama ?
he ai n't ever okay to me .
he 's no more an indian than i am though . anyhow , doyle 's gon na try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends . just like he does to frank and me sometimes . you just ignore it . or stay out here away from 'em if he 'll let you . he 's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he 'll get drunk . i guarantee it .
they ai n't even no good . the only one can play is randy horsefeathers . he claims he 's an indian . his real name 's randy collins and he works at the feed mill . he can at least play guitar .
karl , now listen , there 's gon na be a party tonight here at the house . doyle 's invited his music-playin ' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio .
i 'm glad of it , honey .
i sure like the way he talks . it sounds like a race car motor idlin ' . it makes me not be nervous .
i do n't know . he just said he 'd eat out there .
how come karl wo n't eat here with us ?
naw , i do n't want to . me and karl got things we need to do .
maybe you and karl want to go with us ?
frank told me about your situation . and frank loves company . you know , especially after his daddy passed and all . there ai n't no sense in you stayin ' in that old greasy shop . he 's mentally retarded , poor thing .
hey karl , guess what . mama said you can stay with us . out in the garage . our car wo n't fit in there anyway . it 's real neat .
nice to meet you , karl .
oh , that 's karl . i met him at the laundrymat . karl , this is my mama . and vaughan , vaughan 's the manager . he lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they 're best friends .
hey , sweetheart . what you up to ?
hey , mama . hey , vaughan .
me , too .
flowers is pretty . i 've always thought that .
yeah .
a blister shore can hurt .
i ai n't really thought about it too much i do n't reckon .
these is the worst shoes i own for walkin ' . how far did you want to go ?
i reckon .
you walk fast , do n't you ?
i stay on my feet all the time at work . i just ca n't find shoes that 's comfortable .
i like walkin ' quite a bit from time to time .
well , when you like pricing items as much as i do , i guess it 's just bound to happen sooner or later .
yes ma'am , i reckon .
i told you , i ai n't got no boy , now get on out from here and let me be .
that grass out in the yard 's all growed up . i figured i might cut it fer ye .
they turned me aloose from the nervous hospital . said i was well .
i ai n't got no boy .
i 'm ye oldest boy name karl .
i ai n't got no boy .
i 'm ye boy .
i knew you 'd do all right . well , i just wanted to check on you . i 'll say bye to bill and get on back .
that boy , he 's my friend . he likes the way i talk and i like the way he talks .
i 'll be .
i told 'em about it . they know i 'm well . that mizz wheatley made me some biscuits .
yeah .
my history .
do they know about you ?
yes sir .
are you sure you 're okay staying with that woman and boy ?
well , i guess we better hit the road .
yes sir .
did n't you go to sleep at all , karl ? you been sittin ' there like that all night ?
yes sir .
karl , you up ?
he 's a-carryin ' me to look fer work in millsburg where i was borned .
she 's talkin ' about me , karl . that 's my first name .
i reckon i can just walk around till the mornin ' . or set and read me a book somewhere .
no , i mean your past . about why you were in here . i 'll take you first thing in the mornin ' . you have anyplace you can stay tonight at all ? i just ca n't let you stay here . it 's the rules . if something happened well , i 'd be liable .
i never was no good with history .
i ca n't promise he 'll hire you . i 'll have to tell him about your history .
i reckon .
i know , i 've seen it myself . would you give that a try ?
i 'm pretty handy i reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot .
listen , karl , the truth is i do n't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do . if it was up to me , i 'd let you stay here if that 's what you wanted . i 'm just doin ' my job . you follow me ? listen , i know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in millsburg . he used to go to church with me . you 're good workin ' on small engines and things . if i put my neck out for you with him , will you work at it if he 'll hire you ?
naw . never did know too much of nobody . not to he'p me out anyway .
your daddy 's still livin ' down there from what you told me . i guess he would n't help you any , would he ? i was n't thinking . you do n't know anybody ?
naw .
well , you have to learn . it 'll take some time . do n't you know anybody down there to help you out ?
i reckon i do n't care nothin ' about bein ' a free man . i do n't know how to go about it .
well , you ca n't do that . you 're a free man . you 've been let out to do as you please .
i want to come back and stay here .
karl , what in the world are you doing here ?
all right then .
you better go get 'em .
i ai n't got nothing but them books .
you better go get your things .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to them lookin ' at me , too .
yes , i guess you are .
i reckon i 'm gon na have to get used to looking at pretty people .
thank ye . i 'm just getting around to tellin ' you , but i fixed your warshin ' machine .
we sure like havin ' you .
you 've been real good to me , too . it ai n't ever'body that 'd make biscuits in the middle of the night . you and that boy has give me a good feelin ' .
well thank you , hun . that 's real good of you to say . i would n't know what to do without him either .
you 're a good mama to that boy . you care for him . you work hard fer him to take care of him . you light him up in his eyes , i 've seen it . he would n't know what to do without ye .
yeah .
ma'am ?
all right then . well , i 'll see you later . if you see frank , tell him to come on back home . i do n't get to see him all day except sundays . he can play tomorrow .
he wanted to go off and play , i reckon . you go in there and you and that doyle eat ye dinner . you do n't have to worry yourself none .
where 'd he go ? what 's goin ' on ?
frank , he went off , too . he ai n't gon na be in there when you get indoors .
well , okay . i got you some .
no ma'am . i 'm a'goin ' off sommers .
where are you goin ' , karl ? did n't you want some chicken and things ?
i could shore use some . thank ye .
you 're a hell of a boy , frank . someday you 're gon na get all the good things you deserve . and karl here 's gon na get some more biscuits tonight . what do you think about that ?
all right then .
karl , why do n't you and melinda go take a walk . it 's nice out .
i believe you . i really do .
yes ma'am . i like your garage . i would n't never hurt you or your boy . i 'd lay my hand on the bible and say the same thing .
was that you ? i remember that . i was only three or four , but i always heard about it growin ' up . they say you 're well ?
i killed my mother and a old boy name jesse dixon . i thought they was a-doin ' wrong . i was about your boy 's age . they say i 'm well now from it .
that 's okay . it 's not really my business . i have wondered though . why was it ? was it like a nervous breakdown ?
hit ai n't right for me to keep from tellin ' you how come me to be put in the state hospital .
i like frank . he 's a good boy . me and him 's made friends .
vaughan 's `` friend '' will be there , too . he works at the funeral home . and frank . you know frank likes you a lot . he says you make him feel calm .
i would n't mind a havin ' supper .
it 's all right . you know i was thinkin ' there 's this girl that works with me . she 's real heavy , but she 's cute in the face . well , you know , she 's slow . she 's a little bit , i think . she 's not retarded , just -- it do n't matter , listen to me . i thought you might like to meet her . vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her . would you like that ?
thank ye .
okay .
mustard 's good on 'em to me .
well , set down and i 'll make some biscuits and gravy .
yes ma'am .
well , it is nearly breakfast time anyway . i ca n't go to sleep . i have to be at work in three hours . you know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two , you feel worse than if you had n't slept at all ?
just whenever you take a notion to . i do n't aim to put you out .
right now ?
do you reckon you can make me some biscuits ?
i 'll be dog .
two fellers was on a bridge a takin ' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water . one of 'em came from arkansas , i believe .
no ma'am .
want to sit down ? did you need somethin ' ?
i did n't aim to .
you scared me .
karl , this is my boyfriend , doyle . frank , why do n't you and karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin ' . vaughan , you ready to go ?
tolerable , i reckon .
hey , vaughan . how are you , karl ?
i do n't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy . you 've been real square dealin ' with me . the bible says two men ort not lay together . but i 'll bet you the good lord would n't send nobody like you to hades . some folks calls it hell , i call it hades . that boy lives inside of his own heart . hits an awful big place . you take care of that boy .
what about you , karl ? do you want to stay here ?
naw , not yet . i want ye to give this to mizz wheatley . hit ai n't much , but maybe there 's a little somethin ' to hep out . hits what i 've earned fixin ' lawnmowers and whatnot fer bill cox .
well , sure , okay . he has n't hurt them , has he ?
that dern doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin ' and bein ' mean to folks . will you give me your word you 'll do it ?
what 's wrong ? is everything okay ?
this evenin ' i want you to go get mizz wheatley and that frank and have them stay with you tonight .
okay .
i ai n't a-stayin ' . i need to ast you fer a favor .
karl , what are you doing here ? come in .
i ai n't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em . i ca n't understand a lot of what i try to read . my mind , hit wonders off to somethin ' else when i try to read .
i think karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually . you should see all the books he has . he must read constantly .
before that i was thinkin ' it 'd be good if i could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry .
oh . how about before that ?
i was thinkin ' i could use me another helpin ' of these potaters .
that 's what i thought . i hope i have n't offended you in any way . you seem like a thinker . you seem to always be in deep thought . tell me something . what are you thinking right now ?
i would n't never hurt them .
anyway , it 's hard to live gay , that 's the right way to say it , in a small town like this . i 've wanted to leave many times , but my love for linda and frank and another certain person that we wo n't go into have kept me from it . anyway , i 'm rambling . if you 're going to live in the wheatly garage you need to know that it wo n't be easy . doyle is a monster . not just a closed minded redneck , but a monster . a dangerous person . i 've told linda that one day that man is going to really hurt her or that boy . maybe even kill one of them . i see it in his eyes . i 'm very in tune , maybe even psychic . doyle will make your life hell . you 're a perfect target . when i first saw you i was afraid of you . not really afraid , i guess , just taken aback . but also , i felt a real sensitive feeling from you . and for some reason , frank has adopted you . much like a stray animal . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it like that . in a good way . anyway , i just want you to know what you 're in for . i have a good feeling about you . you 're good for frank . maybe it 's that he can have an adult friend on a child 's level . i 'm sorry , i did n't mean it in a bad way . there 's one more thing . it 's none of my business why you were in the state hospital . everyone has something in their past , maybe you tried suicide , maybe you did something -- terrible . but what i see before me is a gentle , simple man . all i want you to promise me is that you 're capable of being around linda and frank . you know . you would never hurt them under any circumstances , would you ?
i 've heard it said that way .
well that 's a very offensive way to put it . you should n't say that . you were taught that , were n't you ?
not funny , ha , ha , funny queer .
homosexual . i like men . sexually .
i reckon not .
okay , karl , the reason i brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind . i guess i 'll put it right out on the table . where do i start . linda and frank are very important to me . they 're like family . my own family was never like family . they 're horrible people . as a matter of fact i prayed every night for years that my father would die . i finally realized through a lot of therapy that i was wasting my energy on hating him . now i just do n't care . you see , you and i are a lot alike , strange as that may seem . i mean not physically or even mentally really , just well , maybe emotionally or actually the hand we 've been dealt in life . we 're different . people see us as being different anyway . you 're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and i , well mine 's not as easy to see . i 'm just going to say it . i 'm gay . does that surprise you ? that i 'm gay . you know what being gay is , do n't you ?
okay , i 'll come by mr. cox 's and get you at noon .
i reckon i can stand to eat a little somethin ' or 'nother at noontime tomorrow . bill cox generally gets me a box of french fried potaters . but i reckon he can lay off doin ' it tomorrow .
i mean tomorrow or the next day .
i done et just a little bit ago .
listen , before you get very used to staying here , i think you and i need to talk about a few things . can i take you to lunch ?
quite a spell , i reckon .
how long have you been standing here ?
naw , i ai n't .
did you knock on the door yet ?
that boy wants me to .
so , you 're really going to stay here ?
yes sir .
not really to speak of .
do you have family here ?
i reckon mr. woolridge got me hired on to work for bill cox 's outfit .
is that right ? are you going to be staying here long ?
they turned me loose from the state hospital .
why are you here now ?
what 's that you say ?
what brings you back ?
i 's horned and raised here up till i 's twelve year old .
it 's been here seventeen years . did you live here before or something ?
naw , i do n't believe you have . i do n't reckon i never been in here . this store did n't used to be here .
i do n't think i 've ever seen you before .
that 's very sweet of you vaughan . we care about you , too . do n't we y'all ?
listen everybody , i know this may sound corny , i 've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional , but i 'm going to say it anyway . it just came over me in a rush . i want you all to know that i care about each and every one of you at this table .
i 'm sorry .
vaughan , do n't get pushy .
karl , maybe you and melinda might want to take a walk or something after dinner . it 's a nice night .
hey karl , you know what ? melinda was voted employee of the month at the dollar store last february . is n't that somethin ' ?
good . i have n't decided yet if i 'm a good cook .
karl is a guy guy ?
i do n't think he sees you as a guy guy .
what about me ?
he 's retarded 's all . you know he 's always after a father figure and lord knows doyle ai n't a good one with his mean ass .
he 's been in the state hospital a long time , something must be wrong with him .
frank 's just crazy about him . he likes the way he talks . he helped him carry home the clean laundry .
are you sure it 's safe to let him around that guy ?
i know .
he just got out of the state hospital .
can i help you , sir ?
frank , do n't talk that way . who 's that strange lookin ' man behind you ? did he follow you in here ?
why wo n't he talk to women ?
i thought you 'd be happy to leave .
no , we have to get this story .
let 's just go , marsha .
yeah .
do you smell shit ?
hey , you 're the one that wanted to major in journalism . anyhow , was n't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it , it was twenty-five years ago , he probably does n't even remember it .
in a few minutes we 're gon na be in a room with a killer . that does n't bother you ?
i do n't know why you 're so weirded out , this is not san quentin , it 's just a nuthouse . most of these people do n't even know where they are , they 're not gon na hurt you .
as much as anybody else is , i guess . y'all have a good rest of the day now .
will he be supervised ?
wherever he wants to . i think he 's going back to millsburg where he 's from . it 's just about twenty miles from here .
where will he go ?
i hope the best for you , miss dwiggins , with your school and your paper and all .
i did n't mean that .
we 've got some paperwork to take care of . pretty soon . do n't worry , you wo n't run into him in the parking lot .
is he leaving right this minute ?
homicidal signs . oh , we 're gon na change the light in here for karl . i hope you can see to write .
signs ?
he 's free . his time 's up . that 's the rules . he 's been treated and reevaluated . he does n't show any signs any more .
can i ask you a question ? if he 's so troubled , why are you letting him out ? what if he does it again ? it happens all the time .
it 's the best you 're gon na get . i 'm sorry .
how am i going to conduct an interview if i ca n't ask him any questions ?
but , here 's the thing . he 'll only talk to you . he does n't want you to ask him anything . and you should n't stare at him .
one of his daddy 's bible lessons i imagine . y'all pull up a chair . i 'll go out and talk to him .
that 's really strange . what does it mean ?
i do n't think so . just period , i think . she told him ... god gave them the ugliest creation he could think of . karl has an entire book -- a notebook . on every page it says `` franklin chapter 1 verse number 1 . '' he wrote that a few years ago after he 'd learned to write . his father 's name was franklin .
before they were married ?
his mother told him that he was their punishment . hers and his father 's ; from god , for having sex --
i knew he slept in a toolshed .
you see , karl , growing up , only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it . he could n't really read but , well , neither could his mother . but , his father made sure that his mother knew what the bible said . and she made sure karl knew . you know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed , right ?
melvin , go get karl and take him down to the old classroom .
ca n't you talk to him ? maybe talk him into it . i 'm a real good interviewer . just get me in the room with him .
well , what do we do ? we drove all the way out here .
i do n't know what to tell you . i 'm sorry . i made myself pretty clear i thought . he probably got busy and was n't thinking . i know how that is . i used to teach shop and eighth grade science .
the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man . karl wo n't talk to women .
no thank you .
karl 's real sensitive about having his picture made . he would n't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage . melvin , would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes ? you girls want some coffee ?
well , yeah , it 's for the school newspaper . but it has pictures . i mean it 's a regular paper , you know .
i think there must have been a little mix up . i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is , there could n't be any pictures . it 's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something , is n't that right ?
yes sir .
y'all have a seat . is this all of you ?
nice to meet you . i 'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans . she 's here to take the pictures .
my name 's jerry woolridge .
i think everybody at the store knows that already . they always talk about it . maureen ledbetter told a awful story about why you ai n't allowed over at the first baptist church no more .
yes .
you mean about y'all bein ' together in `` that '' way ?
well , a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors . unfortunately , i have to keep certain parts of my life private .
why ?
also , melinda , please do n't tell anybody at the store that albert was here tonight , okay .
no wonder it 's such a screwed-up place .
i once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the united states have at least one relative who has lived in brooklyn at one time or another .
like me , too .
actually , i 'm his father .
and what are you , his chaperone ?
three 's a crowd . yes , i 'm aware of that . but i have to keep an eye on mr. benjamin wherever he goes . to make sure he does n't get himself into trouble .
ah-hah , i see . a cozy dinner . but are n't threesomes a little awkward ? how does the phrase go --
i would n't actually call it a party . it 's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday . the guest list is quite restricted . so far , there 's mr. benjamin and myself . if you accept , that would make three of us .
and how many people will be attending this birthday party ?
it 's my birthday .
and what 's the occasion of this celebration ?
an invitation ?
good . then may i have the honor of extending an invitation to you ?
no ! at least i do n't think i am !
perhaps i should rephrase the question . what i mean to say is , are you married or seriously involved with a significant other ?
what !
wonderful . when your next book is published , maybe you could come into the store and do a signing . i 'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up .
it 's coming along . at the rate he 's going , he 'll have a story finished by the end of the summer .
forty-one pages .
okay . i 'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow . it does n't seem to be too long .
uh ... actually , it might be better if you read the story first . call me when you 're finished , okay ?
i get off for lunch in ten minutes . can i treat you to a hamburger ?
good . i hope you like it . it was a long time in coming .
i 'd love to .
i finished my story . i thought you might want to take a look at it .
almost done . a week or ten days , and i 'll be there .
yeah , well , i 've sort of been out of commission . how 's melville ?
it 's been a while . i thought maybe you 'd be in touch .
i 'll tell you all about it ... ... but not here .
what happened ?
it looks worse than it is . i 'm okay .
jesus , what happened to you ?
which explains why this has n't been the easiest summer of my life .
not an easy book .
that 's the subject of my last chapter .
melville , huh ? it 's been a while .
of course i fool around . but not so much when it comes to my work , it 's true . have you ever read pierre , or the ambiguities ?
wow . you do n't fool around , do you ?
visions of utopia in nineteenth-century american fiction .
what else . of course , what else ? and what are you writing about for your thesis ?
american literature . what else ?
your dissertation ? what subject do you study ?
it 's just a summer job . something to help pay the bills while i finish my dissertation .
and the bookstore ? have you been working there long ?
just like me .
muncie , indiana . he and my mother met as students . but i 'm from brooklyn . my sisters and i were all born and bred right here .
and your father ? is he from new york ?
until she was twelve . she moved here in 'forty-nine .
so your mother grew up in shanghai ?
i keep waiting for the next novel to come out . anything in the works ?
i confess .
i thought i recognized you . you 're paul benjamin the writer , are n't you ?
better make it charge .
will that be cash or charge ?
thanks . i knew you 'd understand .
uh , sure , sol . anything you say . instead of saying , `` one corned beef sandwich , '' and then , `` another corned beef sandwich , '' i 'll say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . ''
it 's simpler , that 's what . it makes things go faster .
what 's the difference ?
next time , when you want two corned beef sandwiches , say , `` two corned beef sandwiches . '' when you want two ginger ales , say , `` two ginger ales . ''
what 's that , sol ?
do me a favor , will you ?
for me ? i 'll have the same thing .
what about for you ?
huh ?
and what about for you ?
uh ... my friend over here would like a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale .
what 'll it be , auggie ?
exactly . life just would n't be worth living , would it ?
shit . if you ca n't share your secrets with your friends , what kind of friend are you ?
i mean , it 's a good story .
what do you mean ?
yes , i suppose i do .
and now you 've got your christmas story , do n't you ?
i would n't say that . but at least you 've put the camera to good use .
anything for art , eh , paul ?
you made her happy . and the camera was stolen anyway . it 's not as if the person you took it from really owned it .
i lied to her , and then i stole from her . i do n't see how you can call that a good deed .
it was a good deed , auggie . it was a nice thing you did for her .
i guess so . i never thought of it that way .
which means that she spent her last christmas with you .
yeah , probably .
she probably died .
once , about three or four months later . i felt so bad about stealing the camera , i had n't even used it yet . i finally made up my mind to return it , but granny ethel was n't there anymore . someone else had moved into the apartment , and he could n't tell me where she was .
did you ever go back to see her ?
okay . so this is the story of how it happened . okay . it was the summer of 'seventy-six , back when i first started working for vinnie . the summer of the bicentennial . a kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store . he 's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt . it was crowded around the counter just then , so i did n't see him at first ... .
every word .
okay . you remember how you once asked me how i started taking pictures ? well , this is the story of how i got my first camera . as a matter of fact , it 's the only camera i 've ever had . are you following me so far ?
i 'm all ears .
ready . any time you are .
so . are we ready ?
you got it .
i have to pee . if the waiter comes , order me a corned beef on rye and a ginger ale , okay ?
take over the register while i 'm gone , okay , jimmy ?
it does n't have to be true . it just has to be good .
good ? of course . are you kidding ? i 'll tell you what . buy me lunch , my friend , and i 'll tell you the best christmas story you ever heard . how 's that ? and i guarantee every word of it is true .
anything good ?
christmas stories ? sure , i know a ton of 'em .
yeah , great . the problem is , i have four days to come up with something , and i do n't have a single idea . you know anything about christmas stories ?
that 's a feather in your cap , man . the paper of record .
fine . or it was until a couple of days ago . a guy from the new york times called and asked me to write a christmas story . they want to publish it on christmas day .
ah-hah .
yeah , i know , but i 'm trying to cut down . somebody 's worried about my health .
you usually get two .
uh , better make it one .
two , right ?
hi , auggie .
hey , man , how 's it going ?
we 'd better be . i have n't spent a night out of brooklyn in fourteen years , and i 'm not about to break my record now . besides , i 've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning .
it 's not a long drive . an hour , an hour and a half . we 'll be back in time for dinner .
it 's tommy 's . the sucker owed me a favor .
nice machine , auggie . where 'd you find it ?
nothing much . he said his socks and underpants were dirty , and would we mind driving up with his things . fucking kids , huh ? they take you for granted every time .
so what did he say when he called ?
or did n't . there 's no way of knowing , is there ?
that could be a good sign , though . it could mean that he got away .
i spoke to his aunt a couple of days ago , but she has n't heard from him either . it 's beginning to get a little scary .
not a peep .
you have n't heard from rashid , have you ?
for once in my life i managed to keep my mouth shut . there 's something to be said for that , i suppose .
fuckus my assus . they did some number on you .
no . the ... uh ... the bobbsey twins lit out when they heard the sirens . but at least they stopped playing that marimba duet on my skull . assaultus interruptus .
cops ? you mean they nabbed those cruds ?
it could have been worse . if the cops had n't come , i might not be standing here now .
fuck you , kid .
it 's written all over you like a neon sign . now say something nice to rashid to make him feel better .
you 're right . i just was n't sure you knew .
no , he 's not . you are .
he 's crazy .
do n't be an ass , auggie . he 's trying to make it up to you , ca n't you see that ?
if he 's got something to tell me , why do n't he tell it to me himself ?
he 's got something to tell you , auggie .
yeah , well , i 'm sorry too . it took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks , and now i 'm broke . i ca n't hardly pay for this beer . not to speak of having my credibility destroyed . do you understand what i 'm saying ? my credibility . so yeah , i 'm sorry , too . about as sorry as i 've ever been in my whole fucking life .
the kid 's sorry , auggie .
hey , kid . you interested in a job ? i just got word from your employment agency that you 're looking for a position in retail sales .
i 'm thinking about the kid . i 'm sure he 'd do a good job for you .
help ? hmm . it 's possible . what did you have in mind ?
hey , auggie , i 've just been thinking . you would n't need some help around the store , would you ? some summer help while vinnie 's gone ?
how old , kid ?
it 's his birthday so we decided to whoop it up a little .
so , what brings you to a dive like this ?
this is april lee , auggie . april , say hello to auggie wren .
hey , man , good to see you .
it 's ellen . look at her . look at my sweet darling .
yeah . there she is . she 's in quite a few from that year . she must have been on her way to work .
yeah , that 's what i 'd recommend . you know how it is . tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow , time creeps on its petty pace .
slow down , huh ?
they 're all the same , but each one is different from every other one . you 've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings . you 've got your summer light and your autumn light . you 've got your weekdays and your weekends . you 've got your people in overcoats and galoshes , and you 've got your people in shorts and t-shirts . sometimes the same people , sometimes different ones . and sometimes the different ones become the same , and the same ones disappear . the earth revolves around the sun , and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle .
but they 're all the same .
i mean , you 're going too fast . you 're hardly even looking at the pictures .
what do you mean ?
you 'll never get it if you do n't slow down , my friend .
it 's kind of overwhelming .
i do n't know , it just came to me . it 's my corner , after all . it 's just one little part of the world , but things happen there , too , just like everywhere else . it 's a record of my little spot .
amazing . i 'm not sure i get it , though . i mean , how did you ever come up with the idea to do this ... this project ?
it 's my project . what you 'd call my life 's work .
i 've never seen anything like it .
that 's right . more than four thousand pictures of the same place . the corner of 3rd street and seventh avenue at eight o'clock in the morning . four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather . that 's why i can never take a vacation . i 've got to be in my spot every morning . every morning in the same spot at the same time .
they 're all the same .
it can be arranged . seeing as how i 've read your books . i do n't see why i should n't share my pictures with you . it would be an honor .
i 'd like to see your pictures some day .
well , let 's not exaggerate . i take pictures . you line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter . no need to mess around with all that artisto crap .
a photographer ...
taking pictures ? it 's a long story . i 'd need two or three drinks to get through that one .
how 'd you get started ?
that 's what people see , but that ai n't necessarily what i am .
so you 're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter .
i guess you could call it a hobby . it does n't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it , but i do it every day . rain or shine , sleet or snow . sort of like the postman . sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job , and my job is just a way to support my hobby .
i did n't know you took pictures .
it 's mine all right . i 've owned that little sucker for a long time .
it 's yours ?
yeah , i did .
looks like someone forgot a camera .
no problem . it 's not as though i 'm rushing off to the opera or anything .
do you think i could buy some before you leave ?
you run out of schimmelpennincks ?
are you closed ?
i would n't think of it . see you around , fellas .
seven eighty-five out of twenty . take care of yourself now , and do n't do anything i would n't do .
not elizabeth the second , elizabeth the first . did you ever hear of sir walter raleigh ?
the queen of england ?
definitely . i suppose it all goes back to queen elizabeth .
the boys and i were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars . some interesting connections there , do n't you think ?
two tins of schimmelpennincks . and throw in a lighter while you 're at it .
hey , man . good to see you . what 'll it be today ?
hey , auggie . how 's it going ?
anything , auggie . just name it .
there 's just one thing i want to know .
i 'm sorry , baby . i ca n't help it .
fuck this angel shit . just take the dough , ruby . but no bawling , okay ? i ca n't stand people who blubber .
i ca n't believe it . oh god , i ca n't believe it . you 're an angel , auggie . an angel from heaven .
for keeps .
for keeps ?
it 's all yours , baby .
and you 're giving it to me ?
five thousand bucks .
jesus god , auggie . there 's money in here .
why do n't you open it and find out ?
what 's this ?
no , bully for you .
bully for you .
remember that business venture i was telling you about ? well , my tugboat came in . i 'm flush .
are you calling me a liar ? i 'm telling you i 'm broke . i do n't even have insurance on my goddamned car .
no you 're not .
i 'd never be able to talk her into it . and even if i could , those things cost money . and that 's just what i do n't have . i 'm flat out dead broke .
not if you got her into one of those rehab programs .
dream on , auggie . she 'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday .
she 's just a kid . there 's time for more babies later . after she grows up .
yeah ? and what else am i supposed to do ? there 's no baby anymore , and if she wants to throw away her life , that 's her business .
still , you ca n't just write her off .
i do n't have much choice , do i ? it 's pretty clear she does n't want me around .
so you 're just going to give up and go home ?
you told me you wanted to meet him . well , here he is .
jesus christ . this is all i need .
when i told her i was going to bring her father , she kind of melted . it 's the first time felicity 's talked nice to me since she left home . she 's dying to meet you , auggie .
cut it out . just cut it out , okay ? it 's starting to get on my nerves .
she looks just like you .
and what 's that supposed to mean ?
wait till you see her , auggie .
look , i 'm not saying you do n't have a daughter . it 's just that she 's not my daughter .
that i was n't bullshitting you , sweetheart . at least you 'll know i 've been telling the truth .
yeah , like what ?
relax , okay ? you do n't have to do anything . just go in there and pretend . it wo n't kill you to do a little favor like that . besides , you might even learn something .
i think you 'd better stop the car and let me out .
it was the only way , auggie . otherwise , she was n't going to let me see her .
you what ?
i told her she was going to meet her father .
dammit , auggie , do n't ask so many questions . just get in the car .
where to ?
just get in and shut up . i 'm not asking you to do anything . i just need you to come with me .
you do n't give up , do you ?
get in , auggie . i 've got something to show you .
i know you think i 'm lying to you , but i 'm not . every word i told you is the god 's honest truth .
you 're a cold-hearted bastard , are n't you ? how 'd you ever get so mean , auggie ?
nice try , old girl . i 'd like to help you out . you know , for old time 's sake . but all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture , and i have n't collected my profits yet . too bad . you caught me at the wrong time .
i thought i could handle it . i did n't want to bug you . i thought i could handle it on my own , but i could n't . she 's in real bad , auggie .
fifteen years ago ? it wo n't wash , pumpkin . no mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he 's a father . i was n't born yesterday , you know .
who the hell knows ? he dropped out of sight fifteen years ago .
good old frank . and how is fat mr. grease monkey these days ?
then why do you think i married frank ? i was already pregnant , and i did n't have much time . say what you like , but at least he gave my kid a name .
you 're conning me , sweetheart . i ai n't responsible for no baby .
and that 's how felicity came into the picture . during one of those two seconds .
a couple of moments , i 'll grant you that . a second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity .
it fizzled , baby . that 's the way it goes . but we had our times , did n't we ? it was n't all bad .
you were n't so lukewarm yourself . at least at first .
it was over with bill before you ever came home . maybe you do n't remember it now , but you were pretty hot to see me back then .
yeah , well , i lost my pen . by the time i got a new one , i was clean out of paper .
you did n't write to me for more than a year . what was i supposed to think ?
that 's what you told me when i shoplifted that necklace for you . you remember , baby , do n't you ? the judge gave me a choice : either go to the can or enlist . so , instead of going to college , i wind up in the navy for four years , i watch men lose their arms and legs , i nearly get my head blown off , and you , sweet ruby mcnutt , you run off and marry that asshole , bill .
why would i lie to you , auggie ? you think it was easy to come here and walk into this place ? why would i do it if i did n't have to ?
you 've suckered me before , darling , remember ? why should i believe you now ?
i do n't know who else to turn to , auggie .
i know what it means . that still do n't make it a good name .
it means `` happiness . ''
stop it , already . just stop all this crap right now . was that your idea to call her felicity ?
her name is felicity , and she just turned eighteen . she ran away from pittsburgh last year , and now she 's living in some shit-hole here in brooklyn with a guy named chico . strung out on crack , four months pregnant . i ca n't bear to think about that baby . our grandchild , auggie . just think of it . our grandchild .
our daughter ? is that what you said ? our daughter ? i mean , you might have a daughter , but i sure as hell do n't . and even if i did -- which i do n't -- she would n't be our daughter .
do n't rush me , okay ? you 're jumping to conclusions before i 've even said anything . and besides , it 's not for me . it 's for our daughter .
help , huh ? and i do n't suppose this help has anything to do with money , does it ?
like what you 're doing . i 'm not going to eat you up . i need your help , and if you keep staring at me like that . i might start screaming .
like what ?
do n't look at me like that . auggie . it gives me the creeps .
all right , sugar , what 's on your mind ?
you heard her , pipsqueak . the lady and i have private business to discuss . go outside and stand in front of the door . if anyone tries to come in , tell 'em we 're closed . you got that ?
this is private , auggie . just between you and i .
talk away , lady of my dreams . i 'm all ears .
i 've got something to talk to you about , and the least you can do is listen . you owe me that much . i drove all the way from pittsburgh to see you , and i 'm not going until you 've heard me out .
at least i 've stayed true to myself . which is more than i can say about some people .
you always were a son-of-a-bitch , were n't you ? a little weasel with a quick , dirty mouth .
and you think it looks better to go around dressed up like captain hook ?
i do n't want to talk about it . if you really want to know . i lost it . and i 'm not sorry i did . that eye was cursed , auggie , and it never gave me nothing but grief .
no i 'm not . i look like shit . and so do you , ruby . you look just awful . what 's with the patch , anyway ? what 'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin ?
you 're looking good , auggie .
is that all ? i thought it was about three hundred .
eighteen and a half years .
christ , ruby , it 's been so long . i figured you were dead .
okay , my man . love to the wife and kids , et cetera , et cetera . drop me a postcard if you can remember the address .
i 've got to get moving . terry will bust my chops if i 'm late . see you in september , auggie .
they come in , they go out . i 've got it planned to the last detail .
suit yourself . but do n't keep the boxes around here long .
it 's the law that 's buying . that 's what 's so beautiful about it . i mean , when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail ?
no thanks . i do n't care what you do , but just make sure you do n't get caught , okay ? the last i heard , it was still illegal to sell cuban cigars in this country .
it 's all set . my guy in miami said he 'd have them within the next few weeks . are you sure you do n't want to go in with me ? five thousand dollars outlay , a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return . a consortium of court street lawyers and judges . they 're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine cuban cigars .
speaking of which , are you still going ahead with that deal on the montecristos ?
tobacco today , sex tomorrow . in three or four years , it 'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers .
they catch you smoking tobacco , they 'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you .
enjoy it while you can , vin . pretty soon , they 're going to legislate us out of business anyway .
i should stop smoking these damn things is what i should do . the fuckers are going to kill me one day .
i try not to , anyway . it 's better for your health . i mean , look at you , vincent . you 're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on long island . you 're the guy with the white shoes and the white caddy and the white shag carpet . but you 've had two heart attacks , and i 'm still waiting for my first .
you do n't take anything seriously , do you ?
she made a play for me after i got back , but her glass eye kept interfering with my concentration . every time we got into a clinch , i 'd start thinking about that hole in her head , that empty socket with the glass eye in it . an eye that could n't see , an eye that could n't shed any tears . the minute i started thinking about it , mr. johnson would get all soft and small . and i ca n't see getting married if mr. johnson is n't going to be in tiptop shape .
lovely .
she upped and married some other cat after i joined the navy . by the time i got my discharge , though , she was divorced . her husband poked out her eye in a domestic quarrel .
sounds like another one of your stories to me .
ruby mcnutt . my one true love .
yeah , i know . to that girl who moved to pittsburgh .
i almost got married once .
shit . you should have been married to someone by now . you know , settled down somewhere with a kid or two , a nice steady job .
i do n't know . maybe because i love you so much , boss .
it 's pretty crazy , do n't you think ? i mean , a smart guy like you . what do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for ?
i do n't know . thirteen , fourteen years . something like that .
how long you been working for me , auggie ?
no problem , vinnie . everything 's under control . i could run this store in my sleep .
okay . i think everything 's set . you 've got the number for cape cod , right ? just in case something goes wrong .
what difference does it make ?
come on , come on , you yellow belly . the whole thing . first name and last name .
you 're a dumb , whacked-out little fuck , do you know that ?
to look at the dirty magazines . i can see all the naked women i want , and it does n't cost me a cent .
your job ? you 've got five thousand bucks . what do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for ?
so i can get my job back .
and why the hell would you give me money ?
what do you care where it comes from ? it 's yours .
shit . i do n't want your money , you little twerp . it 's probably stolen anyway .
no , it 's five thousand dollars .
what is this , some kind of joke ?
open it .
for me ? and what am i supposed to do with a paper bag ?
it 's for you .
this way , gentlemen . let 's retire to my office , shall we ?
a little . not much .
sure thing . see you later .
i 'll be back in about an hour . watch the register while i 'm gone , okay ?
ten o'clock tomorrow morning . i 'll be there .
come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we 'll talk about it , okay ? we 'll see what we can work out .
a job ? i definitely would n't turn down a job .
good . keep it up , and maybe one day you 'll grow up and become a great man like me .
definitely . i 'd say you 've hit the nail on the head .
seventeen ? i remember when i was seventeen . christ , i was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when i was seventeen . is that what you are , son ? one little whacked-out crazy fella ?
seventeen .
i thought maybe he was pretending .
of course it hurts . what does it look like ?
does it hurt ?
jesus , man , you 're one fucking mess .
sure , auggie . i follow . when you do n't know nothing , it 's like paradise . i know what that is . it 's after you 're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels .
... if it happens , it happens . if it does n't , it does n't . do you understand what i 'm saying ? you never know what 's going to happen next , and the moment you think you know , that 's the moment you do n't know a goddamn thing . that 's what we call a paradox . are you following me ?
okay , auggie , i got it . you do n't have to yell .
when i tell you it 's open . it 's open when i tell you it 's open !
sure , auggie , i got it . the store 's closed . and when do i tell them it 's open ?
i just do what you tell me , auggie . you tell me to sweep , so i sweep .
that 's how it is with sidewalks . people come , people go , and they all drop shit on the ground . as soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next , the first spot is dirty again .
huh ?
it 'll never be finished .
good , auggie . real good . all finished .
how 'd you do out there , jimmy ?
damned if i know . but it has a nice ring to it , do n't it ?
what does that mean ?
any time . and congratulations to you and your wife . just remember , though , in the immortal words of rudyard kipling : `` a woman is just a woman , but a cigar is a smoke .
thanks for the tip .
it 'll keep them fresh . if they get too dry , they 'll break . and you do n't want that to happen , do you ? tobacco is a plant , and it needs the same loving care you 'd give an orchid .
the refrigerator ?
a good choice . you would n't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers , would you ? remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out .
i think i 'll take them .
forty-four . they 're on special this week from the canary islands . a real bargain .
and these ?
fifty-six . that girl had on a corset .
and these ?
seventy-eight dollars . the girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties .
and how much are these ?
they do n't come cheap , son . these little honeys are works of art . rolled by hand in a tropical climate , most likely by an eighteen year old girl in a thin cotton dress with no underwear on . little beads of sweat forming in her naked cleavage . the smooth , delicate fingers nimbly turning out one masterpiece after another ...
henry told cyrus he 'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again . when henry makes a threat like that , people tend to take him seriously .
and he 's never tried to get in touch with his son ?
no , i do n't suppose it has . he was broken up like nobody 's business in that hospital when he found out louisa was dead .
it ca n't have been easy on him . walking around with that on his conscience all these years .
jesus had nothing to do with it . if he 'd been involved . he would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did .
jesus .
do n't put words in my mouth . what i 'm saying is she drove off in cyrus 's car and went to the five-spot lounge with him for a drink . what i 'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car , he was in no shape to drive . but he drove the car anyway , and before he could get her back to where she lived , the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck . louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed . cyrus lived , but he came out of it a cripple . his left arm was so mangled , the doctors had to cut it off . small punishment for what he did , if you ask me .
you mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind ?
his father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born . louisa was henry 's younger sister , and she and the baby moved in with us . four or five years go by , and then one day cyrus shows up out of the blue , tail between his legs , wanting to patch things up with louisa . i thought henry was going to tear cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door . they 're both big men , those two , and if they ever started to tangle , you 'd see some teeth jumping on the floor . i guarantee it ... so cyrus persuaded louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet . and the poor girl never came back .
those are pretty hostile words .
and nothing . thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said , `` i do n't have a father . as far as i 'm concerned , that son-of-a-bitch is dead . ''
and ?
i figured he had a right to know .
and you told your nephew about it ?
well , one thing i suppose , but i do n't think it has anything to do with this . a friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she 'd spotted thomas 's father working at some gas station outside of peekskill .
has anything happened lately ? anything unusual or unexpected ?
no thank you .
do you want something to drink ? a beer ? a glass of water ?
he 's in trouble , all right . but i do n't have any idea what it is .
i was about to get run over by a car , and your nephew pulled me back . he saved my life . i sensed he was in trouble , so i offered to put him up for a few days . maybe i should have pressed him a little more , i do n't know . i feel pretty stupid about it now .
which brings me back to my original question . what was he doing here in the first place ?
i should n't have let him go .
his mother 's dead , and he has n't seen his father in twelve years .
and his parents ?
he goes to john jay high school in brooklyn .
he does n't go to the trinity school ?
i always knew that boy had an imagination , but now he 's gone and made up a whole new life for himself . do you mind if i sit down ? he 's been living with me and his uncle henry since he was a baby . and we do n't live in manhattan . we live in boerum hill . in the projects .
that 's what he said . he told me he lived with his mother and father on east seventy-fourth street .
his parents ? is that what he told you ? his parents ?
as far as i know , he went back to his parents .
i just want to know where he is .
look , lady , that 's enough . if you do n't calm down . i 'm going to throw you out . do you hear me ? right now !
and what was he doing here in the first place ? that 's what i want to know . what 's a man like you messing around with a black boy like thomas for ? are you some kind of pervert , or what ?
well , whatever his name is , he 's not here anymore . he left two days ago , and i have n't heard from him since .
rashid ? rashid ! is that what he told you his name was ?
you mean rashid ?
thomas cole . thomas jefferson cole . my nephew .
i 'm telling you . i do n't know anyone named thomas .
do n't give me any of that . i know he 's been here . you ca n't fool me , mister .
thomas ? who 's thomas ?
i 'm looking for my nephew , thomas .
the damn lock 's broken again . and so you just barge in on strangers , is that what you do ? is that your game ?
what do you mean , how 'd i get in ? i pushed the door and walked in . what do you think ?
how the hell did you get into the building ?
i just want to know what your game is , mister , that 's all .
what can i do for you ?
is your name paul benjamin ?
you shut your mouth ! you shut your mouth now !
louisa vail . remember her , cyrus ?
i do n't like this . i do n't like it one bit .
are you making fun of me ? i wo n't be mocked . do you hear me ? i wo n't let no punk kid stand there and mock me !
thomas cole . my name is thomas jefferson cole .
thomas .
paul . rashid . thomas . which one is it ?
thomas .
that 's how we met . we 're members of the international same name club . believe it or not , there are 846 paul benjamins in america . but only two in the new york metropolitan area . that 's how paul and i got to be such good friends . we 're the only ones who show up at the meetings .
yeah , but he 's my son . nothing strange about that . he 's my own flesh and blood . but here you got the same name as this man here , and you 're not even the same color .
well , you and junior have the same name , too , do n't you ?
that 's funny . his name is the same as yours .
say hi to paul .
hi there , little brother .
and this one , in case you have n't guessed , is junior .
it 's only temporary . on a freelance basis .
that boy 's one in a million . a real tiger .
you named the kid after yourself , huh ?
i do n't know . i try . every day i keep on trying , but it 's no easy task for a man to change his nature . i 'm off the booze , though . have n't had a drop in six years . and now i 've got me a wife . doreen . best damned woman i 've ever known . and a little boy , too . cyrus junior . so things have definitely improved since i got fitted with this hook . if i can just turn this goddamn garage around , i 'll be in pretty good shape .
and have you mended them ?
an ugly piece of hardware , is n't it ? i 'll tell you what happened to my arm . i 'll tell you what happened . twelve years ago , god looked down on me and said , `` cyrus , you 're a bad , stupid , selfish man . first of all , i 'm going to fill your body with spirits , and then i 'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car , and then i 'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you . but you , cyrus , i 'm going to let you live , because living is a lot worse than death . and just so you do n't forget what you did to that poor girl , i 'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook . if i wanted to , i could rip off both your arms and both your legs , but i 'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm . every time you look at your hook , i want you to remember what a bad , stupid , selfish man you are . let that be a lesson to you , cyrus , a warning to mend your ways . ''
i do n't mean to be nosy , but i was wondering what happened to your arm .
paul . paul benjamin .
the name is cyrus cole .
five dollars an hour ? i 'll take it .
i 'm afraid we 'll be working on a strictly freelance basis .
you know , health insurance , dental plan , paid vacation . it 's not fun being exploited . workers have to stand up for their rights .
benefits ?
is there a benefits package , or are you hiring me on a freelance basis ?
five bucks an hour . that 's the going rate , is n't it ? it 's a quarter past two now . my wife 's picking me up at five-thirty , so that 'll give you about three hours . if you ca n't finish today , you can do the rest tomorrow .
what 's your offer ?
i 'll tell you what . you want to work . i 'll give you a job . nothing permanent , mind you , but that upstairs room over there -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess . it looks like they 've been throwing junk in there for twenty years , and it 's time it got cleaned up .
yeah , well , do your thinking somewhere else , michelangelo . i got work to do .
it was just a thought .
not a one . not one customer all day . i bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago , and if business do n't pick up soon , i 'm going straight down the skids . what do i want to be hiring someone for ? i ca n't even pay my own wages .
not a one .
do you have eyes in your head , or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles ? you 've been sitting here all day , and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas ?
i just tell it like it is , mister . if i 'm getting on your nerves , though , you might want to think about hiring me .
son-of-a-bitch . you 're some piece of work , are n't you ?
once you look at it , you 're going to want to buy it from me . that 's guaranteed . and that 's the price : five bucks . so if you 're not willing to spring for it , you might as well not bother to look . it 'll just tear you up inside and make you miserable .
five bucks ! you mean you 're going to charge me five bucks just to look at it ?
it 'll cost you five bucks .
it 's rundown , all right . but drawing a picture wo n't improve the way it looks . let 's see what you did , rembrandt .
i 'm working on a sketch . that old garage of yours is so rundown , it 's kind of interesting .
just passing through . a lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view . there 's other places to roam , kid , that 's all i 'm saying . you do n't want to make a nuisance of yourself .
just passing through .
i do n't know what you look like , boy . as far as i can tell , you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night . you live in this town -- or on your way from here to there ?
i 'm not going to rob you , mister . do i look like a thief ?
let me give you some useful information , son . there 's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there and considering all the time you 've put in casing the joint so far , you wo n't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains . however you slice it , that 's a losing proposition .
it 's a free country , is n't it ? as long as i 'm not trespassing on your property . i can stay here till kingdom come .
why do n't you pick some other spot ? it gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning .
i do n't know . i have n't decided yet .
you going to sit here all day ?
an abortion , stupid . i had an abortion the day before yesterday . so you do n't have to bug me about that shit anymore . bye-bye , baby !
what are you talking about ?
yeah , well , there ai n't no baby in there now . you dig ? there 's nothing in there now .
your baby . the baby you 're carrying around inside you .
baby ? and what baby is that ?
you can do whatever you want with your own life . we 're thinking of the baby , that 's all . we want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby . before it 's too late .
help ? what the fuck do i need your help for ? i 've got a man , do n't i ? that 's more than you can say for yourself , hawkeye .
be nice , sweetie . we 're just here to help you .
i do n't got no daddy , you dig ? i got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass .
i do n't know . hello , mom . hello , dad . something like that .
what do you want me to say ?
are n't you going to say anything ?
well what ?
well ?
it 's me , honey . it 's mom .
yeah ? who is it ?
i do n't know , tommy . you think anyone gives a rat 's ass about kuwait ? i read something about the head sheik over there . he marries a different virgin every friday and then divorces her on monday . you think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that ?
of course there 's gon na be a war . you think they 'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun ? i mean , there 's plenty of beach , but not a hell of a lot of water . half a million soldiers . it ai n't no seaside holiday , you can bet on that .
i used to smoke raleigh cigarettes . they came with a free gift coupon in every pack .
sure . he 's the guy who threw his cloak down over the puddle .
they did n't have to do a thing , that 's all i 'm saying . the team was good , the best fucking team in baseball . but then they had to screw it up . they traded their birthright for a mess of porridge . a mess of porridge .
jesus , tommy , it ai n't science , you know . you got your good trades and your bad trades . that 's how it works .
okay , joke about it . i do n't give a shit .
management . those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses .
yeah ? and why is that ?
i 'll tell you why they 're not going anywhere .
twelve-eleven . twelve-twelve . twelve-twelve .
so what 's the time ?
tick-tock , tick-tock .
you still have that watch auggie gave you ?
huh ?
hey , jimmy . you got the time ?
now ask him who his mother was .
like it or not , cyrus , that 's my name . cole . just like yours .
i was going to tell him ... but in my own time . in my own time ... .
if it does n't make any difference , why not just say it ?
it 's all right . i really do know them .
we came here to deliver some clean laundry .
research . i worked the scene right into my story . that makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible .
wow . they sure did a job on you .
hi , kid .
good . i 'm glad that 's settled !
fuck you , too , you white son-of-a-bitch .
do n't worry about it . you 've got friends now , remember ? just behave yourself , and everything will work out .
i pay auggie , and i 've got nothing . eight hundred bucks and a ticket to shit city .
you 'll do it , all right . you fuck up , you 've got to undo the damage . that 's how it works , buster . if you do n't do it , i 'm going to throw you out of here . do you understand me ? if you do n't pay auggie what you owe him . i 'm finished with you .
i 'm not going to do it .
i 'm serious , all right . you 've got to square it with auggie . since you wo n't give the money back to the creeper , you can use it to make things right with auggie . that 's probably better anyway . better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies .
what are you talking about ? you ca n't be serious .
here 's what you 're going to do . you 're going to open up your backpack , take out your bag of money , count out five thousand dollars , and hand it over to auggie .
he was out five thousand bucks , he said ... . he kept saying it over and over ... . five thousand bucks down the drain ... . he would n't stop ... . five thousand bucks , five thousand bucks ... . he was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks ... .
no wonder he was angry .
i suppose so . he never told me about it .
cuban cigars . you mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys ?
the water was dripping , see ... i turned it off , but it was still dripping , and then auggie had to go out , and so i left the back room ... and later on ... well , later on ... when auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded . his cuban cigars got all messed up ... you know , soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits ... .
if you do n't tell me what happened , how do you expect me to know that ? i need facts , not opinions .
it was n't my fault .
well ?
it was more complicated than that . there was a reason .
so you lost the job . is that what you 're telling me ? he just up and fired you ?
keep up with that attitude , and you wo n't have a future . seventeen is a hell of an age to die . is that what you want ?
that money is my whole future .
a lot of good it will do you if the creeper finds you .
no way . there 's no way i 'm giving that money back . it 's my money now .
yeah , well , you have to be nuts to do what you did . if you want my opinion , you should give this money back to the creeper . just give it back and tell him you 're sorry .
that 's it . in a nutshell .
so you robbed the robbers , and now the robbers are after you .
six thousand dollars . five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars , to be exact .
you have one hell of a knack for getting into trouble , do n't you ? so how much does it come to ?
that 's just it . i did n't think . i just did it .
good thinking .
and started to run .
and started to run .
yeah , i picked it up .
christ . you did n't just see what happened . they dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up .
not exactly . i mean , there was more to it than i told you .
so you 're saying it was n't like that at all .
here , catch .
yeah , it might be .
is it yours ?
i do n't know .
you do n't believe me , huh ? look , i 'll show you . it 's all in this book .
nice try . you had me going for a second , but no ... no writer would ever do a thing like that . would he ?
his only copy . i mean , if you think you 're going to die , what 's more important , a good book or a good smoke ? and so he huffed and he puffed , and little by little he smoked his book .
his only copy ?
it 's 1942 , right ? and he 's caught in leningrad during the siege . i 'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history . five hundred thousand people died in that one place , and there 's bakhtin , holed up in an apartment , expecting to be killed any day . he has plenty of tobacco , but no paper to roll it in . so he takes the pages of a manuscript he 's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes .
absolutely . we would be honored .
yes , an invitation . i apologize for springing it on you at the last minute , but mr. benjamin and i are attending a celebration tonight , and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us . is n't that right , mr. benjamin ?
excuse me for asking , but you are n't married , are you ?
uh , actually , i tend to shy away from that kind of thing .
pick two or three . now that the coffers are open , you might as well take advantage of me .
here we are . rembrandt 's drawings . edward hopper . van gogh 's letters .
i mean earlier . we could have planned something .
i just did .
hey , hey . happy birthday . why did n't you tell me ?
it 's my birthday . i 'm seventeen years old as of forty-seven minutes ago , and i think i should celebrate having made it this far .
celebrate ? what for ?
no , not the end . the beginning . his son was just a little boy at the time , but the years passed , and when he grew up , he became a skier , too . one day last winter , he went out by himself for a run down the mountain . he gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock . just as he 's unwrapping his cheese sandwich , he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet . he bends down to take a closer look , and suddenly he feels that he 's looking into a mirror , that he 's looking at himself . there he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact , sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation . he gets down on all fours , looks right into the dead man 's face , and realizes that he 's looking at his father .
the end .
all right . listen carefully . about twenty-five years ago , a young man went skiing alone in the alps . there was an avalanche , the snow swallowed him up , and his body was never recovered .
no way .
yeah , right . the inspiration . it 's a true story anyway , so i do n't suppose it can hurt , can it ?
the inspiration .
okay , just a little hint . i ca n't tell you the story , but i 'll tell you what gave me the idea for it .
come on , just a little hint .
if i tell you , i might not be able to finish it .
that 's logical . and if you do n't sleep , you do n't need a bed . saves you money , too . so what 's this story you 're working on , anyway ?
if you do n't sleep , you do n't dream . if you do n't dream , you do n't have nightmares .
just so you do n't overdo it . you do n't want to die of sleep deprivation before you finish .
once a story gets hold of you , it 's hard to let go . besides , i 'm making up for lost time .
you work too hard , you know that ?
i do n't know . two or three . it was pretty late .
what time did you get to bed last night ?
thanks .
one sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open .
ah , coffee . smells good .
fair enough . we would n't want to get carried away , would we ? now call your aunt em and let her know you 're alive .
let 's not get too idealistic .
maybe . or maybe it 's the other people who do n't belong .
that 's because we do n't belong anywhere . you do n't fit into your world , and i do n't fit into mine . we 're the outcasts of the universe .
it looks like they 've met in this apartment .
it might not be far , but it 's another galaxy . black is black and white is white , and never the twain shall meet .
what makes you think you 'll be any safer around here ? it 's only about a mile away from where you live .
the man has friends . and they 're not likely to forgive me if i testify against him .
if they put this creeper in jail , then you 'd be safe .
you 're joking , right ? i mean , that 's your way of trying to be funny , right ?
why do n't you go to the police ?
i just happened to be walking by ... all of a sudden , the creeper and this other guy come running out of this check-cashing place with masks on their faces and guns in their hands ... they just about ran smack into me . the creeper recognized me , and i knew he knew i recognized him ... if the guy from the check-cashing place had n't rushed out then screaming bloody murder , he would have shot me . i 'm telling you , the creeper would have shot me right there on the sidewalk . but the noise distracted him , and when he turned around to see what was happening , i took off ... one more second , and i would have been dead .
so that 's the something you were n't supposed to see , huh ?
i crossed paths with him . that 's why i 'm trying to stay clear of my neighborhood . to make sure i do n't run into him again .
and ?
okay , okay . it 's all so stupid . there 's this guy , see . charles clemm . the creeper , that 's what people call him . the kind of guy you do n't want to cross paths with .
i do n't , huh ? and what makes you such an authority on what i want or do n't want ?
you do n't really want to know .
close the door . sit down in that chair . now listen carefully . your aunt em came here a couple of days ago . she was sick with worry , out of her mind . we had an interesting talk about you , thomas . do you understand what i 'm saying ? your aunt thinks you 're in trouble and so do i. tell me about it , kid . i want to hear all about it right now .
i do n't have much time .
cut it out , will you ? just cut it out and come back here .
business appointment . i 'm seeing my broker at three o'clock .
where the hell do you think you 're going ?
i bought it . twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at goldbaum 's tv and radio . well , that just about takes care of it , i guess . you 'll be able to watch the ball games . you know , as a little break from your work .
where did you get that thing ?
i do n't know . for helping me out .
appreciation for what ?
i wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation .
hey , it 's you .
you too . and make sure the light is green before you cross the street . oh , by the way , i liked your book . i think you 're a hell of a good writer .
take good care of yourself , okay ?
not a penny , not a stitch . i 'm cool , man .
do you need some money ? some extra clothes ?
absolutely . the world is my oyster . whatever that means .
are you going to be all right ?
you do n't have to apologize . the coast is probably clear now anyway .
no hard feelings , okay ? it 's a small place , and i ca n't get my work done with you around .
i 'm sorry i messed up . you 've been very kind to me ... but all good things have to come to an end , right ?
it sounds like our time is up , does n't it ?
two or three nights .
and how long did i tell you you could stay ?
three nights .
how long have you been here ?
i did n't ask to come here . you invited me , remember ? if you want me to leave , all you have to do is say so .
it just wo n't do , will it ? i go two and a half years without being able to write a word , and then , when i finally get started on something , when it looks as though i might actually be coming to life again , you show up and start breaking everything in my house . it just wo n't do , will it ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm really sorry ... i was trying to reach for one of the books up there ... and then , i do n't know , the sky fell on top of me .
if you want to steal it , that 's your business . at least i wo n't have you around here making noise . it might be worth it .
twenty dollars is a lot of money . are you sure you can trust me with it ? i mean , are n't you afraid i might steal it ?
the world is going to end pretty soon if you do n't learn fast . look , why not make yourself useful ? i 'm just about out of smokes . go around the corner to the brooklyn cigar company and buy me two tins of schimmelpenninck medias .
i 'm a teenager . all teenagers are clumsy . it 's because we 're still growing . we do n't know where our bodies end and the world begins .
a little less clumsiness around here would be nice , do n't you think ?
i 'm sorry . they just ... they just slipped out of my hands .
jesus , do you make a lot of noise . ca n't you see i 'm trying to work ?
you 'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator . cereal in the cupboard . coffee on the stove . take whatever you want . but it 's time for me to get started in here .
eight-thirty ?
eight-thirty .
what time is it ?
time to wake up . hey , kid , time to wake up . rashid ! up and out . i have to work in here . the slumber party is over .
yeah , sometimes . i like to dabble , too .
is that what you do ? draw pictures ?
drawing 's a good thing .
twelve , thirteen years ago . actually , he died with his sketch pad open on his lap . up in the berkshires one weekend , drawing a picture of mount greylock .
he 's dead ?
no , he was a schoolteacher . but he liked to dabble .
is your father an artist ?
it 's strange , though , is n't it ? looking at yourself before you knew who you were .
yeah , i can believe it .
my father did . believe it or not , that little baby is me .
nice drawing . did you do that ?
i listen on the radio . i can see the games just fine that way . the world is in your head , remember ?
but then you do n't get to watch the ball games . you told me you were a mets fan .
i used to have one , but it broke a couple of years ago and i never got around to replacing it . i 'd just as soon not have one anyway . i hate those damn things .
this is the first house i 've been in without a tv .
that 's it . just the two rooms .
same here . but i had a long talk with my accountant this afternoon . you know , to see how a move like this would affect my tax picture , and he said it would be okay .
i did n't expect to see you again .
suit yourself . but if you change your mind , here 's the address .
i can take care of myself . do n't worry .
in case you 're wondering , i like women , not little boys . and i 'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights .
thanks , but i 'll manage .
i 'm not `` people . '' i 'm just me . and i do whatever i goddamn want to do . got it ?
people do n't do that kind of thing . not in new york .
but your body is in the world , is n't it ? if someone offered you a place to stay , you would n't necessarily refuse , would you ?
the material world is an illusion . it does n't matter if they 're there or not . the world is in my head .
except that there 's no bed , is there ? and no breakfast either .
yeah , that 's right .
uh-huh . one of those cozy bed and breakfast places , probably .
here and there . around .
you ca n't be more specific than that ?
the what . i 've kind of run away from home , you see . it has nothing to do with my parents or money . i saw something i was n't supposed to see , and for the time being it 's best that i keep myself out of sight .
the what ?
that 's where the what comes in .
then what are you doing in park slope ? it 's a little far from home , is n't it ?
of course . where else ?
in manhattan ?
east seventy-fourth street .
and where do momsie and popsie live ?
oh no . momsie and popsie have oodles .
that 's true . but i also owe you something , and i 'm not sure that buying you a hamburger is going to do the job . what is it ? family problems ? money problems ?
you do n't know me from a hole in the wall .
you do n't have to tell me if you do n't want to , but i might be able to help .
mostly what .
cocktail hour is over . the young man would like to order a hamburger .
well , maybe just one . to be polite .
look , kid , it 's okay with me . you do n't have to play games . if you want a hamburger or something , go ahead and order it .
just one bottle . i believe in moderation .
yeah , sure , and i bet you had lobster last night . along with two bottles of champagne .
i mean breakfast .
you must eat lunch pretty early . it 's only eleven o'clock .
that 's okay . i 've already had lunch .
are you sure you do n't want some food to go along with it ? it might help to absorb some of that liquid . you do n't want to slosh around too much when you stand up .
rashid . rashid cole .
good . lemonade it is . i 'm paul .
i do n't drink coffee . on the other hand , since you insist , if you offered me a cold lemonade . i would n't say no .
come on . at least let me buy you a cup of coffee .
that 's all right . if i think of something , i 'll send my butler over to tell you .
you have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance .
well , if you put it that way ...
yes it is . it 's a law of the universe . if i let you walk away , the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years .
it 's okay , mister . no big deal .
i owe you something .
i just happened to be there . the right place at the right time .
no , wait . you ca n't just walk off . you saved my life .
no harm done . everything 's okay now . i 've got to be going .
i ca n't believe i did that ... christ . i 'm walking around in a fog ...
watch out , man . you 'll get yourself killed like that .
i do n't mean to pry , but i see a kid walking around with a big knapsack on his back , and i begin to wonder if all his worldly possessions are n't stowed in there . are you in some kind of trouble or what ?
if you 're lucky . then again , it depends on what you call living .
i 'll take the iced coffee . you only live once , right ?
everything is real in here , honey . as real as the color of my hair .
do you have real iced coffee , or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes ?
hot coffee or iced coffee ?
yeah , give him another one . and i 'll take a cup of coffee while you 're at it .
you want another one of these , too ?
yes , please .
lettuce and tomato ?
yes , please .
fries ?
medium rare , please .
how do you want that cooked ?
did n't say i was buyin ' did i ? what you want down ? just bein ' curious , is all .
$ 1200 an acre , that 's what i paid ole , wo n't take a dime less . you got no choice on that .
hid it from my mom . caught a mess a sea runs . damn thing 's still in my closet .
oh , yeh ?
i am a bastard . i 'm a big hun nazi son of a bitch . and i still got your bamboo fishing rod .
... < u > might < /u > do the same . i have to warn you 'bout that , chief . i 'm not screwed together like i used to be .
the battery 's in , that 's done with . besides , you 'd do the same for m ...
what are you sellin ' 'em for ? why do n't we start there .
seven acres . i 'm wonderin ' what you 'd pay for 'em . just curious , is all .
keep it tonight . we 'll catch fish . i 'll see ya back on the docks ...
do n't know how long it 's take to get a charge ...
... or from the cut on his hand . which is more probable ?
i 'm a hemotologist , not a detective .
with no bone or scalp or hair present . would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man 's skull ...
you do n't .
i do n't know .
i 'm a hemotologist , sir , i was asked only t ...
well , if the blood got < u > onto < /u > the gaff by crushing a man 's skull ...
none .
no bits of bone , no particles of scalp , no strands of hair ?
bits of blood and wood . what else would there be ?
you scraped the dried blood from the < u > butt < /u > of the gaff . where a fella 's < u > hand < /u > goes . and what did you see under your microscope , besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings ... ?
that 's obvious .
and the blood could < u > not < /u > have belonged to defendant . seeing that his type is o negative .
no , but as i say , the type is rare . ten percent of caucasian males .
but you ca n't say with any certainty that the blood was his .
carl heine 's type .
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all . it was < u > human < /u > , yes ? type b positive .
did he see some < u > danger < /u > from defen ...
that he 'd keep an eye on miyamoto . watch out for him .
when your son came back from the war , what did he say about all this ?
well . every time i see him in town or somewhere , he 's starin ' at me with these narrow eyes . givin ' me his mean face .
what do you mean by 'dirty looks ' ?
just showed up at my door , big as life and twice as mean . wanted to talk to my son .
and when he came home . did he write you about this ? or phone , perhaps .
in the war . europe , i believe . they could hardly send him to the pacific , could they ?
now defendant 's father had also died by that point . where was the defendant ? when you sent his family their equity .
their kids was born here . so when the oldest , that one there , was twenty ... last payment gets made , and he could own it .
why ? if they could never take title .
carl held it < u > for < /u > 'em . called it a lease . they make payments every june and december ...
but back in '34 , japanese-born could not < u > own < /u > land . so ... ?
they fished t'gether . went to school . carl junior treated him like a white person . like any friend .
so the defendant knew the deceased , your son , even then .
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land . lived in a picker 's cabin at first .
you done your math right .
it is .
is that your third question ?
so that makes what would have been $ 4500 into $ 7000 , does n't it ? if you sent the equity back , you had a profit of $ 2500 .
a thousand .
second question . what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre ?
tried to . defaulted on their payments .
just three questions . the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $ 4500 ?
well , it does seem mighty warm in here . specially for mr. hooks .
thank you , mr. gillanders . thank you for coming down , in this cold weather .
now , how is miyamoto gon na know in < u > advance < /u > ? that carl loses two batteries . must happen once ever ' 20 years or so .
well , what if ?
you mean miyamoto followed him out there , and sucker-punched him ?
all right , what if the defendant < u > heard < /u > ? so carl < u > let < /u > him aboard , to help . and < u > then < /u > the fishing gaff ?
compressed air horn , most likely . hope to god some man hears you in that fog .
course , if carl lost both batteries , dead in the water , his radio would n't work . so how would he signal for help ?
boat has two batteries . lose one you run off the other til morning . carl musta lost both , so miyamoto there gave him one a his .
no sense to have < u > any < /u > at all. , even the right size . it 's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car . nobody does .
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl 's well was carl 's own spare . even though it was too large f ...
could n't get on the boat . i 'd just < u > shoot < /u > the feller . < u > then < /u > tie up , throw him inta th ' drink . and skip bein ' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding .
so the fishing gaff method would n't make sense ?
i 'm sorry about that . it was n't mine in the first place .
it 's a joke . maneuver up to carl 's boat ? tie your lines fast ? come aboard ? all against carl 's will ? it 's the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of .
now if you wanted to kill a man . think you 'd try boarding against his will , and hitting him with a fishing gaff ?
unwritten rule of the sea . we do n't bother each other , stick to ourselves . ask anybody .
now , mister gi ...
i said . no further questions .
you 're implying th ...
question withdrawn , you may step down .
it seems human . to me .
does n't it seem to < u > you < /u > , mrs. miyamoto , that your mistake was in being deceitful ? concealing information during the course of a sheriff 's investigation .
well , it seems to me ...
we were afraid . silence seemed better . to come forward seemed like a mistake .
so you hid the truth . deliberately .
trials are n't only about truth , mr. hooks . even though they should be . they 're about what people < u > believe < /u > is true .
but if truth was on your side , whatever were you worried about ?
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder .
why not ?
we discussed that . and decided not to .
up in the air ? was < u > that < /u > your reaction ?
yes , and then , what was there to call about ? everything was up in the air .
and then , something did . carl heine was found dead . with his head crushed .
of course not . we 're just not quick to run and boast . in case something went wrong .
you thought the deceased might ... break his promise ?
so , five hours . plenty of time for a call . he was 'excited ' , you say . in the sense of being 'overjoyed ' .
closer to eight .
your husband returned at , what , seven o'clock ?
we hear how carl ... passed away . only a few hours later .
so , then , you ... and your husband ... must have called friends , relatives , to tell them the amazing news . yes ?
happy for him . and relieved .
you were ... overjoyed yourself , to hear the news ?
i said 'excited ' . not agitated , he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed .
it 's not for the . they only get to convict him .
i did . but the jury wo n't s ...
did you write that column ?
look , i < u > want < /u > to forget you , i do . i think if you hold me , just this once , i can walk away and never speak to you again .
you have to hear this , i can never touch you , ishmael . not once , not ever . there 's no half- way . as much as i know it hurts you , you have to let this go .
there 's no one here , and i 've < u > got < /u > to talk to you .
i 'm married , ishmael . it is n't right for us to be alone . people will t ...
the japs did it .
i 'm sorry about your arm . kabuo and i. are very sor ...
i could n't say anything . i just stood there , hating her .
i do n't mean everyone . just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them . or run a newspaper .
we all expect the world to be fair . as if we have some right t ...
look at my face . it 's the face of the people who did that . my father hardly speaks english . we 're in bad trouble , you have to see that .
it 's just pearl harbor . people are a little crazy , right n ...
it 'll be over soon . i can get you money .
my father ca n't get our money from the bank . we have a few dol ...
i lie to my parents every day . and every night .
there ca n't be any wrong in this , ha ...
well , i do n't do it for just anybody .
i can just feel my spirits soar .
why ? we 're only talking .
my mom . would be the problem .
we 're japanese , not mexican , ishmael . he 'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword .
your friends would . your dad would kill me with a machete .
the best part was that there was a 'this ' . to debate the wrongness of .
easy . slow is best .
i told myself that was good . that it made our friendship special . and did n't mean she was ashamed of it . necessarily .
at school , she kept mostly to the japanese kids , and sort of ignored me . as if all of our times alone together ... in the hollow cedar , everywhere ... were a secret .
he 's still got a good grip . we need to dig more .
... but he found you .
your father fought at belleau wood , it took him years to get over it . nightmares , tears , b ...
those are n't the facts that matter .
they 're not his neighbor , like you are . he is a husband , a father , he risked his < u > life < /u > for < u > their < /u > country . the same as you .
seattle boys think he 's guilty . they say the evidence is rock solid .
they only arrested that poor soul because he 's japanese .
you 've been busy with that trial , i suppose . such a travesty ...
i felt milholland 's report in my pocket . and wondered why i was n't telling her . telling someone . what i 'd found .
agnostics do n't believe or disbelieve , ma . we just do n't pretend we know .
you do n't believe in god anymore .
oh , in a heartbeat .
and your evaluation of the defendant ? could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff ? so quickly , there would be no sign of struggle ?
what else ? i had the boy teach me kendo . including ... the importance of the bow .
well , what then , sergeant ?
more than eager . he was out to make a point .
so . wide cross-section of men to evaluate . and the day that the defendant volunteered for this ... demonstration . did you find him eager ?
it was my specialty , sir , i trained several thousand over the years .
and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat .
they were japanese-american boys , yes sir .
pretty darn clear .
and replaced it later with the new one . that 's your inference ?
you bet . and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off , he coulda left this line behind on carl 's boat .
so if defendant had tied up to deceased 's boat . with that last one . would those cleats have lined up ?
found on carl 's boat , too . starboard side , second cleat from the stern . but it does n't match carl 's lines . it matches miyamoto 's . perfect .
and the last ... ?
from carl heine 's boat . all his were like this one , three-strand manila , new condition , braided in loops . not bowlined like miyamoto 's .
and the next one ... ?
... comes off third cleat from the stern , port side . and it 's brand new . unlike the rest .
these are fishermen , alvin . they do n't talk at all to each other and less to me . specially gossip .
so , no ... immediate suspicion , no ... general talk of enmity between the two .
nossir . i 'd gone to tell the wid ... to tell mrs. heine .
and you were n't there , when the coroner examined the wound .
japanese stick-fighting . they 're trained as kids , y'know . to kill with sticks .
could you tell me what 'kendo ' is ?
well , i was a doctor in the jap theater , in the war . i saw those kendo wounds , < u > many < /u > times . looked exactly like this one .
and why . is that ?
i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes ... i 'd maybe look for a ... japanese person . with a bloody gun- butt . a right-handed fella , to be precise .
did you say more ?
he said , 'could it be somebody hit him ? ' and i said , 'you want to play sherlock holmes , here ? '
... so when the sheriff returned , you showed him the injury to the deceased 's head .
tht was summation , your h ...
your honor , < u > all < /u > of this is speculation . including mr. hooks ' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call .
objection !
you 're a hard man to trust , sir . you sit before us , with no expression , keeping a poker f ...
all right . what did your son < u > say < /u > to that effect ?
objection . asking witness to speculate about deceased 's state of mind .
my gosh , alvin , was i supposed to object every time you did that ?
objection , asking the witness to speculate .
as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man , and an assailant strong enough to subdue him ... that leaves only a < u > single < /u > overturned < u > cup < /u > in its wake ?
no , sir , i ca n't . not beyond a reasonable doubt .
< u > were < /u > you , sir ? can you < u > prove < /u > one word of all your fancy story ?
that 's curious . i was < u > appealing < /u > to their intelligence .
and i would n't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful . at a tactic that insults their intelligence .
that 's how journalists . answer questions .
i asked you a question , you 're writing a tract , h ...
he did n't want to lose any more .
greedy .
like you could n't believe .
your line of work . you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth .
oh , yes .
but is n't the < u > truth < /u > that there are < u > several < /u > other ways to explain < u > each < /u > of these twelve pieces .
then putting them together . so truth is revealed .
my expertise . is that i 'm a journalist .
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork . what is your expertise , sir , are you a detective of sorts ?
twelve .
well , the freighter . the twine . the blood . the knife . the cup . the watch . the second battery . the phantom lantern . the fishing gaff . the cracked gunnel . the skull wound . the blond hair . that 's < u > eleven < /u > things ...
i 'm sorry , was there a question in there ?
< u > everything < /u > had to happen < u > just < /u > right . for your little story to fly . i mean , a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a < u > lot < /u > of reasons .
objection ! speculation .
maybe it went . where carl went . over the side .
he said he did n't want that life no more . he 'd been saving to buy a farm . he was sorry i got sick . but pretty excited to get back his father 's place .
but carl was a fisherman . and successful at it .
carl heine came .
and then your stroke came this summer . and you put your property on the market , i believe you said september 7. which , remember , is < u > eight < /u > days before carl heine died . and who comes spetember 7 , wanting to buy ?
oh , yeh . but this is nine year ago , i had my healt , i was n't wantin ' to sell .
mr. jurgensen . did he offer to < u > buy < /u > the seven acres from you ?
oh , yeh . he said someday he would get his land back .
robbed . he was angry .
i had a spare battery in my shed . i brought it down , and put it in just before the sheriff showed up .
well , the sheriff found < u > two < /u > batteries in your well . if you left one with carl heine , how is that possible ?
yes .
did n't go anywhere else ? no errands , no purchases ? just straight to the boat . that 's the truth .
i slept til one-thirty , when my wife woke me up with the news . we talked for a few hours . i left at six and went straight to my boat .
i see . now what happened the day carl heine was found ? before your arrest .
you mean , this morning . the new story , the battery story . that one is the truth ? that 's a question , sir .
i have told the truth .
my apologies . do you regret not telling the truth ?
should have told 'everything ' . meaning , you should have told the < u > truth < /u > .
i should have told everything right away . i know that now , and i regret it .
well , 'initially ' is an interesting word , sir . you 'd < u > been < /u > arrested , you < u > had < /u > a lawyer , and you < u > still < /u > claimed ignorance !
yes . initially .
but even < u > after < /u > you had an attorney . you still claimed to know < u > nothing < /u > . claimed < u > not < /u > to have seen carl . am i correct ?
sheriff said right off , i was under suspicion . i did n't have a lawyer ...
actually , she said you had decided . decided < u > not < /u > not come forward .
as my wife testified , we were considering it .
some seaman 's loast report . stuffed in a cabinet , good as lost forever . no one knows .
they got transferred that day . out to cape flattery .
no , night of the 16th , morning the 17th . we replaced two guys named miller and milholland .
you mean , early morning the 16th ?
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16 .
how long you have this detail ?
shorthard the radio transmis- sions , write 'em up , file 'em in a cabinet . nobody ever looks . just take up space .
and you keep the records , or contribute to 'em .
since september . last guys got transferred .
you have the night watch ? on the radio .
do n't prove there was two lanterns . coulda been the one in the cabin .
it 's on the twine , too . but it 's not r ...
you 're right . i better use two .
you gon na climb that with one arm ?
have a look . at nothing .
here now , what are you fixin ' to do ?
it 's public record . if the public cares enough to read it .
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place .
wo n't take two .
you said three minutes .
three kids . what 's she going to do ?
i did . boy .
it 's a rare thing . takes a turning point .
we do n't let go , you s ...
naw , i 've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes .
you ever been strangled by a single hand ?
if i whistle . those boys 'll see you , and come runnin ' . < u > you 're < /u > the story today .
i 'll take two . one for later .
cigarette ?
well , anything coulda caused that .
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely . we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel . just below the mast .
you think so ?
he hit his head . on the way in .
still and all . carl was a strong swimmer , he m ...
the freighter started through at 1:42. the sea water seeped into carl 's watch and stopped it . at 1:47 .
still a coincidence . timing and all .
the knife . what knife ?
then where 's the lantern ? and where 's the knife ?
but you < u > could < /u > be wrong . he < u > could < /u > have climbed up earlier .
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio , which is now working . same report milholland heard . and < u > that < /u > makes him get the lantern fast . before the freighter 's wake can bang it around .
maybe ... ?
coincidences happen . you run a yellow light < u > just < /u > as a car comes out of nowhere . split-second tragedy happens every day . or maybe ...
just as the freighter comes through ? is n't that quite a coincidence ?
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there . so he climbs up . to cut it down .
still lashed to the mast .
miyamoto gave him the battery , and left . carl 's boat was running , he goes back to fishing . but at some point , he thinks of the lantern ...
fell .
that 's when he fell .
because the second lantern , the one on the mast . was never found . so we have to ask ...
well , why does it ?
that 's what mr. miyamoto reported , and he 'd have no reason to lie . he could n't know that it would help his case .
now you believe there were < u > two < /u > lanterns when defendant arrived . one in carl 's hand . the second lashed to the mast .
well . it shows the prosecutor was wrong . it was < u > carl 's < /u > boat that was dead in the water . or he 'd never have put up the lantern .
tell us why that lantern would be so significant .
to my father . everything counts .
he 's looking down . and he 's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday . he 's proud of the man you are tonight . that 's what counts .
yes , he was .
your daddy . was quite a feller .
i 'm wondering how the judge is gon na like my waking up his old bones . in the middle of the night .
you 're wondering why i held it .
this tastes horrible , hmmn ?
no , you do n't .
it 's the way it happened , i know it is .
look , no way i 'm lettin ' you out there . in a half hour you could be in canada .
sheriff , i ca n't afford not to fish toni ...
sure . blood gets all < u > over < /u > your hand , sheriff , ask any fisherman .
you gaff with the < u > hook < /u > end . blood 's on the butt . where your hand goes .
sure you did . help me with this hold cover , willya ?
naw , i had that around for a while .
see you replaced a mooring line , lately . this one 's new .
i was checking the cables .
you always run with the well open ?
we have a warrant . to search your boat .
what for , sheriff ?
and what do you believe ?
i told your wife . trials are n't always so much about actual truth . as about what folks < u > believe < /u > is true . that 's sad . and it 's real .
you think that < u > is < /u > the truth .
i want you . to tell the truth .
you want me to say that .
you wo n't hear that from hooks . because the charge is < u > first < /u > -degree murder , which requires premeditation . he ca n't change the charge .
i 'm more a hot-blooded killer , huh ? like a soldier . like a samurai .
that you came upon carl by accident . like you said . gave him the battery . like you said . asked him about the seven acres . like you said .
and what 's that ?
i should show them an american ?
so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .
mr. gudmundsson , we < u > know < /u > what that jury is looking at .
now this jury is gon na be lookin ' at the evidence with one eye . and at you with the oth ...
you 're wonderin ' ... how come i never ask . if you did it .
you would n't even see it move .
sure . i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open . right above your left ear .
bet there 's a few things you could teach me . kendo , for one .
i think you like learning .
you must think i like losing .
you mean , do i like to take the offensive ? or hang back and wait .
white or black ?
your daddy played . i asked , down at the japanese community center . you smoke cigars ?
what makes you think i play ?
< u > you < /u > said that . that was < u > your < /u > testimony .
even though a d-6 is too big , and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in . which makes it a peculiar choice . for a spare .
what else could it be ?
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6 , which must have been a spare .
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well . and a dead d-8 on the deck .
the damage was considerable . but she 's insured . thanks , again .
and her farmhouse ... ?
she 's alright , nels , thanks for asking .
how < u > is < /u > your mother-in-law ?
possible . but not darn likely .
operating this winch you 'd rarely operated before , doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds ... is it < u > possible < /u > . possible that he struck his head < u > after < /u > death . possible ?
you do n't . < u > remember < /u > .
he was heavy , but we were real careful . but i do n't remember him hitting anything , anywhere .
you do n't . < u > think < /u > so .
i do n't think so .
is it possible his head struck the transom , or the stern gunnel , or the net roller , as you were bringing him in ?
now you 've testified that the deceased was a heavy man , and hard to bring out of the net .
i believe so .
i 'm curious . the d-6 that was refitted into the deceased 's well . was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant 's ?
apparently .
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with < u > no < /u > spare battery , hmmn ?
no .
no spare .
two d-6 's . that 's the kind his well was fitted for .
sheriff , how many batteries and what size did you find on < u > defendant 's < /u > boat ?
it was dead . we had it tested . maybe the d-6 was the spare and he had to use it .
but he had a spare d-6 , you said . right there . why not use that ?
he 's done some on-the-spot refit- ting . you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6 .
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery . a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8 . it would be too large for the deceased 's well .
it is .
you found three batteries , you say . a d-6 and d-8 in the well . and a spare d-8 on the cabin floor . correct ?
you have to wonder .
a little . yes . you have to wonder .
does it now ?
did n't think about it at the time . so no , it did n't strike me odd .
and yet you started the engine right up . with all those lights drawing all night , the batteries had that much charge . did that strike you odd ?
yessir , there 'd been real heavy fog .
i think you testified < u > all < /u > the lights were on . cabin , mast , net lights , picking lights ...
maybe .
right . in the middle . of the floor .
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin . and forgot the cup .
< u > yes < /u > , i 'm sure .
are you absol ...
absolutely not . probably one or two hours . four at the most .
yes , you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased 's right hand . the report says 'recent origin ' . how recent ? as much as 24 hours before death ?
can i say something , here ?
for the third time , yes .
but you are < u > certain < /u > that he died by drowning .
for certain , no .
< u > and < /u > that you ca n't say for < u > certain < /u > whether the head injury was sustained before or < u > after < /u > death ?
i already said that , b ...
is it fair to say that you do not know for < u > certain < /u > which it was .
sure , anything 's poss ...
is it possible ?
if the head was moving fast enough , but i do n't see how it could be .
so if his head struck something narrow and flat , the gunnel of a boat , a net roller , a fairlead , could that have ...
the same .
can you tell whether an object moved against the head , or the other way around ? or would both look the same .
obviously .
in your motorcycle example . those injuries are produced by the head being propelled < u > against < /u > an object . rather than the reverse , yes ?
your report says death by < u > drowning < /u > , which means he went into the water alive and breathing . and the report is accurate ... ?
well ...
meaning that he was n't murdered first , say on the deck of the boat , and then thrown overboard .
that 's < u > why < /u > the autopsy report identifies < u > drowning < /u > as the cause of death .
as i testified . it occurs when water , mucus and air are mixed by respiration . i believe i said that .
so this ... foam you found in the lungs . how does it get there ?
that 's all he said .
the question is more about the < u > defendant 's < /u > attitu ...
carl said he did n't like kabuo much anymore .
sorry about that , mrs. heine . shall i repeat the ques ...
you can speak for what he < u > said < /u > . just like you did for mr. hooks ...
i ca n't speak for him .
carl ever say < u > he < /u > got one ?
he had no reason to .
those 'dirty looks ' . defendant ever aim one of those at you ?
of course not . but it was emotional . a friend 's plea set against his mother 's attitude .
carl never lied .
i guess you 'd have to guess . not having been there with them . having to guess whether your husband 's report was word for word accurate .
so the defendant was encouraged to hope . or could have been .
not in those words .
well , he did n't say 'no ' , did he ? did n't say no hope existed .
i would n't say encouraged .
so your husband said he 's think it over . encouraged mr. miyamoto to believe he might sell to h ...
whatever the latest jargon is . mekum much better , much higher . for example , where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality , these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination . it 's < u > all < /u > aggression . sloan < u > real < /u > men ! church at ease , lieutenant . what if they fought ? a sudden silence . sloan raises her eyebrows , gives rubrick a look . frowning thoughtfully , mekum looks up . mekum you mean up there ? church go ahead , rube . tell todd to take him . mekum no ! they all look at mekum . is this the chink in the armor ? the new soldiers ca n't fight ? church `` no '' ? mekum not fair . no contest . send two more of your old ones up . now church , rubrick , and sloan are stunned . they exchange a glance . mekum go ahead .
spirit ? oh ! you mean `` aq '' ... '' aggressive qualities '' ?
melton , on the double ! up a chain ! melton sir ! melton takes a few easy strides , gracefully catches a chain mid- stride , and smarts up , climbing easily and twice as fast as todd . church , sloan , and rubrick crane their necks as the two men struggle upward toward the rafters . three quarters of the way up , melton comes even with todd , then passes him . mekum , watching , smirks . church is watching too , and he 's still not satisfied . his brow is knit , something 's bothering him . angle high above , among the girders stonefaced , melton is resting an a `` platform '' on the chain , sixty feet up , beneath the girders , swaying gently . his stony gaze is on the next chain where todd is arriving at a `` platform '' on an adjacent chain ... only three feet away . their eyes meet , todd and melton alone together sixty feet up , three feet apart . neither man blinks , neither man flinches , neither man reveals anything at all ... low angle , looking up church considers the men high above , then to mekum . church what about ... spirit ?
maybe we could run some tests . kind of a comparison , the old and the new ...
such as ?
the sweep is just routine , not even police action . i 'd like to see some sort of ... meaningful evidence ...
that 's up to you field guys . h.q . wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in january .
well , the soldiers we 've got now , they 've been through all kinds of heavy shit ... and they 've always got the job done . now these new ones , these `` hot shots '' of yours ... what kind of action have they seen ? they < u > are < /u > battle-tested , are n't they ?
i ... see . i 'm not sure i quite get your ... point ...
... he used to say , `` if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . ''
mmmmmm . weeell , you know my old daddy was in maintenance and he had a saying ...
as i said , in every way . physically and psychologically . more endurance , quicker responses , better hand-eye , improved technical training . where the first psychology gave you ninety-eight percent obedience , this bunch gives you 99.4 .
improved ... how ?
never mind leaving your door open - i got a passkey .
beat it , buster .
it 's from satchel mouth at table seven . this is from me to you , doll .
bull fiddle .
which of you dolls is daphne ?
that 's the way i like 'em - big and sassy . and get rid of your roommate .
get lost , will you ?
wan na see my driver 's license ?
are n't you a little too young for that , sonny ?
because i 'm working the night shift - and i got a bottle of gin stashed away - and as soon as there 's a lull -
why ?
listen , doll - what time do you get off tonight ?
bye .
forget it , doll . after all , you work here - i work here - and believe you me , it 's nice to have you with the organization .
i suppose you want a tip ?
okay , doll .
yes . and that one , too .
are these your bags ?
i do n't know - but i can feel it right here . that 's one good thing about ulcers - it 's like a burglar alarm going off inside you .
funny ? in what way ?
you know , bienstock , there 's something funny about those two new girls .
all right , girls - from the top again .
i beg your pardon .
all right , girls . who does this belong to ? come on , now . speak up . sugar , i warned you !
i thought i made it clear i do n't want any drinking in this outfit .
yes , sue ? what is it ?
clarinet - drums - trumpet - trombone -
hi , mary lou - rosella - okay , dolores , get a move on - how 's your back , olga ?
me ? i 'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman .
those idiot broads ! here we are all packed to go to miami , and what happens ? the saxophone runs off with a bible salesman , and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant . i ought to fire you , bienstock .
my suitcase - with all my resort clothes .
a what ?
you girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials ?

pardon me , mr. bienstock - can i have my flask back ?
now cut that out , girls-none of that rough talk . they went to a conservatory .
no -- - how does it go ?
fresh !
upsy-daisy .
it 's entirely mutual .
you 're welcome .
thank you ever so .
you 're in berths 7 and 7a .
hey , she 's ticklish !
cut it out , girls . stop it . joe - josephine - help !
the one-legged jockey said - 'do n't worry about me , baby . i ride side-saddle . '
what did he say ?
- so the one-legged jockey said -
manhattans ? this time of night ?
okay .
it 's private . go away .
this a private clambake , or can anybody join ?
where were you guys ?
me and tiny , we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle .
what happened ?
they would n't be caught dead in chicago - so we 'll finish the job here . come on .
those two musicians from the garage !
same faces - same instruments - - and here 's your valentine 's card .
like i was telling you - little bonaparte is getting soft . he does n't have it here any more . used to be like a rock . too bad . i think it 's time for him to retire .
he even got charlie 's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated .
stop , or i 'll burst out crying .
say , boss - i been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that little bonaparte is real sore about what happened to toothpick charlie . him and charlie , they used to be choir boys together .
we 're not on the pier yet -
it 's all fixed ! osgood is meeting us on the pier -
there 's a convention , all right . there 's also the ladies ' morgue .
elope ? but there are laws - conventions -
tell him you 're going to elope with him .
what 'll i tell him ?
yeah , but they 're not watching yachts . come on - you 're going to call osgood .
did you hear that ?
first thing we got to do is get out of these clothes .
all right - so what do we do now ?
there you go with that we again .
we 'll walk . and if we have to , we 'll starve .
you crazy or something ? the place is crawling with mobsters - gangrene is setting in - and you 're making like diamond jim brady ! how are we going to get out of here ? how are we going to eat ?
no tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . it 's on the level this time .
what did we do ? joe , you 're not pulling one of your old tricks .
do n't worry . we did the right thing with it .
all right . what happened to our bracelet ?
what do you mean , your bracelet ? it 's our bracelet .
wait a minute - my bracelet . what happened to my bracelet ?
yeah - lets shove off .
i do n't know about the captain - but the navigator is getting his tail out of here .
i may throw up .
hello , my dearest darling . so good to hear your voice again .
hello , room 414 ? this is the ship-to-shore operator - i have a call for miss sugar cane .
drop her a postcard . any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
that 's when i was a saxophone player . now i 'm a millionaire .
since when ? usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth .
we ca n't just walk out on her without saying goodbye .
telephone call ? who 's got time for that ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
get me room 414 .
sugar ?
there 's our shaving stuff - and there 's sugar .
joe , if we get out of this hotel alive , you know what we 're going to do ? we 're going to sell the bracelet , and grab a boat to south america and hide out in one of those banana republics - the way i figure is , if we eat nothing but bananas , we can live there for fifty years - maybe a hundred years - that is , if we get out of the hotel alive . did we forget anything ?
but they 're from osgood . he wanted me to wear them tonight .
not that , you idiot .
okay , joe .
shut up and keep packing .
i tell you , joe , they 're on to us . they 're going to line us up against the wall and - eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames , and they 're going to take us to the ladies ' morgue , and when they undress us - i tell you , joe , i 'm just going to die of shame .
what ?
joe -
nag , nag , nag . look , we got a yacht , we got a bracelet , you got osgood , i 've got sugar - we 're really cooking .
what are you giving me with the omelette ?
so ? it 's going to break sugar 's heart when she finds out i 'm not a millionaire . that 's life . you ca n't make an omelette without breaking an egg .
it 's just going to break his heart when he finds out i ca n't marry him .
get it while you 're young . and you better fix your lips . you want to look nice for osgood , do n't you ?
i feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses .
daphne got a proposal tonight .
that 's some nerve !
wait a minute - lets not be hasty . after all , we do n't want to hurt poor osgood 's feelings .
naturally . you think my fiance is a bum ? now i guess i 'll have to give it back .
hey - these are real diamonds .
what engagement present ?
i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - i wish i were dead - i 'm a boy - i 'm a boy - what am i going to do about my engagement present ?
look , jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you 're a boy !
but joe - this may be my last chance to marry a millionaire !
jerry , listen to me - there are laws - conventions - it 's just not being done !
then we 'll get a quick annulment - he 'll make a nice settlement on me - i 'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
oh .
like right after the ceremony .
like when ?
oh , i do n't expect it to last . i 'll tell him the truth when the time comes .
you 're out of your mind ! how can you get away with this ?
we 've been discussing that . he wants to go to the riviera - but i sort of lean toward niagara falls .
like what are you going to do on your honeymoon ?
like what ?
jerry - there 's another problem .
his mother - we need her approval . but i 'm not worried - because i do n't smoke .
i 'll say there is !
look , stop treating me like a child . i 'm not stupid . i know there 's a problem .
jerry , you 'd better lie down . you 're not doing well .
security .
but you 're not a girl . you 're a guy ! and why would a guy want to marry a guy ?
why not ? he keeps marrying girls all the time !
jerry ! you ca n't be serious !
you think he 's too old for me ?
what are you talking about ? you ca n't marry osgood .
osgood proposed to me . we 're planning a june wedding .
what ?
i am .
congratulations . who 's the lucky girl ?
i 'm engaged .
what happened ?
have i got things to tell you !
hi , jerry . everything under control ?
i 'm just borrowing them . you 'll get them back tomorrow .
what are you doing with my flowers ?
oh , no . i 'm not getting caught in a miniature sand trap with that guy .
tell him you get seasick on a yacht . play miniature golf with him .
do n't give me the musketeers ! how 'm i going to keep the guy ashore ?
because we 're pals - buddies - the two musketeers .
why do i let you talk me into these things ? why ?
come on , you can do better than that . give him teeth - the whole personality .
remember - he 's your date for tonight . so smile .
you can both go take a flying jump .
daphne - your boy friend is waving at you .
oh , no ! not tonight , josephine !
that 's right .
with me ?
he 's going to be ashore with you .
and where 's he going to be ?
no . i 'm going to be on that boat with sugar .
you 're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man ?
of course , you 're not . i 'm going .
fat chance ! you call him right back and tell him i 'm not going .
just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and rudy vallee .
oh , he does !
you got it made , kid . fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht -
what message ? what motorboat ?
yes , mr. fielding - you 'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what 's that you said ? oh - zowie ! i 'll give her the message .
i 'm a push-over for whom ? what is it ? who 's on the phone ?
and what are you trying to do to poor sugar ? putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent - nobody talks like that ! i 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
wise guy , huh ? trying to louse me up -
daphne , you 're bothering us .
you know - the old shell game .
daphne - go on - tell me all about him .
he 's not only got a yacht , he 's got a bicycle .
yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate .
i heard a very sad story about a girl who went to bryn mawr . she squealed on her roommate , and they found her strangled with her own brassiere .
this happens to me all the time in public .
you - you -
what is it , young lady ? what are you staring at ?
do n't get burned , daphne .
yeah - let her soak . come on .
yeah ? well , i 'm your fairy godmother - and i 'm keeping an eye on you .
what are you talking about ? sugar and me , we 're just like sisters .
i watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other 's lipstick -
me ? after sugar ?
what are you giving me with the flying fish ? i know why you want to stick around - you 're after sugar .
what 's the beef ? we 're sitting pretty . we get room and board - we get paid every week - there 's the palm trees and the flying fish -
all right , all right ! but how long can we keep this up ?
so you got pinched in the elevator . so what ? would you rather be picking lead out of your navel ?
but this is so humiliating .
listen , stupid - right now spats colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country .
we can get a job with another band . a male band .
how can we ? we 're broke .
you promised - the minute we hit florida , we were going to beat it .
blow where ?
i 'm tired of being a flag . i want to be a bull again . lets get out of here , joe . let 's blow .
they do n't care - just as long as you wear skirts . it 's like waving a red flat in front of a bull .
and i 'm not even pretty .
well , now you know how the other half lives .
i got pinched in the elevator .
what happened ?
you would n't hit a girl , would you ?
male and female - the moth and the flame - i ought to slug you !
break it up , girls ! daphne ! come on , help me !
it 's not my fault . i did n't invite them .
what 's going on here ? daphne - daphne -
good night , josephine .
good night , daphne .
then pull the emergency brake !
but suppose i lose ? suppose it 's an emergency ?
fight it .
but suppose i got to go - like for a drink of water ?
i just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . there 'll be no buzzing around tonight .
what are you doing ?
i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl . i 'm a girl -
steady , boy . just keep telling yourself you 're a girl .
we would be caught dead with men . those rough , hairy beasts with eight hands - they all want just one thing from a girl .
oh , you do n't have to worry about that .
men ?
you tore it again !
look - no butter , no pastry , and no sugar !
boy , would i like to borrow a cup of that sugar .
forget it . one false move , and they 'll toss us off the train - there 'll be the police , and the papers , and the mob in chicago ...
how about the shape of that liquor cabinet ?
down , daphne !
bye , sugar . we been playing with the wrong bands .
polish ?
i changed it . it used to be sugar kowalczyk .
now you tore the other one .
this way , daphne .
you better come help me .
you 'd better go fix it .
tore off one of my chests .
done what ?
now you 've done it !
not there - that 's the emergency brake .
listen , stupe - no butter and no pastry . we 're on a diet !
when i was a kid , i used to have a dream - i was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
watch it , daphne !
how about that talent ? this is like falling into a tub of butter .
i 'm josephine . sax .
hello , everybody . i 'm the bass fiddle . just call me daphne .
i never did like the name geraldine .
daphne ?
and i 'm daphne .
my name is josephine .
this time i 'm not going to let you talk me into something that ...
what are you afraid of ? nobody 's asking you to have a baby . this is just to get out of town . the minute we hit florida , we 'll blow this set-up .
who are we kidding ? look at that - look how she moves - it 's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor . i tell you it 's a whole different sex .
the name is josephine . and it was your idea in the first place .
it 's no use . we 'll never get away with it , joe .
with those legs ? are you crazy ?
i feel so naked . like everybody 's looking at me .
quit stalling . we 'll miss the train .
and it 's so drafty . they must be catching colds all the time .
must be the way their weight is distributed . come on .
how can they walk on these things ? how do they keep their balance ?
shave our legs , stupid .
shave ? at a time like this ? those guys got machine guns - they 're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave ?
we are going out of town . but we 're going to shave .
we got to get out of town . maybe we ought to grow beards .
the police ? we 'd never live to testify . not against spats colombo . wabash 1098 .
you going to call the police ?
that 's not far enough . you do n't know those guys ! but they know us . every hood in chicago will be looking for us -
as far away as possible .
where are we running , joe ?
not yet . but if those guys catch us , there 'll be blood all over . type o .
you do n't see any blood ?
they got the bull-fiddle .
i think they got me .
no - nothing . besides , it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
we did n't see anything - - did we ?
knock it off , will you ?
we could 've had three weeks in florida - all expenses paid . lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish ...
i 'll think of something . do n't crowd me .
it 's a hundred miles , joe - it 's snowing - how are we going to get there ?
it 's twelve bucks . we can get one of the overcoats out of hock .
all the way to urbana - for a one night stand ?
josephine and geraldine ! come on !
now you 're talking ! we pick up a couple of second-hand wigs - a little padding here and there - call ourselves josephine and geraldine -
you 've flipped your wig !
but , joe - three weeks in florida ! we could borrow some clothes from the girls in the chorus -
no . and he ai n't been eating so good , either . he 's got an empty stomach and it 's gone to his head .
yeah , that 's what he means . good old nellie ! i ought to wring her neck !
you mean it 's a girls ' band ?
we 're not too late , are we ?
nellie told us about it .
- type o .
right . we have the same blood type ...
so i had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion ... right ?
it did ? boy , did it ever !
do n't you remember ? he has this bad tooth - it got impacted - the whole jaw swole up -
with me ?
with you .
yeah - where were you ?
look at the bull fiddle - it 's dressed warmer than i am .
i thought you were n't talking to me .
greased lightning ! why do i listen to you ? i ought to have my head examined !
look , stupid , he 's ten to one . tomorrow , we 'll have twenty overcoats !
but we 'll freeze - it 's below zero - we 'll catch pneumonia .
i told you - it 's a sure thing .
sam the bookie ? nothing doing ! you 're not putting my overcoat on that dog !
shut up , will you ? i wonder how much sam the bookie will give up for our overcoats ?
of course , the landlady is going to lock us out - moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we ca n't borrow any more from the girls , because they 're on their way to jail -
quiet - i 'm thinking .
well , that solves one problem . we do n't have to worry about who to pay first .
do n't look now - but the whole town is under water !
suppose lake michigan overflows ?
hey , joe !
suppose mary pickford divorces douglas fairbanks ?
jerry-boy - why do you have to paint everything so black ? suppose you get hit by a truck ? suppose the stock market crashes ?
but suppose it does n't ?
what are you worried about ? this job is going to last a long time .
but suppose he loses ?
look at those odds - ten to one . if he wins , we can pay everybody .
what are you giving me with the rabbit ?
he 's a shoo-in . i got the word from max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
you 're going to bet my money on a dog ?
first thing tomorrow we 're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on greased lightning .
we 're not ?
no we 're not .
first thing tomorrow we 're going to pay everybody a little something on account .
of course i am .
you 're right , joe .
how can you be so selfish ? we owe back rent - we 're in four eighty-nine bucks to moe 's delicatessen - we 're being sued by three chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we 've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
it 's just a little inlay - it does n't even have to be gold -
dentist ? we been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week 's pay on your teeth ?
because i lost a filling in my back tooth . i got ta go to the dentist tomorrow .
yeah . why ?
i mean , we get paid tonight , do n't we ?
i 'll say .
say , joe - tonight 's the night , is n't it ?
that 's what i call a louse ! if i were you , sugar , i 'd throw that bracelet right back in his face .
he 's going to south america to marry some other girl - that 's what they call high finance .
thirty-four .
junior gave it to me . it must have at least thirty stones -
i always did .
you like it ?
how did you get that bracelet ?
and talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries .
what for ?
of course not . as a matter of fact , it was just the other way around . you see he needs help .
did he get fresh ?
i know what you need - a slug of bourbon .
i thought i heard voices - and i just had to talk to somebody . i do n't feel like going to sleep .
yes .
no !
yes . he wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he 's going to pick me up at the pier .
no !
what do you think , josephine ? what does it say in your crystal ball ?
i hope so .
what do you mean , maybe ? i saw the way he looked at you . he 'll be there for sure .
i met one of them .
oh , come on - you can do better than that .
that 's it . something tells me she 's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit .
do you suppose she went out shopping ?
yeah . this is one for ripley .
believe it or not - josephine predicted the whole thing .
no , no , sugar - wait . i have a feeling she 's going to show up any minute .
well , i 'll come back later .
that 's funny . josie - i ca n't imagine where she can be .
i guess she 's not in here .
josephine -
oh yes , we do !
we do n't have to run .
neither can i. come on - lets go up to her room and tell her - right now .
will she be surprised . i just ca n't wait to see her face -
yeah - josephine .
if i 'd been watching my step , i never would have met him . wait till i tell josephine .
sugar , dear - let me give you some advice . if i were a girl - and i am - i 'd watch my step .
now look , daphne - hands off - i saw him first .
well , i 'll be - ! how about that guy ?
come on , daphne .
oh , please do come . do n't disappoint us . it 'll be such fun . and bring your yacht .
or was it bryn mawr ?
i 'm a what ?
it sleeps twelve . this is my friend daphne . she 's a vassar girl .
his yacht ?
vanity fair ?
i recognized him too - his picture was in vanity fair .
okay .
run along , daphne - i 'll catch up with you .
come on , sugar - time to change for dinner .
you 're so flat-chested . clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me .
what 's that ?
but there 's one thing i envy you for .
that 's from carrying around the bull fiddle .
i mean , your shoulders - and your arms -
you should have seen me before i went on a diet .
you know , daphne - i had no idea you were such a big girl .
just a little trick i picked up in the elevator .
what do you think you 're doing ?
she 'll rub it on me - and i 'll rub it on her - and we 'll rub it on each other - bye .
oh , i have some suntan lotion .
we 'll rent some at the bathhouse . how about you , josephine ?
see ? she does n't have one either - you do n't ?
you betcha .
a bunch of us girls are going for a swim . want to come along ?
here you are , sugar .
thank you , daphne .
i 'll carry the instruments .
i 'm just going to get some ice .
not you , sugar .
oh , sugar . you 're going to spoil my surprise .
and bring the cocktail shaker .
we have some bourbon - lets make manhattans .
who needs vermouth ?
no fair guessing .
here . this 'll put hair on your chest .
we better have a drink first .
when ?
uh-uh . not yet .
what 's the surprise ?
so spill it . spills , thrills , laughs , games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party .
i may spill something .
no - no lights . we do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party .
you better put on the lights . i ca n't see what i 'm doing .
i tell you - this is the only way to travel .
half-full .
how 's the bottle ?
i 'm fine .
you all right ?
i know where to get some . do n't move .
you got some ?
look , sugar , if you feel you 're coming down with something , the best thing is a shot of whiskey .
i have a very low resistance .
i 'm not that sick .
maybe i 'd better go before i catch something .
i 'm a very sick girl .
what did you say ?
i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl , i 'm a girl -
let me warm them a little . there - is n't that better ?
is n't that ridiculous ?
and you 've got cold feet .
that 's ridiculous .
and your head is hot .
that 's ridiculous .
why you poor thing - you 're trembling all over .
no , no .
anything wrong ?
interesting .
when i was a little girl , on cold nights like this , i used to crawl into bed with my sister . we 'd cuddle up under the covers , and pretend we were lost in a dark cave , and were trying to find out way out .
no . it 's nice and cozy .
i 'm not crowding you , am i ?
stay as long as you 'd like .
i 'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep .
we wo n't tell anybody - not even josephine .
i do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots .
sssh . sweet sue .
and that 's one of them .
oh , i can think of a million things -
if there 's anything i can do for you -
it must be freezing outside . when i think of you - and your poor ukulele -
if it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . i 'd be out there in the middle of nowhere , sitting on my ukulele .
it 's nothing . i just think us girls should stick together .
i wanted to thank you for covering for me . you 're a real pal .
oh - sugar !
honey - she called me honey .
good night , honey .
good night , sugar .
see you around , girls .
i 'll say .
are my seams straight ?
i do n't want you to think that i 'm a drinker . i can stop any time i want to - only i do n't want to . especially when i 'm blue .
we 'll take a rain check .
i do n't really have much of a voice - but then it 's not much of a band , either . i 'm only with 'em because i 'm running away .
she sings , too .
i 'm sugar cane .
that 's us . i 'm daphne - and this is josephine .
that 's all right . i was afraid it was sweet sue . you wo n't tell anybody , will you ?
terribly sorry .
oh !
i 'm sorry . i was having a nightmare . something i ate . i 'm not at all well . see ? hot water bottle .
what 's the big idea ?
i was it .
i thought you said three years .
yes . for a whole year .
did n't you girls say you went to a conservatory ?
oh - those . i do n't know . mice ?
how did those holes get there ?
oh - here and there - and around .
where did you girls play before ?
this is our manager , mr. bienstock . i 'm sweet sue .
brand new .
look , if william morris does n't come through -
hello , mr. morris ? this is poliakoff , in chicago . say , you would n't have a couple of girl musicians available ? a sax player and a base ?
what 's with him - he drinks ?
wait a minute , joe . lets talk this over . why could n't we do it ? last year , when we played in that gypsy tearoom , we wore gold earrings . and you remember when you booked us with that hawaiian band ? grass skirts !
yes , i 'm holding on .
we could -
- and you got to be girls .
we could dye our hair .
- you got to be blonde -
we could pass for that .
you 're the wrong shape . goodbye .
what 's wrong with us ?
the florida job ?
it 's about the florida job .
well - nobody 's perfect .
but you do n't understand ! i 'm a man !
we 'll adopt some .
and i can never have children .
i forgive you .
and i have a terrible past . for three years now , i 've been living with a saxophone player .
i do n't care .
and i smoke . i smoke all the time .
it does n't matter .
well , to begin with , i 'm not a natural blonde .
why not ?
oh , no you do n't ! look , osgood - i 'm going to level with you . we ca n't get married at all .
we can have it altered .
osgood - i ca n't get married in your mother 's dress . she and i - we ' not built the same way .
i called mama - she was so happy she cried - she wants you to have her wedding gown - it 's white lace .
flower girl .
another bridesmaid ?
come one !
pleased to meet you .
this is my friend josephine - she 's going to be a bridesmaid .
sorry .
you 're leading again .
yes , osgood ?
daphne ...
you 're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself .
you know something , mr. fielding ? you 're dynamite !
they got a cuban band that 's the berries . why do n't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn ?
about that roadhouse -
who ?
well , i 'll be - ! he does have a bicycle .
well , then , why do n't we go dancing ? i know a little road-house , down the coast -
i 'll throw up !
but it 's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
no , thank you . i 'll walk .
please . it wo n't happen again .
oh , you do n't get off that easy .
this is where i get off .
goodbye ?
goodbye , mr. fielding .
she does n't approve of girls who smoke .
why ?
my last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know , sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - zowie ! - but mama broke it up .
wan na bet ?
you must be quite a girl .
most of the time i slap it .
fascinating . do you use a bow or do you just pluck it ?
bull fiddle .
oh , of course . which of these instruments do you play ?
sorry . i 'll be on the bandstand .
if i promise not to be a naughty boy - how about dinner tonight ?
well , pull in your reel , mr. fielding . you 're barking up the wrong fish .
so this year , when george white 's scandals opened , she packed me off to florida . right now she thinks i 'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing .
i 'm not surprised .
mama is keeping score . frankly , she 's getting rather annoyed with me
you 're not sure ?
no - it 's showgirls . i 've been married seven or eight times .
you invest in shows ?
yes , indeed . it 's cost my family quite a bit of money .
you do n't say .
you know , i 've always been fascinated by show business .
personally , i 'm type o .
it certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here .
thank you . are n't you a sweetheart ?
let me carry one of the instruments .
me too . bye now .
if there is one thing i admire , it 's a girl with a shapely ankle .
i am cinderella the second .
i am osgood fielding the third .
help yourself .
just a moment , miss - may i ?
that 's good thinking . daphne 's a push-over for him .
oh , that 's all taken care of . i 'm giving them shore leave . we 'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and i checked with the coast guard - there 'll be a full moon tonight - oh , and tell her i got a new batch of rudy vallee records -
just the two of you ? what about the crew ?
the new caledonia . that 's the name of it . the old caledonia went down during a wild party off cape hatteras . but tell her not to worry - this is going to be a quiet little midnight snack - just the two of us .
got it . supper - yacht - after the show - i 'll tell her . your yacht ?
well , it is to me . will you give her a message ? i 'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight .
this is her roommate . daphne ca n't talk right now . is it anything urgent ?
oh , no !
i do n't mean to be forward - but ai n't i had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before ?
you wo n't breathe nothing ' - not even air .
we wo n't breathe a word .
i do n't like no witnesses .
you ai n't going nowhere .
to urbana . it 's a hundred miles .
wait a minute . where do you think you 're going ?
we 're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - nellie weinmeyer 's car - there 's a dance tonight - come on , jerry .
do n't i know you two from somewhere ?
my car ? why , you -
good ! then you wo n't be needing your car .
yes , joe .
and you 'll be in all evening ?
i 'm not doing anything . i just thought i 'd go home and have some cold pizza -
because i got some plans -
why ?
please , jerry - that 's no way to talk . nellie baby - what are you doing tonight ?
it 's three weeks in florida -
what 's the job ?
the minute we get a job , i 'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
you 're making it up pretty good so far .
nellie baby , i 'll make it up to you .
oh ?
what a heel ! i spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled , i buy me a new negligee , i bake him a great big pizza pie ... - and where were you ?
now look , nellie - if it 's about last saturday night - i can explain everything .
thank you .
oh , it 's you ! you got a lot of nerve -
anything today ?
you got it . it 's six dollars a man . be on the campus in urbana at eight o'clock -
we 'll take it !
look , if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight - at the university of illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a st. valentine 's dance .
william morris !
no , we could n't !
you got to be under twenty-five -
what kind of band is this , anyway ?
it 's not the backs that worry me .
the wrong shape ? you looking for hunchbacks or something ?
the instruments are right , but you are not . i want to speak to mr. morris .
you need a bass and a sax , do n't you ?
what are you - a couple of comedians ? get out of here ! long distance ? get me the william morris agency in new york .
nellie , get me long distance . what is it ?
hey , sig - can we talk to you ?
there are two things i will not put up with during working hours . one is liquor - and the other one is men .
we got time off for good behavior .
all right - lets take it from the top . and put a little heat under it , will you ?
we got it second-hand .
would you mind rejoining the living ? goose it up a little .
no - funerals .
hey , sheboygan - you two - what was your last job - playing square dances ?
yes , we 're the new girls .
you two from the poliakoff agency ?
well , here we are .
that 's right - pour it on . talk me out of it .
do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
i know . every time !
you do n't want me , sugar - i 'm a liar and a phony - a saxophone player - one of those no-goodnicks you 've been running away from -
i told you - i 'm not very bright .
sugar ! what do you think you 're doing ?
how can i ? no matter where i go , there 'll always be a shell station on the corner . i 'll bring this back when it 's empty .
you 'll forget him , sugar .
he was the first nice guy i ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything .
daphne -
i do n't know . all of a sudden , i 'm thirsty .
what 's the matter , sugar ?
goodbye , my darling .
well , anchors aweigh , you have a bon voyage . and if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding , we 'll be through here in a couple of weeks .
oh . the navigator just came in - we 're ready to cast off .
i did n't do anything . it just happened .
not always . but i want you to know i 'm very grateful for what you did for me .
real diamonds . they must be worth their weight in gold . are you always this generous ?
what 's what ? oh , that . just a little going away present .
yes , they 're here . oh - white orchids . would you believe it - i have n't had white orchids since i was a debutante . what 's this ?
smart move . oh , by the way - did you get my flowers ? you know , those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over long island , and they flew them down this morning .
but you have . you 've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow i 'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of venezuelan oil .
i only wish there were something i could do for you .
i knew you would .
oh , of course . i understand . at least , i think i do .
according to our tax advisers , she 's only so-so . but - that 's the way the oil gushes . a man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
oh - that kind of a merger . is she young ? pretty ?
it 's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the venezuelan syndicate has a daughter , and -
you 're not ?
quite a while . as a matter of fact , i 'm not coming back at all .
a merger ? how long will you be gone ?
you see , we have those oil interests in venezuela - and i just got a cable from dad - the board of directors decided on a merger .
where to ? south america ? oh . that is unexpected .
not tomorrow , either . you see , i have to leave - something unexpected came up - i 'm sailing right away .
tomorrow night ?
i 'm afraid not . i ca n't make it tonight .
i 'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show .
yes . now about our date for tonight ...
that 's funny - i never slept better . and i had the most wonderful dream . i was still on the yacht , and the anchor broke loose - and we drifted for days and days - you were the captain and i was the crew - i kept a lookout for icebergs , and i sorted your shells , and mixed your cocktails , and wiped the steam off your glasses - and when i woke up , i felt like swimming right back to you .
daphne has a beau - i have a beau - if we could only find somebody for you .
me ?
that 's wonderful . poor josephine .
from a rich millionaire .
really ?
i 'm going to see him again tonight - and every night - i think he 's going to propose to me - as soon as he gets up his nerve .
gee , i wish i 'd been there .
nice ? it was suicidally beautiful .
did you have a nice time ?
oh , no . i 'm off that stuff - for good .
let 's make it an even million .
eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
how much do i owe the milk fund so far ?
good morning .
good night .
oh , you know - junior league - charity bazaars - i used to sell kisses for the milk fund .
where did you learn to kiss like that ?
mineral baths - now really !
they told me i was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you 're making a chump out of all those experts .
thank you .
i never knew it could be like this .
i must be - because your glasses are beginning to steam up .
i think you 're on the right track .
lets throw another log on the fire .
i got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame .
i 'm not quite sure . try it again .
well - ?
so inhale !
it 's like smoking without inhaling .
you 're not giving yourself a chance . do n't fight it . relax .
look , it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it 's no use . i think the light switch is over there - - and that 's the radio . it 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf .
would you like a little more champagne ? and maybe if we had some music - - how do you dim these lights ?
i 'm afraid not . terribly sorry .
anything this time ?
all right - if you insist .
i may not be dr. freud or a mayo brother or one of those french upstairs girls - but could i take another crack at it ?
what is it ?
would you do me a favor ?
if i ever found a girl that could - i 'd marry her like that .
do n't talk like that . i 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
i have . spent six months in vienna with professor freud - flat on my back - - then there were the mayo brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if i were n't such a coward , i 'd kill myself .
maybe if you saw a good doctor ...
thanks just the same .
is that anything ?
why ?
have you ever tried american girls ?
my family did everything they could - hired the most beautiful french upstairs maids - got a special tutor to read me all the books that were banned in boston - imported a whole troupe of balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails - what a waste of money !
is it that hopeless ?
what else is there for me ?
how can you think about food at a time like this ?
yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it ? mint sauce or cranberries ?
you poor , poor boy .
ever since then - numb - no feelings . like my heart was shot full of novocaine .
talk about sad .
yes . eight hours later they brought her up by mule - i gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - type o - it was too late .
oh , no !
well , it was my freshman year at princeton - there was this girl - her name was nellie - her father was vice-president of hupmobile - she wore glasses , too . that summer we spent our vacation at the grand canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge , watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - i took off my glasses - i took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
oh , you could n't possibly .
i do n't want to bore you .
what happened ?
not anymore . i was in love once - but i 'd rather not talk about it . how about a little cold pheasant ?
you mean you ca n't fall in love ?
oh , it 's not your fault . it 's just that every now and then mother nature throws somebody a dirty curve . something goes wrong inside .
that makes me feel just awful .
complete washout .
nothing at all ?
see ? nothing .
have i ? i 'm trying all the time .
have you tried ?
it 's more like a mental block . when i 'm with girls , it does nothing to me .
you mean - like frigid ?
they just sort of leave me cold .
what thing ?
well , i do n't know how to put it - but i have this thing about girls .
harmless - how ?
oh , it 's not that . it 's just that i 'm - harmless .
well , of course , i 'm sure you 're a gentleman .
you 're flattering me .
it 's not the icebergs . but there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this .
oh , it 's perfectly safe . we 're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the coast guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around .
you know , i 've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean .
completely .
you mean we 're alone on the boat ?
it 's the crews ' night off .
what 's on thursdays ?
yea , of course . now where could they have put it ? on thursdays , i 'm sort of lost around here .
where 's your shell collection ?
i 'll say . i had two ponies drowned under me .
water polo - is n't that terribly dangerous ?
trophies . you know - skeet-shooing , dog-breeding , water polo ...
look at all that silverware .
bon voyage .
down the hatch - as we say at sea .
i do n't mind if i do .
champagne ?
they shrink when they 're marinated .
a herring ? is n't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ?
oh - a member of the herring family .
what is it ?
caught him off cape hatteras .
what a beautiful fish .
it 's all right for a bachelor .
it 's exquisite - like a floating mansion .
of course . on thursdays , they always serve me in the small salon .
oh - in here .
yes - that 's our hurricane cellar .
oh , you have an upstairs and a downstairs .
yes - now let 's see - where do you suppose the steward set it up ?
love it . which way ?
well , that depends - on whether you 're coming or going - i mean , normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that 's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne ?
my dad is more interested in railroads . baltimore and ohio . which is the port and which is the starboard ?
mother keeps hers in southampton - and dad took his to venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line .
three ?
just regulation size . we have three like this .
it looked so small from the beach - but when you 're on it , it 's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer .
it 's not how long it takes - it 's who 's taking you .
do you mind riding backwards ? it may take a little longer -
looks like they 're on the wrong track .
i just got this motorboat - it 's an experimental model .
it 's sort of funny - you being out of gas - i mean , shell oil and everything -
i seem to be out of gas .
it 's the thought that counts .
i wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of long island is fogged in .
thank you . and thank you for the flowers .
it 's not how long you wait - it 's who you 're waiting for .
been waiting long ?
oh , josephine - just imagine - me , sugar kowalczyk , from sandusky , ohio , on a millionaire 's yacht . if my mother could only see me now -
you heard her - yes .
for me ? it 's shell oil .
well , you know how those millionaires are . these came for you .
i guess he 's not going to show up - it 's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot ?
because he said he 's coming to hear us play - maybe .
i am ?
anyway , you 're going to meet him tonight .
shells ? whatever for ?
oh , i 'm not going to let this one get away . he 's so cute - collects shells .
maybe you 'd better go after him - if you do n't want to lose him .
well , he 's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he 's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers .
you do n't say !
shell oil , junior . he 's got millions - he 's got glasses - and he 's got a yacht .
one of whom ?
they repealed prohibition ?
guess !
what ?
the most wonderful thing happened -
oh , i did n't hear you come in .
josephine .
if it 's at all possible -
and you will come to hear us tonight ?
it 's been delightful meeting you both .
well , i guess i 'd better go -
yes , you 're in the way . he 's waiting for a signal from his yacht .
would you mind moving along , please ?
please - no names . just call me junior .
shell oil ?
yes . so did my father and my grandfather - we 've all had this passion for shells - that 's why we named the oil company after it .
you collect shells ?
it 's on the account of the shells . that 's my hobby .
oh ?
i only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out .
why ?
i 'd like to - but it may be rather difficult .
i thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play .
tonight ?
maybe i 'll tell you when i know you a little better . what are you doing tonight ?
what theory ?
you see , i have this theory about men with glasses .
i beg your pardon ?
you 're very kind . i 'll bet you 're also very gentle - and helpless -
you know , it 's amazing we never ran into each other before . i 'm sure i would have remembered anybody as attractive as you .
- and always the same four hundred .
- riding to hounds -
- opening of the opera -
- inauguration balls -
they do indeed . daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent , but i do n't care . it was such a bore - coming-out parties , cotillions -
good school ! and your family does n't object to your career ?
so do i. as a matter of fact , i spent three years at the sheboygan conservatory of music .
oh . well , i guess some like it hot . but personally , i prefer classical music .
yeah . real hot .
syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz ?
oh , yes . quite . you know - vassar , bryn mawr - we 're only doing this for a lark .
you 're society girls ?
well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel . sweet sue and her society syncopators .
for your own amusement ?
no - the ukulele . and i sing .
could be . do you play the market ?
i 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars .
up , up , up .
how 's the stock market ?
that 's very interesting .
well , i 'm not .
i 'm not interested at all .
no , my cocktail steward . look , if you 're interested in whether i 'm married or not -
and who mixes the cocktails - your wife ?
no , my flag steward .
i quite agree . tell me , who runs up that flat - your wife ?
certainly not . with all that unrest in the world , i do n't think anybody should have a yacht that sleeps more than twelve .
which one is yours - the big one ?
you have a yacht ?
they run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it 's time for cocktails .
your view of what ?
would you mind moving just a little ? you 're blocking my view .
that must be it .
possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - vanity fair -
your face is familiar .
not at all .
are you staying at the hotel ?
not very likely .
have n't i seen you somewhere before ?
now , really -
who are you ?
thank you .
well , do n't worry . i wo n't sue you - no matter who you are .
because usually , when people find out who i am , they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer , and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars .
why ?
i wish you 'd make sure .
i do n't think so .
you 're not hurt , are you ?
my fault .
oh , i 'm terribly sorry .
she does n't need one . i do n't have one either .
wait a minute , daphne . you have n't got a bathing suit .
just my feminine intuition .
what makes you so sure ?
forget it , sugar , will you ? forget about saxophone players . you 're going to meet a millionaire - a young one .
what else ? and was i ever crazy about him . two in the morning , he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad , so i brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face .
saxophone player ?
414 - that 's the same room number i had in cincinnati - my last time around with a male band . what a heel he was .
so do i. but do n't worry - we 'll be seeing a lot of each other .
i wish they 'd put us in the same room .
seventy-five . that 's three-quarters of a century . makes a girl think .
i 'll bet there is n't one of them under seventy-five .
well , there they are - more millionaires than you can shake a stick at .
good night , sugar .
thanks , honey .
not at all .
would you mind terribly ?
want to switch berths with me ?
bienstock . he snores to beat the band . we cut cards to see who sleeps over him , and i always lose . would n't you know ?
why not ?
i might as well stay in there . i wo n't be able to sleep anyway .
okay , sugar - all clear . you better go back to bed .
search me . i mean - i 'll see .
what 's happened ?
i hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop .
happy days .
they get those weak eyes from reading - you know , all those long columns of tiny figures in the wall street journal .
well , now that you 've mentioned it -
men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . have n't you ever noticed ?
glasses ?
i want mine to wear glasses .
yeah . with money like rockefeller , and shoulders like johnny weismuller -
maybe you 'll meet one too , josephine .
you 're entitled .
oh , i do n't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste .
going to catch yourself a rich bird ?
millionaires . flocks of them . they all go south for the winter . like birds .
what 's in florida ?
about the future . you know - like a husband ? that 's why i 'm glad we 're going to florida .
about what ?
that 's a quarter of a century . makes a girl think .
you are ?
you know i 'm going to be twenty-five in june ?
i can tell you one thing - it 's not going to happen to me again . ever . i 'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
brains are n't everything .
so you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job , and the next saxophone player , and it 's the same thing all over again . see what i mean ? - not very bright .
men !
then one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone , and all that 's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste , all squeezed out .
you do n't say ?
you do n't know what they 're like . you fall for them and you love 'em - you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the graf zeppelin - and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
yeah .
that 's why i joined this band . safety first . anything to get away from those bums .
yeah .
but you 're a girl , thank goodness .
you know - i play tenor sax .
every time !
that so ?
especially tenor sax . i do n't know what it is , but they just curdle me . all they have to do is play eight bars of `` come to me my melancholy baby '' - and my spine turns to custard , and i get goose-pimply all over - and i come to them .
really ?
you see , i have this thing about saxophone players .
bingo ?
i ca n't trust myself . the moment i 'd start with a new band - bingo !
you ca n't trust those guys .
i 'll say .
rough ?
that 's what i 'm running away from . i worked with six different ones in the last two years . oh , brother !
me ?
have you ever been with a male band ?
afford it ?
i used to sing with male bands . but i ca n't afford it any more .
then why did you take this job ?
no , just dumb . if i had any brains , i would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band .
i would n't say that . careless , maybe .
i 'm not very bright , i guess .
if bienstock catches you again - what 's the matter with you , anyway ?
better keep a lookout .
sugar , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble .
put it here .
all the girls drink - but i 'm the one that gets caught . that 's the story of my life . i always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop .
we understand .
do n't get me started on that . want a drink ? it 's bourbon .
running away ? from what ?
i play the ukulele . and i sing too .
oh .
on the baltimore and ohio .
where did he conduct ?
yes . i come from a very musical family . my mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor .
if they catch me once more , they 'll boot me out of the band . you the replacement for the bass and the sax ?
tell what ?
show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three .
where are they holding the wake ? i 'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers .
please !
that 's because i 've been on the wagon .
i do n't believe i 've seen you at any of our services before .
i come to the old lady 's funeral .
good evening , sir .
some people got no respect for the dead .
who 's going to raid a funeral ?
better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided .
sorry , sir . that 's reserved for members of the immediate family .
have n't you got another pew - not so close to the band ? how about that one ?
make is scotch . a demitasse . with a little soda on the side .
scotch coffee , canadian coffee , sour-mash coffee ...
coffee ?
sorry , sir , we only serve coffee .
booze .
what 'll it be , sir ?
you boys know anything about any garage - or any witnesses ?
me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over chicago .
you and who else ?
quit kidding . you did that vulcanizing job on toothpick charlie - and we know it .
i sleep with my spats on .
you shave with your spats on ?
i cut myself shaving .
because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them .
why ?
ever hear of the deluxe french cleaners on wabash avenue ?
clark street ? never heard of it .
where did they play it - in a garage on clark street ?
that 's an opera , you ignoramus .
what 's his first name ? and where does he live ?
me ? i was at rigoletto .
say , maestro - where were you at three o'clock on st. valentine 's day ?
big joke !
i heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so i thought i better be around in case anybody decides to sing .
hello , copper . what brings you down to florida ?
well , spats colombo - if i were saw one .
these are my lawyers - all harvard men .
if you want to , you can call your lawyer .
you 're wasting the taxpayers ' money .
toothpick charlie ? never heard of him .
from who ? toothpick charlie , maybe ?
we got different information .
mozarella ? never heard of him .
come on , spats - we know you own this joint . mozarella is just fronting for you .
me ? i 'm just a customer here .
embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof .
big joke . who 's the rap this time ?
you 'll like it there . i 'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped !
i never join nothin ' .
a little country club we run for retired bootleggers . i 'm gon na put your name up for membership .
go where ?
okay , spats - the services are over . lets go .
goodbye , charlie .
look , chief - i better blow now , because if spats colombo sees me , it 's goodbye charlie .
okay , charlie .
if you want a ringside table , tell 'em you 're one of the pall bearers .
thanks , charlie .
i come to grandma 's funeral . here 's your admission card .
that 's very refreshing . now what 's the password ?
spats colombo .
refresh my memory .
i already told you .
and who runs it ?
yes , sir .
all right , charlie - this the joint ?
orders from little bonaparte .
what for ?
yeah . you never know who 's going to be next . okay , spats . report to the sergeant- at-arms .
well , we all got to go sometime .
we thought you was all broken up about toothpick charlie .
why would n't i ?
hi , spats . we was laying eight to one you would n't show .
no , spats - no , no , no - no !
too bad , charlie . you would have had three eights . goodbye , charlie !
honest , spats . i had nothing to do with it .
so now i got all those coffins on my hands - and i hate to see them go to waste .
i do n't know what you 're talking about .
oh , i would n't say that . you were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends ...
you do n't owe me no nothing .
just dropped in to pay my respects .
what is it , spats ? what do you want here ?
hello , charlie . long time no see .
yeah . most important day of my life . whatever . listen , i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons : i love you , youre my favorite , and only , half-sister , blah blah blah . but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years , i knew you wouldnt outshine me . but here it is , my big day . my big day . and something doesnt feel right . maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night , i dont know , but your misery just isnt working for me anymore .
wow . you look beautiful .
sure , disappear . weve been walking away our whole lives .
you know what ? im not having this conversation right now .
hey .
hey .
you practically bribed him with your erector set .
so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat . he wanted to play with me .
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day , tony walked me home from school . he was my first boyfriend . i was fourteen .
im fine . i promise .
are you sure youre okay ?
i should get going .
what ? why ? what do you mean ?
god , kat ! please . dont be nice to me . i can take anything right now but you being nice to me .
but i do . i will . youre my sister .
when i freaked out at the pub ? that was nothing , just nerves . dont worry about it .
do you want to come in for a minute ? we could talk about --
the wedding . i am so , so bad ! i dont think i should be allowed to get married .
pub golf ?
i dont think i can go through with this .
bacardi 151 .
why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole ?
drunk isnt the same thing as happy , amy .
oh , shut up and be happy . its always this or that . youre never happy , you frowny-faced grumplestilskin .
christ , amy .
did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed ?
did kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath ?
but im not taking your name , buster . im a feminist ! i need icey ! mr. husband-man , get me more icey !
except its scotch .
perfect . all ginny .
exactly ! todays my day . tomorrow will be my day . and the day after that ? my day .
theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you ?
you know what i love about all this ?
and she wonders why i swim to the bottom of a lemondrop every time i see her .
or kat ... .
if ed ever found out ... .
still --
it was such a long time ago .
actually , i do .
you know all that if these walls could talk stuff ? do you believe it ? that a place has a memory ?
to make sure youre okay .
what for ?
sorry to interrupt . your dad sent me .
its not me . i swear . its her . shes magic .
fred astaire and whats her face !
last night ?
jeffrey told her last night .
does kat know ?
i knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together . i never in a million years would have dreamt it was jeffrey .
say something . please .
your probably best off pretending youre asleep .
whatever you do , dont mention italy . or politics . or baby buggies . or edith piaf .
youd better get going . my parents will be round to cart you off to the country .
so she flirted with tony , and you got mad and sent him away . who did that leave ? you and amy . reunited .
she did ?
anyway , when that boy came over , it was the first time you ever did anything without her . and amy wasnt just jealous ... she was sad and lonely . she missed you .
mom , please .
before tony , you and your sister were best friends . i couldnt split you up . if your sister ate the spinach , you ate the spinach . if you threw up -- .
trust me . this is bigger than tony pee-pants .
theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story , you know .
i was pretty hard on her last night . and now shes getting married .
whats going on with you two ?
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door , i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches .
im an american and in america , people sue . so to prevent a lawsuit , i baked a tart . and i dont bake .
it was just after we moved here . my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they havent made up since .
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything . the fall of the british empire , the cold war , the internet .
why should this be any different ? besides , i have to initiate nick into the family .
oh , no . she tells this story at every major holiday .
i blame tony pee-pants !
oh , dont be that way .
id be happy to . youre welcome .
sir , yes , sir !
im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces . oh , and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens .
moms refining her strategy for dday .
im not as square as my daughter thinks .
huh ?
my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture . she thinks its --
why , with you .
wheres nick sleeping ?
yeah .
i figured you could pick up your car tomorrow .
you heading to the train station ?
yeah , kind of .
i look like a total wanker , dont i ?
dont be ridiculous . its late and the place is empty . just take my car .
ill just check into a hotel .
fair enough , but im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like ...
i had to say something to get you here .
i thought you said you were crap .
im a hooker .
i think i love you , mate . how do you know so much about so much ?
its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute , need a prostitute . you did the right thing .
just because some slags been paid for , doesnt mean youve got to ... you know .
you are taking the piss ?
um , just about everyone .
whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding , honestly ?
doesnt look like nothing .
nothing .
and you do now ?
i didnt deserve her back then .
lasik surgeon , actually .
oh , shut up . youre an optician .
thats when i realized i wanted to be a doctor .
but , somehow , it was kats arse that was stung by nettles . and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf .
and kat was fully clothed .
oh , yes . right . the rat and parrot .
it was before you started going out . we had lunch at that inn on the lake .
no .
remember when we went hiking in the lake district and amy was wearing that little bikini thing .
no , thats not it .
other than , hes shagging your exgirlfriend ?
theres something about him thats just a bit odd .
what ?
whats his problem ?
no , i cant . were late for a dance lesson . i guess youll have to finish up later .
sorry , can you give us a moment ?
hey , man .
you yanks and your therapy . its great . its all a bit too touchy-feely for me .
no , tell me .
nothing , nothing .
what ?
crikey .
shrink , actually .
ah , a philosopher .
oh , hello .
hey .
i shagged amy . two years ago . thats why i ended it . and then , after you left , sod it , we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad . and , you know , morally wrong . then there was that one other time . and that was it .
im sorry ?
i slept with your sister .
its the past . its nothing but ghosts . so just get it off your chest , then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu .
well , it was a big deal . as late as ... yesterday . or this morning . but not anymore .
brilliant .
relax . take a breath and just say it . its no big deal . i promise .
bollocks , im sorry . i had no idea this would be so difficult .
when we were together i was too here , now im not here enough .
youre not even listening .
its not supposed to be anything , kat . its just my rather feeble attempt to ... . oh , i dont know . you see , i thought i could deny my feelings --
is this supposed to be an apology ?
well , we had a lot of good years , but then ...
not for a dog .
right . seven . christ , thats a long time , isnt it ?
seven if you count the on-and-off years . which i do .
you were so good to me . i swear i never meant to hurt you . we were together what , five years ?
i should have told you why i broke up with you . i was a coward . you deserve to know .
so , whats your point ?
it was . and it took your sister getting married to get you back here .
that was a long time ago .
kat , stop it . you do . you cant even look me in the eye . you went back to the states when we split up .
um , news flash : i dont give a shit .
kat , wait . i dont want you hating me . weve never had this talk . you know how crap i am at this .
is that why you brought him ? because of me .
its called character . god , youre predictable .
kat , we must talk . this guy , theres something not quite right .
whoa , jeffrey . slow down . you and me , were the past . im not sure if you noticed , but im here with someone else .
i have regrets .
so , tell me , hows unmarried life ?
maybe not her least ... theres always --
let me guess . amy presumed id forget the rings . i think im her least favorite person . you know , i am sorry .
hey , you !
hey , yourself . i see youve met my ex .
hey , kat .
yeah ?
seeing you again ... .
hello , katmandu .
why , jeffrey . hello .
thank you .
nice speech . i thought it was touching ... and funny .
i have to . im the best man .
what ? ! no , no . you cant --
i should go .
hi .
hi .
go ahead , kat . hate me . you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing . maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship .
youre right . i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie . and after all that ? the only one who ended up falling for it was me .
youre judging me ? ! oh , thats a good one . youre lying to me , youre lying to your family , and youre lying to yourself . but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me ? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend ?
you let me make a fool of myself ! you lied to me ! i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do . its your job . its who you are . how would you even know if something were real ?
yeah ! for all i know , come monday morning , well go back to the real world and ... and youll be hiring me for your best friend !
youve always got that to hide behind , dont you ? its just business !
besides , you hired me for my discretion .
so whats with the nickname ?
he bled a bunch , but no , there was no peeing .
and thats when he peed in his pants ? after the tart ?
i didnt say he was worth it .
fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set ?
yeah .
yeah . you ?
spontaneously combust ?
what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think ?
make out with you for free .
what would you do if you were n't an escort ?
desperation ?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day .
so , whyd you say yes to me ?
when i said id never done a wedding before , i didnt say that no one ever asked . i just never said yes .
sure , but its never easy . they say theyre okay with it , and they are ... for a while . then one day , theyre not .
you have had girlfriends ?
its my job .
im sorry i was such a bitch . i really appreciate your doing this .
you paid me for a lot of reasons . closure wasnt one of them .
he was about to un-stick me ! i paid you to help me get closure .
i just hate seeing you so stuck .
oh , cut the crap !
hello , goodbye , i want you , i hate you . its all just words . none of it means anything . what matters is what you do . you either stay put or you walk away . if you look back , youre not walking away !
yup . thats why you get to keep your money .
but nothing did .
believe me , if anything had happened , that would have been one of the highlights . for you .
what ?
no , no . the three hundred is for you doing it to me .
and what if i didnt want you to ... to do that to me ?
not dollars . pounds .
so youre telling me . if something had happened last night ... it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars ? thats a down payment on a ford focus !
not if you take an advance on your credit card .
dont they have a limit at those machines ?
if i was going to charge you , i would have told you beforehand . i thought i explained that .
of course not . how ... how could it be ? nothing happened .
is this for last night ?
we kissed . made out a little . then you passed out .
are you sure ?
ive got this bad taste in my mouth . what is it ? i think its the words : morally repugnant .
come on .
show me .
its hard to explain .
i disappear . its not about me .
subtle ?
oh , come on . youre like the yoda of escorts .
i swear . i dont have a signature move .
okay .
dont stop asking questions , okay ?
this is awkward for me . talking about it makes me feel better .
i love that youre asking questions , but do you really want to get into all of this ?
my sixth-grade science project was entitled , love hurts : the heartbreak of human papillomavirus . trust me , im careful .
theres a guy on 81st and madison . you get your results in 24 hours . do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them ?
what do you think ?
i guess so .
are you asking me if im gay for pay ?
when youre ready to let go , to be unsingle and unmiserable , you will . until then ... .
what ? !
yes .
first of all , its never out of the blue . and second of all --
so ... what was i ... oh , yeah . do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable ? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart .
admit it . you were disturbed , but ultimately moved .
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries ?
i have a different story for every woman who asks . i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me .
you shit !
yeah . as an adult , i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex , but with rules that couldnt be violated .
oh , no .
the real story is that my mother was a hippie . and a stripper . she was insanely inappropriate with me . she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater . while i was still in the bath .
shampoo , got it !
would you grab my shampoo ?
if it makes you feel any better , to get your number , i had to cough up two round-trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini-baileys .
your friend guaranteed my anonymity .
i have a friend at the magazine .
how did you know that was me ?
well , happen , in the sense that i picked up the phone , tracked you down , flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k .
this happened to you ?
sorry . im a little nervous . i never thought something like this would happen to me .
thats right . imagine facing it alone .
not you . youre not disgusting . youre lovely . just the idea that theyd bring an escort . i mean , a stranger who , um , didnt ... who never ... . i mean , someones dead .
i think thats disgusting .
not the way youre thinking . the women wanted me there for support . you can understand that .
a wedding .
a weekend ?
have you ever done anything like this before ?
i do ?
you stand on your tiptoes .
what is ?
its cute .
what ?
graham russell and russell hitchcock .
who are they ?
im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality . except for approval . that , i cant get enough of .
you quitting ?
its okay . hell , ive never paid for it . but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me .
that wont be an issue , believe me . i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant . no offense .
great , with the occasional stabs of shame . now , listen , this covers the weekend , but as we discussed , if you want to be intimate , we talk money before anything happens .
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you ?

dont patronize me . theyve clearly been at this a while .
you have feet ?
what color are my shoes ?
exactly . i want us to look like we fit , but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit . its welcome cocktails , not prom . with this level of matchy-matchy , we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere .
you think we look like were trying too hard .
kat .

oh , no . he told you .
dad made me go over and apologize the next day .

i thought you were living in san francisco . or was it nepal ?
... but its getting there .

just drunk enough .
im worried . amys not good at drinking . she gets sooo drunk sooo fast . does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker ? is it drunker or drunker-er ?
will do .
hey , sigmund , you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party ?
-- and the ass of the man who adores her .
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass --
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them .
what do you say to that ?
what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource : your daughter .
what is it you do again ?
at least somebodys using the damn thing . i was gon na fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much , we never launched her again .
i am now , sir .
is there any other way to take it ?
im guessing maccallum , 18 years . neat , with a water-back .
means you keep me using my head , and that 's good !
what do that mean ?
whewwww ! you sure keep my mind jumping , boy !
yes , mam ...
and so you did your job , right ?
nothin ' ...
i ca n't answer that for you -- but it 's no fault of your own that you do n't know where your father is now . you tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father . come on , tell me ...
but where is my daddy ! ?
but you did all you could , david . not many little boys could 've gone on such a journey as you did .
what do i tell my mama when i get home ? i did n't find him and that 's what i wanted to do .
well , you should n't worry about him too much , david .
yes mam ...
you think about your father a lot , do n't you ?
my daddy likes to look into the dark , even when there ai n't nothin to see -- it 's what you hear he say .
what are you looking at , out there ? there 's nothing to see .
not now , david , it 's time for bed . you have a long trip ahead of you in the morning ...
i been like that myself , when i thought nobody was gon na believe me ... you wan na hear another story ? !
you could ? how ?
he was real scared nobody would believe him -- i could tell , even when he first stood up .
you know , that was a good thing you did for clarence , in class today . i believed his story , but i was afraid the other children would n't ...
oh ... . you right , that 's all that was worryin ' me right then ...
because all you could think of was getting away from the guard .
... so me and sounder , ran right by the men that was the prisoners , and crawled under the fence ! that 's when i cut my hand on the glass . it hurt like mad ! but i kept runnin ' , and then i did n't feel no more hurtin ' till i stopped runnin ' ! why was that , miss johnson ?
it was the best thing i ever been to , miss johnson !
well , how did you like the class , david ?
i have a mother and her name is rebecca -- my father 's name is nathan lee morgan , and ...
now do n't you think it 's time you told me all about yourself ?
he 'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed .
what about sounder ?
and you 're a tired little boy . i 'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep .
you 're a friendly lady , miss johnson .
why do n't you sit and i 'll read you something he said .
what he talk 'bout ?
dr. william e. b. dubois .
what 's his name ?
here 's one by a man that 's very much alive .
sure --
do n't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ai n't dead ?
colored .
and the other people you told me 'bout , they is all colored folk ?
that 's where we came from first .
that 's where we come from first ?
here it is , right here .
where is africa , miss johnson ?
they lived a long time ago -- before you and i were born .
that 's right --
and you say all them people is dead now ?
i try ...
you got a pretty house , miss johnson !
i do n't live far from here . you and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we 'll talk about how to get you back home .
thank you , miss johnson .
that does it ...
uh huh ...
did your mother know you were going to see your father ?
me and sounder went to this prison camp to see my daddy and the police guard runs us away and i fell on some glass .
it 's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this ?
sometime , but not like this .
you keep looking around , david . do n't you go to school ?
let me see it ...
david lee morgan . my dog 's name is sounder . that feels better .
my name is camille -- camille johnson and i 'm the supervisor of this school . what 's your name ?
here , you put your hand under the water and i 'll pump for you .
i do n't know , he 's in a prison camp .
is he here in borderdale ?
no , mam ... i come from way back there . me and my dog was tryin ' to find my daddy and we got lost .
you do n't live around here , do you ?
i just wanta wash my hand . it 's got blood where i hurt it .
yes mam ...
can you swim ?
no , miss johnson ...
clarence , would you tell us a story that was not true , after telling us it was ?
she was dirty and wet ...
how was your sister after you pulled her out of the water ?
me and my little sister , went down to the water hole , last saturday --
go on ...
yes , miss johnson ...
you know that the class is going to challenge your story , do n't you , clarence ?
: his mother , with her head thrown back , her eyes aglitter and laughing .
: ... finer spirits boon and guerdon for what they lose on earth by being black .
: his visit with his father at the county jail house --
: ... the chance to soar in the dim blue air above smoke is to their ...
: he , josie and earl , running and playing in the field .
: ... hearts . and to themselves in these days that try their souls ...
: the night in the woods with his father and sounder . the shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
: -- the strange endings of nature they have seen , may give the world new points of view and make their loving , living , and doing precious to all human ...
you getting the point , mrs. boatwright .
you would do that , would n't you ?
do n't tell me about what 's wrong . you come into my office as a friend and steal city files ! i could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody , that 's exactly what i 'm going to do -- and i 'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for ! you wo n't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy !
charlie , you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is ! you hear that , you and this whole damn court house ; what you are doing is wrong !
no buts , rita !
i did look , charlie , but i --
i see you found what you was lookin ' for .
no ! n-o , no !
but , charlie --
now look , rita , i do n't make the rules -- you puttin ' yourself on a limb , comin ' here , askin ' me to do a thing like this . and i be damn if i 'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy !
charlie , just because a man and his family are colored , you --
i ca n't do it , rita -- that 's the policy here on colored prisoners , and i ai n't about to change it , not even for a friend like you .
i 'm gon ' miss this ol ' raggedy place .
what 's that , son ?
you know somethin ' , daddy ?
yes , daddy ! yes !
i love you , son ! do n't ever think i do n't love you ! we gon ' get to be friends ?
now wait justa minute ! you do n't tell me what you ai n't gon na do ! i tell you ! i say , you goin ' to that school , you goin ' ! you hear me !
i wo n't go , daddy ! i wo n't go !
let me tell you somethin ' , boy ! i do n't care if both of my legs was cut off ! i can do more work in that field , than you could in a hundred years !
but , daddy , you need me here to help you in the field -- daddy , your leg is hurt -- you ca n't work like you used to . who 's gon na help you ! ? who 's gon na do the work , daddy ? !
and i wanta be with you , too , but this school is somethin ' that 's good for you -- somethin you need , like good air to breathe , and i want you to have it , boy , and that 's the way it 's gon na be !
you just came back home , daddy . i do n't wan na leave right now -- i wan na stay home and be with you .
september 4 -- how far away is that ?
dear david , if you are coming to school here , be sure to bring some warm clothes . the school term will begin september 8th , but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month . i do hope everything is fine and you will be here . give my `` hello '' to your family . yours truly , miss camille johnson ...
well , ai n't you gon ' open and read it for us ?
from miss johnson --
no , no , i 'm all right , son ... this damn leg just wo n't act right no more !
you hurt , daddy ! ?
no , son -- they 'd have to kill me before i 'd let 'em do that to me again !
you wo n't be goin ' to jail again , will you , daddy ?
wheeew ! this is some hard work , but it beats goin ' to jail .
thank you , daddy ...
i 'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin ' , david lee .
soon -- but it wo n't be too much huntin ' you 'll be doin ' , 'cordin ' to a good little story your mama told me last night -- you 'll be goin ' away from here , wo n't you ?
daddy , when is we goin ' huntin ' ?
great , son -- not like wakin ' up in jail . for a minute or two , did n't quite know where i was , but when i saw your face lookin down on me , made me know right away the day was gon na be a good one , and it all belonged to me !
you feel alright today , daddy ?
guess i ca n't just lay here , then .
they gone to the field ...
where 's everybody ?
mornin ' , daddy ...
mornin ' , son ...
come here , son ...
daddy , you home now ... that 's all i want -- i do n't want nothin ' else ...
goodnight to you , son ...
goodnight , daddy ...
i cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone ...
you bet we is !
we goin ' huntin ' again , daddy ! ?
and me too , son ! you shore done got to be such a big little man !
the rains started to come , and the prisoners were scared to run 'cause they had to wait for guards to round us up , and tell us when to move -- but we did n't mind the rain comin ' 'cause it meant we would git a little rest -- we just stood there , watchin ' the guards and they weapons get wet , and that made us all feel kinda good for a minute . i was laughin ' all over inside -- a minute , that 's all , but what a minute it was !
what happened afta that ?
into the clouds and behind the mountains .
where did the sun go to , daddy ?
that musta been afta they sent me to this place call clayburn . that was the hardest workin ' camp they sent me to . the work was so hard , you had to look for somethin ' to laugh about to keep from feelin ' the whole pain in your body . like one time , it was in the middle of the day , and there were n't no sun -- you hear that ?
where was you , daddy ?
son , that was some trip you went on ...
got it hurt in a dynamite blast , son . the dirty dogs had no more use for me , so they let me have time off my sentence , and let me come home .
what 's wrong with your leg , daddy ?
just do like i tell you -- i 'll get word to you through the visitin ' preacher .
why , daddy ; you wo n't be here ?
i do n't know , son -- they wo n't tell us things like that -- but i do n't want y'all to come here no more .
can you say what camp they gon ' send you to , daddy ?
i think so ...
it 's a shame they wo n't let 'em come in here . if i had the strength i 'd knock down these damn walls -- if i could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us , son ?
naww -- he 'll come back to you , soon as his wounds heal . this cake shore is tasty , son .
do you think he 's dead , daddy ?
he 'll show up one day .
we did n't find sounder yet .
they is ! ? it shore is good to see you , boy !
mama is outside with josie mae and earl .
hi to you , son ...
hi , daddy ...
well , looka here ...
now who says i did n't lay my mark on you , boy !
`` you lose some of the time , what you always go afta , but you lose all the time what you do n't go afta ! ''
yep . i guess you must wonder why though , what with the luck we havin ' , but like i always say --
we goin ' huntin ' again tomorrow ?
when the fall comes in these parts , the night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin ' all night , and not see a thing out yonder .
yes , sir ...
readin ' must be somethin ' powerful , huh , son ?
yes , sir -- i learn to write a little bit , and i can read a lot --
you learnin ' anything at that school ?
i wan na go -- the trip do n't bother me none .
you had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow .
yes , sir ...
david lee ...
boy , you do n't make funny with your daddy like that .
he beat you , too , daddy , and you had a big ol ' shootin ' rifle .
you oughta be tired , too , sounder . that possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight !
yes , sir ...
yeah . we better git back to house now .
it was too dark , daddy .
if anybody 's to blame , it 's me -- i oughta nailed him when i took that shot .
here , put my jacket over you .
it 's cold , daddy !
looks that way , son . guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there 's one left out here -- we got ta find him .
there ai n't no possums in this woods tonight , daddy .
never heard of 'im . we got ta lotta men here ...
do you know my daddy , nathan lee morgan ?
sunday ...
when 's that ?
got ta wait 'til visitin ' days .
mister , can you visit anybody here ?
nathan lee morgan ...
what 's your daddy 's name ?
yes , ma'am ... ?
david !
see you tomorrow , miss boatwright .
will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to ?
yes , david ...
miss boatwright --
my father taught me ...
david , you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden .
thank you , josie mae .
naw , i 'm carryin ' it !
why do n't you try and git you a new dog ?
i guess i 'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be .
act like one !
i do n't look like no possum !
he will ... come on , git down and act like a possum .
then why do n't he holler like he usta ?
he eats all right -- his throat ai n't scarred .
sausage and hambones !
what 's in there , david ! ?
yes , ma 'm ...
be good and be smart , little boy .
he ca n't get up , mama !
what 's wrong , nathan ?
he wo n't go mad -- he 's just lookin ' for a cooler spot .
it 's when the heat is so bad , dogs go crazy .
it 's the heat .
what 's wrong with him , david ?
but who 's gon na help me here with the house and in the field ?
she says i can come live with her while school goin ' on , and come back home every time there ai n't no school .
how can you do that ? you do n't live anywhere near that school .
she is , mama ... when the fall comes , she wants me to come to her school .
miss johnson must be a real kindly lady .
so when i left , she gave me these books .
miss johnson is a teacher , and ...
who 's miss johnson ?
some books miss johnson gave me .
what 's that you carryin ' ?
i guess they musta sent 'im to another camp .
did n't see 'im , mama . the other men there say they did n't know daddy .
did you find your father ?
i cut it on some glass and we got lost , mama .
ask your daddy to give you some word about when he 'll be comin ' home -- and tell 'im we love him .
yes , mam ...
here 's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest , go into a church or railroad station -- but do n't go into nobody 's house , you hear me ?
i got to , mama . i know daddy wants to see him .
i wish you would n't take the dog with you , david -- he 's likely to be a burden to you .
good night ...
good night , mama ...
yes , son . you better get back to bed .
can i go day after tomorrow ?
no , i do n't and i ought n't not to after the way you 've taken over since they took him away -- and i would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im . the field 's all planted , so i guess i can spare you for a little while . when do you wanta leave ?
mama , do n't i always do what you say -- every time i go to the fields to plant the corn , to miss boatwright 's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and i do it , and you do n't worry .
but you 'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes , where will you sleep ? i ca n't send you away from here like that !
i can do it , mama -- you know that . in the bible stories you read to us , everybody 's always goin ' on a long journey . jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he do n't even know where he lives , but he finds him . everybody finds what they supposed to find .
so did i. i figured when the time got right , we could all take a day or two and walk up there , but it 's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone .
no , ma'am ... mama , i wanted mrs. boatwright to find out where daddy is , so me and sounder can go see him .
ca n't sleep ?
good ! but you do n't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it ! you 'll get that woman in trouble !
mama ! mama ! miss boatwright , say she gon ' help me find where daddy is !
he 'll be all right , mama . i 'll make him all right .
poor creature ...
listen , mama ...
what is it , david lee ?
i think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot . i do n't think he 's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself .
no mam -- i looked all over .
any sign of sounder ?
you sure can , son ...
can i go when the holiday comes ?
no , son . we havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway , they wo n't let womenfolk see their men no time .
did you see daddy ?
'bye , son -- i wo n't be gone long .
'bye , mama ...
david , come back here !
do n't take my daddy ! please do n't take my daddy !
children , come here ...
who is they ?
same as we -- they pray .
what do they do in the white churches , mama ?
nobody yet -- it 's all tied up .
who 's winning , mama ?
when you get outta that school , you come right on back home , y'all gon ' have to take this laundry work i done for miss boatwright today .
yes mam ...
you got two shirts on ?
tuck that shirt in , david lee .
ready to go , mama !
where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school .
where did it come from , mama ?
that 's right !
mama , there 's hot meat on the stove !
goodnight .
david lee , it 's time for you to get to bed !
hi , mrs. boatwright ... i 'm sorry 'bout the way i acted the other day , miss boatwright .
hello , david ...
i 'm used to it .
do n't pout now , david , it 's a long trip .
i 'll walk ...
come , i 'll take you home .
i do n't know a damn thing , now stop bothering me about it !
but , miss boatwright , you --
if i tell you i did n't , david , that 's what i mean .
but i saw you -- you looked in there , and you found out , miss boatwright .
no , he was wrong , david , i did n't find out .
you know where my father is , do n't you , miss boatwright ?
do n't mention this to anyone ! you hear me , david !
thank you , miss boatwright !
i 'll find out where your daddy is for you .
no , thank you -- i got ta go do some work in the field today .
would you like to have a cool drink , david ?
tell rebecca i said 'hi ' , now ...
yes mam ... we got ta go , miss boatwright.. .
when you read it we 'll talk about it ...
thank you , miss boatwright .
it 's about the three musketeers .
thank you , miss boatwright .
this is for your mama 's work , and here 's something for the three of you .
come in , children .
we brought your laundry , miss boatwright .
do n't belong to you ! it 's for the little important man , here !
well , let me have it .
seems this piece of mail came to mr. howard 's place this mornin ' and he had me to bring it over here .
whatcha got there ?
any time it 's saturday and i do n't hafta do any work , i 'm doin ' okay !
hi ya doin ' there , ike ?
he said , i do n't know , ike -- you doin ' better'n me , i been tryin ' to git in there for 200 years and ai n't make it yet !
what did the lord tell you , ike ?
i guess so -- but i went home and did me some praying to the lord . i said , lord , i went into this white church down in row and all i want you to tell me is how i ever got outta there in one piece .
they probly thought you was crazy .
you know , one time by mistake i went into a white church down in row county and to this day i do n't know how'n the devil i got outta that church alive .
and if they saw me pitch the way i did today -- they 'd hire me just to strike out babe ruth !
if they heard me sing like this up north i 'd be richer than the man i sharecrop for .
at the way you ask funny questions , josie mae !
mama , what was we laughin ' for ?
might be ...
is he gon ' be gone long ?
because he cared so damn much about you and me , child .
mama , why did they take daddy away ?
maybe soon --
mama , when kin me and earl go to school with david lee ?
do n't take all day at that table , david lee .
why do n't you pay him a visit , mr. howard ? he 'll tell you all about it .
somebody told me nathan was back . how is he ?
tired .
hi ya , rebecca ...
the season is a long way off , mr. howard , and by that time , nathan oughta be home . if he ai n't , believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops . we have to because we owe you all that money -- mr. howard .
dammit , i 'm talkin ' to you , woman ! i got ta farm to think about and i need answers .
i need some nutmeg , flour , eggs , sugar , and ...
whatcha wanta order ?
i did n't say nothin ' 'bout credit , mr. howard .
i hope it ai n't a lot , 'cause i ca n't give you no more credit till the croppin ' season gits back , that is if na --
i wanta get some things .
that 's one dollar an ' twenty cents .
i brought these walnuts to trade .
rebecca , you jest the one i wanta see .
do n't tell me nothin ' 'bout what we owe ol ' man howard ! i 'll do the owing , and let him worry 'bout the collecting ! come on , david lee !
but , nathan --

where you goin ' ! ?
it 's lunchtime , and i wan na have a talk with you , nathan lee . come on , children ...
i just got out here !
i see , all right -- it 's time for us to get out of this field .
there , you see ?
yeah , just stay where you is ...
is there something i can do to help you ?
this done happen before . it ai n't nothin ' -- i just have to wait a minute or two .
yeah . i feel real up to it right now . come on , david lee , you and me 'll do the loading .
you sure you feel up to it , nathan ?
well , let 's get to work !
did you tell 'im i was too busy for that kinda stuff ?
to invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree , drink ice cold whiskey , and just shoot the breeze !
what did he want ?
well , let 's get to it , miss rebecca , 'cause i been waitin ' too long a time for your good cookin ' !
the most important thing is that you 're home ! we was gon na have cold eatin ' tonight , 'cause of the heat , but now , i 'm goin ' to cook !
ike , you could make a song outta that !
if there ever was a devil in this county , ike , you is it !
hope it do n't freeze out our baseball game today !
little chilly .
how 's the weather out there ?
i 'll wait till after the children .
you ready to eat ?
mornin ' ...
good mornin ' , nathan .
what we make it to ? the next season to work ourselves to death , share croppin ' for ol ' man howard , so he can get richer and we ca n't even eat when the croppin ' time is done ?
we been through these off-seasons before -- we made it .
the boy is hungry , rebecca .
the boy done went into my walnuts ! i skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that 's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what i pick !
i shore could , miss rebecca .
i bet you could use a hot cup of coffee , nathan lee .
and do n't wake up josie mae and earl !
night , son !
is that a blessing , reverend ?
it 's not that simple , sister rebecca -- the lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin ' and we 'll leave it with nothing .
yeah , he 'll crawl into my bed tonight , lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley .

i 'll just try the first one .
wow !
`` found eight million pages with the word clitoris '' !
okay ...
wait ! before we put a message out , do a search on the word 'clitoris ' .
okay ... i just need to find a few private message boards ...
i agree ! the only way to save our future is to unite and fight ! < b > something must be done ! we must take action fast ! my parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past ! < /b >
i do n't know . but it has gone far enough ! i 'm sick of it ! < b > something must be done ! change has got to come around ! they 're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground ! ca n't you see what this is leading to ? a world of chains and ties and glue ! we have to fight before they 've taken every one ! something must be done ! < /b >
what has the world come to ? this is horrible . we 're locked up , burning books , hating other people-
it 's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too !
is n't that in arizona or something ?
all it says is that it 's above the vulva ... but where the hell is the vulva ?

yeah , they suck .
i 'm so sick of these soldiers .

good thing she was never your girlfriend ... dude , here comes cartman .
i bet she would if my name was gregory ! !
wow , dude . wendy could really give a rats ass about you .
she 's not ! but if she was it would be that little asshole who 's fucking it up for me !
i thought she was n't your girlfriend , dude .
that british dickhole is what 's taking wendy away from me !
i do n't know , dude .
what ? what do n't i get ? what do n't i get ?
how do we do that ?

you bastards ! !
oh my god ! they killed kenny !
you bastard ! !
oh my god ! ! you killed kenny ! !
yeah ...
dude , anybody who does n't think terrance and phillip is funny can fuck off anyways .
yeah !
i 've heard them from mr. garrison a few times before ...
nowhere .
yeah , let 's swear we wo n't tell !
now remember , do n't tell anybody we saw the terrance and phillip movie !
she 's not my girlfriend , dude !
woa , dude , who 's your girlfriend 's new guy ?
aw , god damn it , he 's singing that fucking song again .
< b > thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i 'd ever hoped for knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think i 'd die for ... < /b >
where do they come up with this stuff ? !
that was sweet !
we have to see this movie , dude !
this is terrible ! this ca n't be happening ! !
kyle , check it out .
hey , dudes ... are n't you supposed to go to church , kenny ?
-or monkey fucker-
shiteater-
we 're going to find our boys ! for god 's sake sheila , you almost had them killed ! !
where are you going ? ! we need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals !
wake up , people ! we all have to do things that are n't pretty sometimes ! it 's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for ! why do you think children have to be born in hospitals ?
oh lord , what have we done ... ?
yes ! and i will not allow my children to be ruined by smut ! ! i am sorry young man , but i have had it up to here ! strap them in !
sheila , you 're going to far ! those are your children !
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie . it was terrance and phillip ... they killed kenny .
i knew this would happen ! those bastard canadians have now killed a child ! ca n't people see the damage that film is doing ? !
what is 'fisting ' ?
oh dear god ...
right away , ma'am !
i 'm needing lunch .
yes ?
and bill ?
yes ma'am !
well find out where that signal is coming from ! then hunt them down like dogs ! any and all canadian influence must be stopped at all cost !
ma'am , we 're tracking a resistance ... it 's probably canadian spies ! !
not necessary ? ! mr. president , may i remind you that our country 's heart and soul are at stake , and our children 's minds are the battlefield ! the bastard canadians want to fight us because we wo n't tolerate their potty mouths . well , if it is war they want ... then war they shall have ! ! !
oh , uh ... i do n't know if air strikes are necessary .
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers . it 's the only way to ensure that their smut ca n't reach american soil !
huh ?
what about air strikes ?
as commander in chief , i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack .
my fellow americans . i have led this fight in the war against profanity . i have founded mothers against canada . our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time .
oh god ... what have i done ...
silence ! ! ! now ! ! ! everyone bow down to me ! ! !
and i thought my mother was the master of guilt . geez louise .
yes ... and in doing so , you brought enough anger and intolerance to the world to allow my coming .
you have spilled the blood of the innocents . now the world belongs to me ... now begins two million years of darkness ! ! and all thanks to you ! ! !
oh .
silence ! i am satan !
oh no you do n't ! this is my fight ! ! i do n't need your help , alan dershwitz !
i am the dark master !
what the hell is going on ? !
you 're all part of satan 's army now !
you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school !
but i-
yes principal victoria . the pta is impeaching you .
article 42 ! you do n't mean- ? !
forgive me for saying so , principal victoria , but your methods are too ... shall we say ... soft ? as head of the pta , i am exercising my right under article 42 of the pta code .
ooh yes . i think we 'll have to give detention to those boys .
we must take action on this immediately .
well , it looks like i 'll have to send a warning letter out to parents . i have to put a stop to this before more children see 'terrance and phillip ' .
terrance and phillip are two very untalented , unfunny actors from canada . their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage . now it appears they have a movie and i 'm positive it 's not suitable for children !
what is terrance and phillip ?
terrance and phillip movie ? ! oy gevalt ! not again !
no , worse . here 's a short list of the things they 've been saying .
the f word ? !
no , it was worse than that ...
what did my son say , principal victoria ? did he say the s word ?
alright , i 'll make the call ...
i do n't care if it 's dangerous ! desperate times call for desperate measures , mr. mackey . perhaps i need to remind you of your situation .
mrs. brovlofski , the v-chip has n't been fully tested yet , it could be dangerous .
then we 'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization .
well , some of the children just do n't respond to 12 step programs .
what do you mean most , why not all ?
very encouraging . most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths .
how is the children 's progress ?
this is not a place for fun and games ! this is rehabilitation ! now get to it ! ! we at mac have a trial to go to !
uh , we 're just , starting our program ...
indeedy , that was a delicious choice of words !
you 're quite a purveyor of filth , little boy !
terrance ! no !
agh !
you did ? just now ?
did you hear that , terrance ? i farted !
canada is saving us ! !
what 's going on terrance ?
i know , terrance . i know .
phillip , this is worse than that trip to quebec city when i fell asleep in that disco .
i know , terrance . this is quite the shitstorm we 've found ourselves in this time .
oh , phillip . this can not be good .
you would know , dummy .
oh , you are such a maroon !
yeah , god , no wonder your country is so fucked up .
the problem is you do n't allow your children to think for themselves . you try to raise them in a protective bubble , and then when they finally get old enough , they realize they 've been lied to , and they resent you for it .
do n't believe the hype ! !
the young boy that died lit himself on fire . it was unfortunate , but how can they blame us ?
fight the power !
and you call yourself a canadian ! i told you we should of done leno !
this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us ! you are a bad man !
phillip , we 've been tricked and ambushed by the conan o'brian show ! !
cheers , terrance !
good one , phillip ! cheers .
hello , brooke shields !
hello , conan !
i sure did , phillip ! !
ha ha ha ! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart ! ha ha ha ! !
you bet , terrance !
say phillip , want to see the northern lights ?
i did , terrance , i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face !
well , terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience .
< b > shut your fucking face ! ! unclefucka ! ! ! you 're the one that fucked your uncle , unclefucka ! ! ! you do n't eat , or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long ! < /b >

you 'd fuck your uncle !
you 'd fuck your uncle !
it says 'dear terrance , please do n't ever tell my son that i licked your hairy balls . '
my mother sent you a letter ? what 's it say ?
it 's from your mother .
a letter from who , you shit sucking cock master ?
well , fuck my ass and call me a bitch , i just got a letter !
oh yeah !
well , let 's see ... first of all , you fuck pigs .

ow , you 're hurting me !
i do n't care ! i want to talk about it now !

they 're not going to make it !
jesus , come on !
anna ...
anna ...
oh sara ...
oh yeah ...
oh yeah ...
oh warren ... oh warren ... take me , god take me ...
well get used to it , 'cause here we are , on the cruise of a lifetime .
i never though i 'd be stuck in a wine closet with warren wayne .
well is n't that great . something to write home about .
i think we 're moving .
yeah , well ... i forgot my morphine back in the room .
getting drunk is no solution .
i 'll tell you what i 'm going to do .
will you two please stop it ! i do n't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch !
he 's shutting off the air ! ! !
oh my god , what is he doing ?
very professional of you .
no , i think hygiene is important . it helps you get into the part .
i 'm sure i will .
well , it was nice meeting you . enjoy the rest of the trip .
it certainly is .
well , so we are . sure is beautiful , huh ?
well i guess we 're neighbors for this trip .
so ...
of course , of course ...
well a little business too . in my upcoming project star trackers i play a ship 's captain , and i really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience . i feel it will add more credibility to my performance .
so , what brings you out here ? pleasure cruise ?
well i appreciate that .
magnificent , magnificent .
oh , thank you .
my grandfather . my god , i ca n't tell you what a fan i am of yours ! you were magnificent in deadly gamble .
koros , as in ... koros ? dimitri koros ?
anna koros . she sensually extends her hand , warren shakes it -
uh , yes i am . and you are ?
you 're warren wayne .
excuse me ?
it ca n't be .
evening .
and i intend to correct that at once . i 'll tell you something mac ...
there is a high level ... of passenger dissatisfaction .
i hear you mac and i appreciate it . frankly i do n't know what i 'd have done without you on this one .
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
my ... wings ...
mac , you really earned your wings this flight .
the device has stopped responding .
on channel 10 ?
well you did the right thing mac .
i am here to provide service to ... to all our guests . there is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction . it is my duty ... to report this .
were you going to give it to them ?
they are awaiting further information .
and what are they doing now , mac ?
i did nothing to the monitors .
you did n't do anything to the monitors , did you mac ?
yes he did . yes he did . barnes looks at the monitor - taylor and the others are still in the dining room -
oh he did , did he ?
i was there . officer taylor accessed my cpu directly to open the airlock doors . they are not functioning properly .
were n't you down in the dining room ?
hello second mate barnes . i was instructed to come to the bridge .
where the hell did you come from ?
well shut it off at once !
all too well , captain .
look answer my question !
it 's a little late for you to be up .
what did you say to me ?
ai n't it the truth . must be good to be rich .
well , i guess she figures she 's paying for it .
why should she , it 's her fault . all guests are told not to eat in zero gravity , but she just wanted to have fun i guess , did n't realize what a grain of salt can do to sophisticated machinery .
good help is hard to find ...
idiot ...
look you said it does n't matter to you anyway ! why do you want to kill more innocent people ! why !
i told you not to try anything smart ! i guess you 're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order ! and that 's just too bad for all of you now , is n't it ?
look we gave you what you asked for . it checks out did n't it ? ! what more do you want from us !
sure you do . sending mac out on a little recon work . how pathetic . problem is it seems mac blew a few fuses . or maybe he 's just a little drunk . were you partying with a robot taylor ?
i do n't know what you 're talking about !
taylor , you surprise me .
mac , can you hear me ? come in ?
will you transmit the distress signal ?
that was a joke taylor , lighten up ! why do n't you just hold them up to the lens . i 'll write them down , and once i 'm through verifying them , i 'll get back to you .
well , preferably in tens and twenties ...
we have the codes here . how do you want to receive them ?
uh , that 's an affirmative , roger wilco . please proceed .
who said i 'll re-enter in the pod ? i got friends out in space , ryan , friends willing to get me back unnoticed . thank god for deregulation huh ?
it 's still not going to work ! they 'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel !
i 'd advise you to shut up and let me finish taylor . you need n't worry about the lifepods because they 're all gone , jettisoned . save for one .
then we 've got to get to the lifepods !
ok , i will . the bad news is the ship is history . life support will last another 36 hours , maybe .
you better start making sense !
now do you want the good news first or the bad news ?
yes i can transmit the code 3 emergency ! i just do n't think it 's a prudent move at this juncture .
what are you talking about ! can you transmit the code 3 -
much as i 'd like to help you and our valued guests , i 'm afraid i ca n't .
transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline . override the airlock sensors and hurry ! we 're running out of time , we have to get to the pods !
the bridge is fine , taylor , how are things down there ?
what is the condition of the bridge ?
why yes ryan , i am , and thanks for asking . you do n't have to talk to the intercom , i can hear you fine .
barnes , can you hear me , are you all right ?
that 's very professional sounding of you , taylor .
if anyone can hear me please respond !
yeah yeah yeah , give me a minute here .
bridge ! can anyone hear me ? !
i can hardly wait .
well , maybe i 'll surprise you .
no . i 'm all set . thanks .
well , maybe i will . you sure you do n't want anything ?
i think i can handle it .
uh ...
what , and leave you here all by your lonesome ?
nah , i already ate . why do n't you just go down there ?
man , i 'm hungry . i 'm going to call the steward , you want anything ? .
thank you .
that 's very pragmatic of you , barnes .
you got ta think of your old age .
it 's steady , good benefits .
you want to go back to shuttle work ?
well that hotel begins construction in january , there 's going to be a lot of shuttle work .
why , did n't they say ?
i do n't know . everything 's up in the air at this point , no pun intended .
so , are you on for the next one ?
ai n't it the truth . the two say nothing for a beat -
well , everything 's running smoother than a baby 's ass .
all right , i 'll give it a shot .
trust me . even checked 'em with my own eyes .
you 're certain of that ?
why do n't you reset and run it again . the pods check out ok .
yes i 'm sure i hit the right commands .
there must be some mistake . you sure you hit the right commands ?
it 's telling me fail mode confirmed . did you see this ?
well it 's a good thing that i did .
no , i just ran it ! why are you running it again ?
sounds like you 've been talking to mac too much .
well i guess there 's no time like the present . i 'll go run a check on that room , just to show we go that extra mile for our guests .
over and out !
sheesh ! aye aye cap'n !
good . now you 'll hear from me when i have the new coordinates . in the meantime do n't bug me .
that 's clear .
is that clear ?
this is a major screw up on your part , goddamn it !
now i got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod ! you 're just gon na have to pick me up later .
let 's get something straight , chappy !
goddamn it barnes this really steams my onions !
i told you , i had to teach a few people a lesson !
well if you knew it then why did set your thrusters on before making the calculation ?
do n't worry about me , i 'm changing coordinates now . i 've come to far to be tripped up by some dudley do-right ... motherfuckers !
well blaze your ass out of there ! you 've completely altered your trajectory , are we linking up or not ? !
this ship is going down in a blaze of glory !
the others decided to get cute with me , so i 'm teaching them a lesson !
you 're not helping my heart condition any , barnes ! now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for ?
damage control ! what kind of damage ? what 's going on barnes !
cool your jets ... i 'm doing a little damage control .
so , what are we waiting for ?
i know , i know .
it 's time we lock coordinates .
10-4 good buddy .
oh you 'll get it , believe me . so i 'll see you in a few .
well that 's your call . does n't make a damn bit of difference to me . just as long as i get my cut .
i do n't know . i really have n't made up my mind yet . we 'll see how nicely they behave .
will do . what about the distress signal ?
yeah , i know bill , i came up with the plan remember ? just have those hangar doors open and ready , i can take it from there .
well do n't drag your ass . there wo n't be much of a window for us to link up . we 'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours .
seems like they 're cooperating . hopefully i 'll be out of here and on my way very soon .
break it down to me , what 's going on ?
that 's me .
barnes ?
just do n't move around too much .
it 's getting hard to breathe ...
will you shut up already ?
we 're going to die .
do n't say that ! it ai n't over till it 's over !
what 's the use ... we 're gon na die ...
i do n't have a problem with it . besides , you get to meet a lot of interesting people .
well , more power to you . me , i start to bug out after too much time out here .
not me . i 'm in for the long haul . in nine months i 'll have enough to take a few years off .
well ... i do n't mind . i can put up with it . i 'm taking six months off after this , and i wo n't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me .
like that piece of ass he was with .
no . but it buys a lot of other things .
yeah , i guess money do n't buy class .
look at this ... jesus .
i do n't know . wave to them !
what is it ? !
try not to think about it .
right now it 's about 8 o'clock at home . people are going to work , kids are going to school ...
good . in that case , i pronounce us man and wife .
in that case , i accept .
it would matter to us .
i would , but no one can perform the ceremony . i guess it does n't matter .
that 's right . will you marry me ?
marry you ?
will you marry me ?
except write our wills .
it did . it is . there 's nothing we can do about that .
i never thought this would happen . no premonitions , nothing .
and so far .
so close ...
we do n't have time . i 'll explain later , hurry !
what do you mean ? what happened !
we have room ! let 's go !
what the hell are you doing ?
over and out .
sooner than later .
hopefully sooner than later .
thanks for everything , taylor . will i see you again ?
i 'm staying with the ship . i 'll be all right . now hurry .
so what 's going to happen to you ?
i 'll do my best .
uh , it 's ok , everything 's going to be ok ... now i 'm counting on you , and whatever you do keep calm , we do n't want them to panic .
how does the distress signal look ?
hurry . you have to get them out of there !
i 'm about to blow the wall .
he 's out of the equation . talk to me .
barnes ?
i 'm in the bridge .
taylor ! where are you ?
dawn . come in .
you too .
i will once i get past the bulkhead . good luck .
i ca n't !
but you ca n't be sure ! it 's suicide . you have to come with us !
do n't worry about me . there 's still a chance i can issue a distress signal .
but how are you going to escape ?
i 'm going to try and buy you some time . i can get to the bridge from here .
and what are you going to do ? !
there 's only room on that pod for seven . that 's you and the others . i 'm counting on you to get them out of there .
what ? what are you talking about ?
i 'm not going with you .
why ? where are you going ?
a little dab 'll do ya . now you know how to get there , right ?
no ...
a flare ? a flare wo n't do it .
take this flare .
that 's why we need a safe passage . remember what you said earlier , about getting through the wall ? that might just be our ticket .
we do n't have enough suits to get the others out .
a schematic of the ship . looking for a lifeline to the pods .
what 's that ?
the room is filled with poison gas . the hydraulic system must have blown .
oh my god . what happened ?
it was no time to lose my partner . we 're going to have to hurry , he 's on to us .
i guess i owe you a debt of gratitude . you saved my life .
helllp !
dawn ! dawn !
words to live by .
do n't worry about what will happen , just concentrate on what is happening . you 'll live longer .
sure .
do you want some advice ?
yeah , but you did n't answer my question .
well , dawn , i 'm an optimist by nature .
what do you think 's going to happen to us ?
yeah ?
taylor ?
one of barnes ' duds , luckily for us . take this out of the equation right now ...
explosive ?
do n't worry about me . where are we going ?
be careful , you do n't want to puncture the suit .
at this point i 'm ready for anything .
you 're ready for the real thing ?
so we did .
yeah . we did it .
ready as i 'll ever be .
are you ready ?
i understand .
i do n't know what we 're facing .
simulated space walking .
look i know what i 'm doing . i have experience and training in space walking .
i ca n't let you do that .
wait .
everyone just stay put .
even if we do , it might be too late .
if i could get to the bridge i could send the distress signal .
yeah , let 's hope he can find a way through .
it must be oxygenated if we can hear him .
close every door behind you !
he certainly is polite .
you 're right .
we could send mac . if he can retrieve one suit , we could go back for the other .
suppose you did n't have to hold your breath ?
and suppose you could n't hold out ?
i do n't know the condition of the compartments . depending on damage , debris ... could be a fatal mistake .
why ca n't we ?
damn it . if only we could get to those suits ... dawn then thinks of something -
great .
sure . it complies with all standard construction codes .
seen one like it before ?
ok ... it 's open .
with what ? how am i going to interface with it ? i need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me .
ca n't we access the mainframe to check the ship 's condition ?
it depends on the condition of the ship . if i could get to one of the suit compartments i could check the exterior air locks for a possible entry .
supposing we could get out of this room ? is there anything we could do to reach the bridge ?
just considering our options ... sir .
i do n't think you know what you 're talking about . besides , what could we use for tools ? a steak knife ? a corkscrew ?
well maybe we can do something like that .
probably come through the wall i suppose .
given a malfunction , how would a rescue team get you out if the doors wo n't open ?
fat chance of that . even if we had c4 and a laser torch these doors would n't budge . that son of a bitch ... that stupid son of a bitch .
well maybe there 's a way out of here .
we do n't .
i do n't know .
what are we going to do ?
still , i hope i behave on the moon . i 'll stick close to you .
really ?
actually i 've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute , mostly related to starship construction .
i 'm sure you 'll be all right .
well i hope i do n't do anything careless .
well i do n't think there 's a chance of that happening . it 's usually the moon walks . sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher .
like open an airlock by mistake ?
well , let me put it this way . most of the cost is due to safety reasons . most people are not familiar with space travel , so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless .
well , plus the money ai n't that bad . dawn so , tell me , do you think everyone gets their million dollars ' worth on this trip of a lifetime ?
so you were looking for a new challenge .
this is my second commercial flight . i used to run satellite freighters but that got old fast .
yes . theoretical discoveries aside , there 's nothing like the real thing . how about you ?
ryan taylor , first mate . welcome aboard . first time in space ?
that 's right .
oh right , right you 're on that research grant .
that is one of my priorities .
yes mac , but the guests are requesting it . it will reduce the level of negative feedback .
well if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room , and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar .
so i 've been told .
well , there 's no better to way to see the world , than with us .
no , just enjoying the view .
is there anything i can help you with ?
thank you .
congratulations on your ... recent award .
i 'm fine .
are you nuts ! it 's too risky !
i 'm going back for taylor !
he 's in the bathroom .
carlo !
he 's up on the bridge ! he 's going to be ok. now who 's missing ?
where 's taylor ?
there 's no time to explain . get everyone together ! we found a way to the pods !
what is happening around here ! ! !
how can you sit there with your fat stomach and tell me to take it easy ! i want to go home ! i want to be warm ! i want to get out of here !
baby , take it easy .
it 's getting too cold in here . i ca n't stand this anymore !
talk to him ... jesus ...
you 're delbert miles ! you have more clout than some whacked out pilot ! talk to him !
how am i supposed to know ?
well now what are we gon na do !
send it back if you do n't want it .
oh no ... i think there 's carrots in here ...
besides i ca n't wait to tee off on the sea of tranquillity . that should shore up that prick hank drexler .
i guess so .
look around you baby , we 're rubbing elbows with royalty , oil sheiks , this is class . you 'll be envied by everyone .
look you were the one who wanted to do something different , something to tell all your friends . any chump can go to nassau .
how is it going to be different from this ? go see some boring footprint under glass ?
ah hell we can always do that . listen believe me , once we get to the moon , your tone is going to change .
we should have gone to nassau . at least we could go swimming , lie on the beach .
homesick ? it 's only been two days !
i 'm homesick .
the engines !
what the hell is that ?
what makes you so sure ?
because , taylor would n't do that , that 's why .
i tell you , something 's not right here . how do we know they 're not going to use the pod for themselves ?
what are you going to do about it ?
again with the orders from you ! you got a napoleon complex chief , and i 'm getting sick of it !
i 'll tell you what you 're gon na do . you 're gon na stay put like taylor said .
i have n't quite made up my mind yet .
who are you calling a pig , rummy ?
you 're gon na give him those bank codes , you know why ? because i 'm telling you to , that 's why . i 'm not losing my life over some greedy pig .
well what would you know about it ? you do n't have anything to lose .
look . we 're talking about life and death here . i do n't know why we 're even having this conversation .
that 's affirmative .
is it safe for human transport ?
i would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector .
how is it looking , mac ?
certainly . anything i can do to be of service .
ok mac ... i 'll talk to you on this . i want to find a way to get to the bridge , then i want you to come back .
i 'm sorry . the suit compartments are in a non-oxygenated , zero gravity atmosphere . i 'm afraid that 's off limits to all passengers .
mac , what about the suit compartments on this level ? can they be accessed ?
yes . you can enjoy some wonderful views from there .
but the corridor outside this door is open , correct ?
one moment please ... one moment please ...
now mac , can you tell me the status of this deck ?
i know but we 're in a bind .
alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer .
yeah but the ship 's mainframe does n't . i need you to tell it something .
that will not be necessary . you can simply speak to me . i understand most languages fluently .
i need you to actually do something for me . i need to access your cpu , directly .
right , i understand that ...
certainly . i have a full working knowledge of the ships operations .
yes i know all that . mac , i need you to help us out with a little technical problem .
certainly . if you need anything , please feel free to ask me . just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
mac , i have a favor to ask you . mac looks at taylor -
mac . what 's shaking ?
officer taylor , how are you this evening ?
just like junior did the last time ; lane six . all 's i know is it 's gon na be a closed coffin . my advice to you is to lay low . he puts on a pair of dark 7-eleven shades , flips up his collar and skulks away .
the pin machine ?
did you hear about that bowler who got smeared ? i saw them pull a body bag out of the alley . i heard he was kacked but good . they had to take apart the pin machine to get him out .
maybe i should have left the ball in the car .
my father used to say to me `` never ... '' no , hmmm . `` always ... '' no , no ... ah ! love and hate are blood relations .
yeah , but it did n't go so good . he was n't the man i thought he 'd be . theo is trying to affix the lid on his cup , but his hands are trembling , spilling some of the coffee .
find your bowler ?
99 years , 241 days , 15 hours , and 20 minutes of no bowling . alfie shuffles up to the self-serve island and begins wiping it down .
a bowler .
what kind of man ?
i 'm looking for a man .
i 'm from akron .
you 're not from around here , are you ?
i 'm an addict . i ca n't go through a day without the stuff . theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand .
no . i 'm from akron .
orange who ? not from 'round here , are ya ?
you have orange whips ?
can i get you something for the road ?
paradise , huh ? might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. theo turns to leave .
nope .
you a mini-golfer ?
it 's splitsville for you .
you tried to make it look like junior trashed his place . junior 's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in .
after we id , we bury the body . case and casket closed .
i should 've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one .
sorry about your loss .
you said it would be unethical to help me . you call dwarf bowling ethical !
heh , heh , heh .
he 's my dad .
hey , cut it out sid , that tickles . i 'm serious ! you guys are related , right ?
look sid , a buzz burger . the faz 's favorite lunch . sid reaches for the plate . buzz walks over to the booth and pulls his burger away from sid .
i do n't know no buzz fazeli .
it belonged to my dad .
have n't seen a ball like that since '69 .
whoa , cool your maples . over the bridge , past the peter pan , last house on the dead end . theo releases sid 's hand . sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand .
where can i find buzz fazeli ?
see ya 'round faz .
nectar of the bowling gods , faz .
the faz sure took care a her . breeze makes a nasal grunt as he tries to suppress a snigger . sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him . sid and breeze approach the coffin . breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid .
i 'd buy it !
think he bought it ?
only problem is , you did n't put his lights out , you just got him mad . then he took it out on poor faz , god rest his soul . theo patches out .
she told us you went after junior to save your old man 's hide . you got some balls goin ' after that psycho .
kastle 's daughter 's been lookin ' for you .
did you know you were parked in the handicap space ?
nothing going on here , everybody stand back . let him through , ladies . ladies , please . as they start to move through the female throng , a little girl pops out in front of them , holding her ball .
bowling police , step back , give him room .
is it true they blacked out the whole county giving you electro-shock ? junior looks from one man to the other , breathing heavily , his nostrils flaring .
hello mr. kastle . junior , long time . i thought they locked you up and threw away the warden !
wait ! that 's an aria !
how do you turn this thing off ?
right , eating at the core , eating it 's way out . it makes me sick !
- canker sore .
but not no more . now people take advantage . bowling ai n't what it used to be . there 's something evil spreading in this sport - like a big , gigantic , puss- ridden -
sure , sid .
gambling . and it was a safe place for kids , a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome , clean fun .
bowling was the most incorruptible sport . no megalomillionaires , no
no kiddin ' .
you know , elvis bowled .
it was a clearance .
you got an 8-track tape player on purpose , just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin ' opera .
you listen to the feelings , not the words .
how do you know , you do n't even speak latin ?
how could you hate opera , sid ? opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music !
i hate fuckin ' opera .
la da da dalala ...
bowling used to be so pure , so ... all- american . breeze sings along with caruso and pretends to conduct .
so buzz , let 's skedaddle . mr. kastle is waiting . as buzz gets up , theo rises and steps between his father and the two sleazeballs .
your pop said to put these on his tab . sid gets up and jerks his thumb towards the door .
pinhead ! do n't just blurt it right out .
i remember , sid ! mr. kastle says he do n't like no sticky fingers in the till .
look , faz , mr. kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you ... what was that he said ... ?
are you guys bruddas ?
buzz , mr. kastle wants to talk to you .
we 're looking for buzz fazeli , seen him ?
hey , you still here ?
when you get a chance .
three whips . to go .
you afraid we 're gon na steal it ?
ah , come on , lem me see your ball .
lem me see your ball .
yeah , basement bingo .
what do you want with old man faz ?
fazeli ... i do n't know no buzz fazeli .
no , pinhead , he ai n't here to bowl .
hey , ai n't i seen you on the tour ?
oh , a professional man . what 'll you have ?
theo 's bowled on the tour .
you look like you 're something on the lanes .
sheila , meet ... uh ... i forget the name .
buzz burger , side of 'cues . you have n't introduced me to your fan .
some people will do anything for an autograph . theo enters the diner and walks over to buzz .
you do n't need coffee , mr. fazeli ; you need a vacation . sheila catches sight of theo pulling into the parking lot . she puts a ken head earring in her right ear . buzz follows sheila 's gaze .
yeah , and make it extra muddy , i did n't sleep a zee last night . sheila fills a cup . buzz lifts it to his mouth , his hands trembling .
wish me luck .
i 'm sure you have buzz .
miles , i 've always been on the square with you .
simple math , buzz . two plus two does not equal three .
and look at that ; both partners go down together . kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor , stands up , and crushes it under his heel . he goes over and puts his arm around buzz .
a beautiful thing . and you know why buzz ? you know what we got ? buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt .
it 's a beautiful thing .
brainstorm , buzz . i admit , i thought it was a rotten idea , but i put up the scratch . and now we got a beautiful thing .
this scam we got going here was your
seven years .
we 've been partners a long time now , have n't we buzz ?
what 's on your mind , miles ?
see ya 'round maynard .
you give ed klein of the american bowling congress a call . tell him your maynard 's boy . he 's expecting you , and he owes me . he 'll getcha back in like flynn . do n't say i never gave you nothing .
i did n't mean that stuff i said . i was trying to keep you out of this muddle . i 'm glad i did n't have my tubes tied . oh , and by the way , i made a call for you before i - uh - retired . buzz takes his card and scrawl on the back with a gold pen .
listen , if straight does n't work out , you come work for me . just make sure nobody 's following you . buzz 's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset , his halo bouncing in the breeze .
i 'm goin ' straight . no more short cuts . theo gets into the car . buzz leans in the open window .
thanks , kid . where are you goin ' now ?
i never saw you .
so , eh , you never saw me . right ?
you 're a scumbag .
bowling died for me years ago . besides , i 'm a living dead legend . i 'm a hero .
what about bowling ?
i told you to get lost . you forced yourself into this mess , so the mess accommodated you . buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo .
it could just as easily have been me in that box .
i am underground .
the whole world thinks you 're underground .
he says that to all his wives .
we ai n't married no more .
i could n't care less .
look , kid , gim me a break . i 'm an old man . i 'm runnin ' on a delrin aorta . i 'm finished - dead from my ankles up .
i was beaten on a shot named after my own dad . the moment passes . theo turns and climbs into his car . he looks up at buzz .
you never even took the shot . you could n't do it . theo moves towards buzz in a threatening manner .
that 's right , buzz , and you know when i did it ? last match , last frame . all i needed was one spare for the crown - and i get stuck with the seven-ten , the fazeli split .
not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television .
i did n't think so .
no ...
you got a better offer ?
he 'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life .
i got ta survive .
did that porcupine say he 'd get you back on the tour ?
i 'm getting to like it here .
theo , i want you to get out of this town .
you 're dead without the pro-tour , and you know it . get him away from me . sid and breeze punch theo in the face .
i do n't need the stinking pro-tour .
that 's a laugh . you 're all strung out . you 're a bowling junkie .
fuck you and fuck bowling .
i had a career . she wanted a little bowler of her own . sid and breeze leap into the fray , prying the two men apart . they wrestle theo against a wall , pressing his face into the tiles .
do n't say that about my mom !
what makes you so sure it was me ? she coulda had lotsa bowlers ! theo rushes buzz and grabs his arm . the two men struggle for the pin .
you wish !
i 'm your blood .
i 'm more of a bowler than you 'll ever be . i deal with my own shit . i ai n't asking anyone to bail me out .
you have no right to call yourself a bowler . buzz slaps theo in the face .
i do what i got ta do to survive .
it looks like dwarf bowling .
what 's it look like to you ?
what the fuck is this ?
maybe i could bowl in japan .
if the japanese are pansies , then pansies are my kind of people . sheila steps over to the booth with their food . the buzz burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball . buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner .
not for me . miniature golf 's for pansies .
it 's gon na be bigger than big . think europe . think asia . they do n't have room for real golf courses in japan .
the small ball .
it 's the next level , the next dimension ... ... the small ball .
putt-putt golf ?
kissed a lotta tadpoles . listen , i been thinking about your problem . i 'm not the guy to sponsor you . it would be unethical . but , there is something i could do for you . putt-putt golf .
watch out for that one . she 's got a great average , but she 's looking for a prince . and , believe me , she 's
theo ! this is sheila kastle , my partner 's daughter .
theo .
i could n't pay someone enough to try to kill me . sheila comes over to take their orders .
she thinks someone 's trying to kill you .
you should n't listen to her , she 's a nervous old nellie .
what are you doing over at the lanes that 's so dangerous , buzz ?
you know what a mixer ball is ? it 's like you , you come out of nowhere and upset things , scattering everything all over . buzz grumpily waves at him to sit .
millie left to stay with her sister in ronkonkoma .
i ai n't nobody 's father !
i got a right . you 're my father .
you 're a bullshit artist , that 's what you are . you got no right to be here ! theo yanks the trophy away from buzz .
you knew her . you married her in 1963 .
i do n't know no grace skinner .
i 'm your son . you 're a hard father to find .
who are you ? who sent you here ?
she 's my mom .
grace skinner . who 's grace skinner to you ?
grace skinner .
who gave it to you ?
it 's mine .
where 'd you get this ball ?
thanks .
orange whip , nectar of the bowling gods . thanks sweetie . millie turns the tray so that buzz takes the untainted whip . theo takes the other glass .
my mom was there . she told me about it . the 'fazeli split . '
that game was before you was born .
ten thousand to one , but you pegged it . the toughest shot on the last frame .
yeah , against that prick vandemark .
remember the finals in akron in '59 ? you had a seven-ten split in the final frame .
i 've never had orange whips , i 'm from akron .
sure , around here , any fat old bald guy could be king . i 'm nothing . it would n't do any good for me to talk to the congress . hey , you thirsty ? you like orange whips ?
i need a sponsor to get my sanction card back . where i come from , you 're the king .
what do you think i can do ?
i can appeal in five . i was hoping you could help me mr. fazeli .
100 years !
they suspended me for 100 years .
i got suspended when i was young , too . i was pretty cocky in my day .
do n't worry about the congress , they 're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies .
well , mr. fazeli , the bowling congress says i 'm a thorn in their side .
need some advice , huh .
i 'm not on the tour this year .
i know your face , you 're an up-and-comer . you bowl on the tour .
theo .
buzz fazeli .
you see what you did ? take your ball and get out .
my poor baby !
millie , please . i do n't have a son . i think you better leave now young man . buzz gestures towards the front door .
son ?
we should leave this town . i ca n't take this anymore . i 'm not gon na let him kill you in my house .
millie , i know what i 'm doing .
you 're in trouble , are n't you buzz ? you 're doing something dangerous in that alley .
bowlers do n't go around killing other bowlers . he 's only a fan , millie . i 'll give him some tips and an autograph and he 's outta here .
i looked in his car . he 's got pictures of you , clippings , maps .
he 's not the guy , millie . just whip the whips .
he 's the guy buzz .
clam it !
oh sure . let everyone in . from now on i leave the door wide open . let the parade begin !
i got ta go . love ya mom .
you sure you 're ok teddy ? you 're not bowling are you ?
mom , you know i had to do it . i just did it a little too late .
he 's dead , is n't he . buzz fazeli might just as well have died before you were born .
i found dad .
theodore ? where are you ? are you alright ?
hello , mom ?
hello ?
i 'll tell you one thing , you wo n't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose . stay away from his ass - and do n't play any of his fuckin ' knock-knock jokes .
uh ... over easy .
i was doing the lambada with her and the guy freaks , he breaks my arm , tries to kill me . i swear man , the guy thought i was a piata . if nobody else had n't a been there , he would n't have stopped . he woulda killed me . fuckin ' guy man , just snapped . how do you like your burger ?
how 's that ?
hey man , welcome to our parking lot . lem me give you some advice , if she asks you to dance , make sure her brother 's not around . somebody blew out junior 's pilot light , if you get my meaning .
theo . howzitgoin .
cool !
do n't tell me , john .
i do n't want to play .
you played bouncy-bouncy with sheila , so i 'm gon na play blue-face with you .
what did you do to buzz ?
he told me to play blue-face with buzz . i like games .
what did your dad tell you to do to buzz ? theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees . junior catches him , grabbing his ankles .
nobody touches her . except me . i touch her . sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her .
no , junior , you should n't touch her .
you should n't touch her .
junior ! you 're supposed to say junior who ! i 'm going to have to hurt you . theo and junior circle one another .
who 's there ?
no . i say knock-knock ! you say who 's there . i say who 's there and then you say who who . you 're not playing right . knock-knock .
buzz fazeli .
who 's there !
who 's there ?
knock-knock .
it feels good to let it out , does n't it ? sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father .
it depends .
you 're prone to violent outbursts , are n't you ?
i do n't like to talk about it .
j'you-and-your-friend do it yet ?
junior who ?
junior .
who 's there ?
come on sheila , knock-knock .
do you have to get your hooks into every guy i 'm interested in ?
it 's not so bad . when i 'm alone , it feels like someone else . sheila grabs the bottle from junior , opens it and pours some on her shish kebab . she leans over and whispers furiously to her father .
blueface ! blueface is my favorite .
i have someone for you to play blueface with junior .
someone wants to play with me ?
i have someone for you to play with junior .
you made me hurt him !
we 're having a party for you , boy . cake and shish-k-bob , just like you love . junior cringes away from the light .
needs lubrication . lubrication .
come on , junior . everyone 's waiting for you , son . the beam of light catches junior 's face . he is crouched inside the machine at lane six . jr. his face is cut and bleeding and his straitjacket torn and filthy .
sheila !
junior 's a problem child . he has a thing about -
i want you two to pick up buzz and bring him to lane six . junior will take it from there .
no !
buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins . sid and breeze throw sideways glances at each other .
if junior thinks you 're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister , he 's gon na tap dance on your spleen .
hey , enough fun and games . we have work to do . come on junior . kastle heads for his car . junior gets up and follows . the two sleazeballs tarry as theo stands .
if i find out buzz is comin ' up short on dwarf bowling , it 's lights out for him and pink slips for you . sid and breeze look sideways at each other .
someone gon na get kacked , boss ?
it 's not an `` alley '' . i hate when people call it a `` bowling alley '' , it 's so common ! i prefer `` bowling center '' .
weird , comes into alleys and does n't bowl .
he killed your stoolie embezzler father , and he 's gon na kill you next ! sid and breeze push him towards the van as the crowd 's murmur increases . kastle turns and yells over his shoulder .
where 's junior ?
i think buzz is retiring soon . in fact , i think he 's retiring tonight . kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of sheila .
you already have a partner mr. kastle . sheila walks over as the sleazeballs ' car pulls out of the driveway .
i like you , theo . you bowl with soul .
why would you help me ?
you need a sponsor ; i have influence . i could sponsor you .
how mr. kastle ?
a guy like you could breathe some fire into bowling . you got ambition like a ... like a ... blowtorch . you go for what you want and anything that gets in your way - pssshht ! - shish kebabs . maybe lady fate washed you up on my doorstep for your own good . i think i could help you , theo .
i like the sport the way it is .
there 's a lot of competition for amusement out there . you got ta adapt to survive .
what ever happened to just bowling ?
rac . r-a-c. renovate , automate , computerize . that , my boy , is the future . one of the monitors shows a little girl bowling . her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin . kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike . the little girl jumps with joy .
he 's earned an early retirement . but enough about losers ; buzz fazeli is history . lets talk about your future . i wan na show you something .
what if he wants to get out ?
if it springs a leak , it 'll be because buzz is making waves .
nice set-up .
profits down there , philanthropy up here . besides , it beats the pants off bingo .
think of this business like a big aquarium . you got ta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top .
that 's right , did n't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament , champ ? now go take out your `` big four '' , darling . come on , we 're making her nervous .
that 's some pinfall . almost a 133 average . her ball 's flat , she needs to work on her spin control .
it 's nothing , just a slight business imbalance . how 's gloria 's thumb ?
what 's with the bad air between you two , mr. kastle ?
maybe i can help you . try a lighter ball , penelope - you 'll get hurt with that big ball , honey . i 've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit . you got fazeli blood running through you . your pop was a genuine talent in his day .
you might say i 'm at the top of their shit list .
i heard you 've been having a little trouble with the congress . theo pulls his eyes off sheila . kastle walks theo past pairs of bowlers .
nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it . you do n't mind if i have a word with theo , do you bunny ? kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away .
you know who i am ?
so you 're buzz 's boy . i 've been expecting you . you hurt my feelings when you did n't come and see me sooner .
bowling `` center '' !
do n't go near the bowling alley .
you still got the touch junior .
fantastic ! what talent .
just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you , does n't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business ! i can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that . sheila and kastle sit up .
leave him alone !
look who 's talking !
you 're using theo for your own deviant purposes !
she ran away to be with that ... that motocross champion .
that 's why mom ran away , because you had to control everything !
you 're just like you mother ! always jealous !
he stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid . crushed all the nerve endings . junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand .
after we eat , dad .
see ! no feeling . tell theo what happened to your hand , junior .
i bet you did n't know that you and junior have something in common , theo : junior ca n't bowl anymore either . is n't that right junior ? kastle slams the ketchup bottle down on junior 's right hand . the table settings jump from the shock . junior sits impassively , his face a blank .
ssssh ! now real quiet . on three . one ... two ... three !
dad , this is ridiculous . just open it .
four or five years when a girl like that 's bowling on the pro tour for team kastle , she 'll pay a handsome profit on my investment .
she hit it , mr. kastle !
i get them while they 're young . builds loyalty .
you keep that up carmelita and one day you 'll be a champion just like mr. skinner here . what do you think , theo ? think carmelita 's got the stuff ?
132 , 154 .
hello , violet . how 's my favorite 'bowlerina ' doing ?
hello , mr.kastle .
yippy !
hole in one ! you 're the queen of stroke !
strokin ' . here goes nothin ' .
no , no , that 's too far . try a more gentle stroke . it 's all in the stroke . go ahead , now , honey - stroke . as the camera comes around the side of the whale , we see an elderly man in a fire hydrant red sports coat and white slacks hunched over a diminutive fiftyish woman . his back is to the camera and he is wearing a baseball cap with a plastic halo attached to it .
like this ?
now swing it out a little to the right ...
yeah .
line up where you want it .
grasp firmly . then what ?
that 's right , sugar , find the grip that 's right for you . then grasp firmly . the camera weaves past a five foot pink whale with a gaping green mouth leading onto a mini-green .
i just hold it loosely with both hands ?
the peter pan .
where can i find him ?
careful with that one . he wo n't tell me anything , but i know there 's something strange going on over at the lanes . if you ask me , i 'd say the old fart wants to die .
he 's no father to you .
he 's my father , millie .
buzz fazeli never helps anybody but himself .
i could n't kill buzz . i need his help . theo helps millie load suitcases into the trunk of her car .
this is a sign ! someone 's coming to take buzz away from me . i do n't know if you 're the guy or what , but i 'm not letting it happen . i 'm leaving him first .
i 'm sorry about zeus , millie .
he 's not here .
they suspended me .
get that outta your mouth !
i 'm sick of you people . why do n't you leave him be ?
i 'm a bowler .
who wants to know ? zeus !
is mr. fazeli in please ?
can you change something this big ?
you bet . for five bucks , i 'll even throw in the tongue .
lips still for sale ?
i am a professional man .
very professional .
suck my dick !
sez you !
i 'm not dumping you , i 'm suspending you .
you think i 'm dumping you to get back into bowling . well who 's dumping who ?
your word is so good , you 're never gon na give it to anyone .
fuck plan c !
what about plan c ?
my word is good , and it 'll always be good . when did i ever give my word to you ?
i 'm pissing you off ? i 'm doing what i said i 'd do . what the hell are you doing ? what about your word ?
you 're really pissing me off .
who said anything about an ultimatum ? you want to find your father ? get a shovel and start digging . hurry up , he 's probably in purgatory by now . sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from theo . he moves up beside her again .
what makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum ? huh ?
sshheeiillaaa !
now he 's the one who 's locked up and i 'm the one who 's free . if i got ta do this alone , i might as well start now . she revs up and peals out .
i 've been trapped by miles kastle my whole life . she walks over to her scooter , and mounts it .
back to plan a. the vicious cycle all over again . theo lets go of sheila .
i did n't come this far to bury a guy that 's not my dad . he owes me .
theo , buzz is dead .
plan c. from now on it 's gon na be plan c. both bodies throb and grind , their sandy hands sliding over each others ' sweaty skin .
say something , theo . give me something . a doll 's legs catch fire . theo stares into sheila 's eyes .
at least i 'll die smiling .
you do n't get two chances with junior .
i killed him once , i 'll just have to kill him again .
if junior finds us , he 'll kill us both .
when i 'm with you sheila , i do n't even think about bowling . theo takes sheila in his arms and kisses her passionately . she stops him and looks around nervously .
why did you come back ?
i did your dirty work for you sheila , now fuck off . theo drives away leaving sheila standing alone . she watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression , then turns on her heel .
can i come with you ?
i think your brother may have already gotten to buzz . he gets into his car .
where are you going ?
i did n't stop to take his pulse .
are you sure he 's dead ?
you should .
i feel sick .
he 's dead sheila .
if he 's not dead , he 'll keep coming back .
you wanted me to kill him , did n't you ?
tell me what happened theo .
how do you get this thing down ?
did you - kill him ?
oh great ! he tried to kill me ! you knew he would go off if he thought i fooled around with you .
we would have sooner or later .
what the hell did you go doing that for sheila ? we have n't even gotten naked yet !
i told him you were my boyfriend .
it . bouncy-bouncy . fucked . he tried to squeeze my fucking head off . what did you say to him ? when they reach each other , they stop . sheila seems to weigh her answer .
it ?
you told junior that we did it .
i 'll be at the bridge .
you do n't have to do this . we could just cut out of here , go to akron , or anywhere else .
these open the back door . do n't let him catch you behind the machines ; if he does , you 're trapped . i 'll meet you at the bridge . theo takes the keys . sheila grabs his arm .
he 's my father .
i ca n't - i ca n't do it . he 's my brother .
it 's junior , is n't it .
i 'm afraid you 'll hurt him .
tell me , sheila . what are you afraid of ? sheila shakes her head .
i saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on tv . thunder rumbles . theo takes sheila by the shoulders .
why not ?
i ca n't tell you , theo .
are you fucking with me sheila ? is something gon na happen to buzz ? sheila seems to be trying to tell theo , but is unable .
no , but something 's gon na blow in this town . i can feel it .
you got any broken bones ?
you know how people with broken bones know when there 's a storm coming ?
too late for what , sheila ?
nothing .
way too late . buzz fazeli is history . too late for what ?
and besides , it 's probably too late , anyhow .
zip .
yeah , what did buzz fazeli ever do for you ?
why should i help that old fuck .
i 'm sure you would n't care if he needed your help , right ?
nope , i could n't care less .
it would n't bother you if buzz was in danger , would it ?
... lane six . yes .
then it 's true , is n't it ? about ...
what about the guy he put in the body cast ?
you 're here .
what are you going to do about your brother ?
if you want a professional man , you have to be willing to pay for him .
you professional men drive a hard bargain . i 'm afraid i only have five on me . sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill .
i could let them go for ten .
come on , bargain with me .
more than you could afford .
how much would you charge me for the lips ?
i may not be a pro bowler , but i 'm no amateur man . sheila moves closer to theo .
yeah , but they 're all little wannabes . i 'm looking for a professional man .
i bet you get to meet a lot of eligible bowlers .
i 'm a credit card junkie . i went on a binge and my dad bailed me out . now i 'm trapped in his easy payment plan .
so why do you stay ?
my mom told me not to stay in this town .
it 's been awhile . she did n't want me looking for my dad .
do you talk with your mom ?
really ? i kinda like it .
i do n't think your new outfit suits you , theo .
plan c ... ... is me .
what 's plan c ?
come on theo , what about plan c ?
sheila , please .
what ? be my body guard ? here 's my body , theo . guard it . for my dad 's sake . for your career . sheila starts to unbutton her bowling shirt .
he asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days .
oh really ? nothing ? my dad does n't do anything unless there 's something in it for him .
nothing .
ha ! and what do you have to do for him ?
he said he 'd sponsor me .
what do you think my dad 's gon na do for you ?
plan b is your dad .
what 's plan b ?
well , that was plan a .
so you 're hoping buzz can get you re- instated ?
i used to be kind of wild . they used to call me the bad boy of bowling .
why were you suspended ?
no , i 'm fascinated .
i wanted to be a motocross champion . my folks did n't really care what i did . then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope . most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats , i got bowling . i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously . i hope i 'm not insulting you .
i do n't know . it 's all i ever wanted to do .
theo , what would you do if you could n't bowl ?
we 'll get into that later .
do i want you ?
so , what about you ?
unfortunately what he wants is you .
nobody in this town really understands junior . when i went to family sessions for him i realized he was the sanest one in the family . actually , he 's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants .
so this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates ?
no . not at the present .
no . do you ?
do you have a boyfriend ?
not while i 'm in training .
do you have a girlfriend ?
i 'd rather you did n't .
can i ask you something personal ?
the ladies in akron call them thigh- ticklers .
you and your sideburns are the talk of the party , theo .
no , not at all .
mind if i cut in ?
it 's a vicious cycle .
whoa .
he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me , he tries to have sex with me , they send him to the nut-hut for a while ...
what does he do ?
the mental hospital .
where did your brother escape from ?
everything has it 's drawbacks .
kinda tough on the butt .
when i 'm on my bike i feel like a wild person . better than any sex i 've ever had .
is n't this technically a scooter ?
i think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do .
this is a vicious cycle .
your dad 's one of the only nice people in this fucking town . my dad is slime . kastle walks over . theo stands up and shakes kastle 's proffered hand .
having a legend for a dad is n't all it 's cracked up to be .
wo n't your father help you with that ?
business .
what do you want with my dad ?
i came here to have a word with your dad .
i 'm not here to - i ca n't ...
here theo , it 's the fazeli specialty ; a seven-ten split . theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing .
yeah , babylon . buzz runs the lanes there for my dad . everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad . theo splits .
do you know where they 're taking him ?
mine , and they never tip .
do those two work for your dad or mine ?
coming right up .
uh ... over easy .
how do you want it ? the eggs .
then i 'll have the number four with one of your finest whips .
whips ... orange whips .
what 's your specialty ?
ow ! ooh ! no , please ! doc said i 'd be back on the planks in a week ! show him breeze ! breeze pulls a copy of `` new york bowler '' from his pocket . the headline reads `` rub out ! : bowling legend kacked by dwarfscam kingpin '' with a photo of buzz fazeli .
you faked my dad 's murder . you used him ! where is he ! theo chases sid and breeze around their car . he catches sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand . sid howls .
i 'm the next of kin . i should 've seen him .
the body was identified along proper bowling congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality .
who identified the body ?
your time is up , busyboy .
why is junior 's watch in that coffin ? something stinks around here .
you call it stooling , we call it cooperating . breeze looks under theo 's car .
so , buzz was stooling for you guys .
you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .
what are you gon na do , call the bowling police ?
dwarf bowling 's illegal .
very good , busyboy .
breeze , give him his ball back !
tell your little pal to let go .
aagh ! stop ! those are my bowling fingers !
basement bingo ?
we provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community .
you guys got something going on downstairs ?
if you wan na do business in this town , there 's other people around here got more weight than old faz .
some unfinished business .
i 'm looking for somebody .
you drag that coconut around for your health , or do you know how to use it ?
i 'm not here to bowl .
lane 's closed big fellah , league night .
dr. levine , please ! return to your seat !
open it , captain !
... your civil rights have been overridden !
please , dr. levine .
let me out , captain . open the door !
calm down , dr. levine .
captain , open the hatch door , please ... the hatch door , captain . open it , please .
i ca n't ...
fletcher ! now !
i ca n't see ...
get out of there !
it 's burning ...
fletcher , get away from there ...
fletcher , i want you back here .
they 're warm . i can feel the heat on my legs .
they 're like pink snow , sir . sticky .
fletcher ? what are you doing out there ?
pull it , damn it !
norman , please ! do n't !
now !
do n't do it !
norman , do n't do it !
do it , norman , it 's the only choice we have . this thing is gon na crush us .
do n't pull it , norman . it 'll start a < u > fire < /u > we ca n't stop . norman ?
do you see it ?
do n't do it , norman !
it 's either that or we grow gills .
that 's our reserve air .
increase positive pressure !
he 's right beneath us .
what was that ?
why ca n't i -- ? what the hell is going on here ?
where is it ?
what are you saying -- we ca n't stop what 's out there ?
thirty yards .
sure . each time it started fires inside the habitat .
but you 've tested it ?
forty yards .
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface . but we 've never used it underwater before .
high voltage ?
we 're a habitat . not a castle . the only defense we have is high voltage .
what do we use for defense ?
fifty yards and closing .
what if it attacks ?
a squid ? the size of a whale ? i do n't think so . target acquired . sixty yards .
what was that ?
direction 's east coming !
shut up , beth . i do n't want to hear it .
nice work , captain sir .
you 're a fucking biochemist , are n't you ? ca n't you tell us something .
i 'm not sure . i 've never seen anything like it .
nobody move !
but she 's --
nobody move .
forgive me . i 've never read the navy manual . i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures .
there are procedures , beth , that i want followed . my procedures . and considering what 's going on , i want you to follow them very closely .
yeah . i heard you .
back at the door -- i asked you to back away .
two and a half days ?
they told me about sixty hours .
how long will that be ?
the surface ships will be back . after the storm clears .
edmunds , do you have a 20 on norman ?
norman !
what are you -- his mother ? get norman , i want everyone ready to go . edmunds , the subs ?
i am not leaving without him . do you hear me ? we come down as a team , we leave as a team .
yeasts ? thank you , beth , but i do n't think we 're gon na open it up and find a loaf of bread .
not everything . even on earth . take ... yeasts .
how about i just press the button ?
alright , beth , do that thing you did before .
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up ?
what is it ?
hold on --
would you wait a minute ?
i said back away .
wait a minute --
back away then .
there 's heat coming the door .
basic english ? there 's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet .
in basic english , what does all this mean ?
of what we 're able to measure , roughly twenty-six hundred feet .
how big is this spacecraft ?
pull it .
i see it .
you see the lever on the green box ? upper right hand corner ?
yes , sir . i 'm here .
ted , go into the control room . listen for my instructions .
jerry ? please . stop this .
what the hell ? it shut us down .
jerry ?
going active .
no . i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat . he might be listening now .
maybe so . but i think we need to ask jerry about it .
bullshit . what 's out there is n't alien . it 's an animal .
yes , i do . whatever 's out there , i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier .
you think he killed edmunds ?
but sir , i think it 's imperative . i think the messages , the animals we 've seen , what killed edmunds , the reading you got earlier -- i think they 're all related .
i do n't want you talking to jerry .
at least our obituaries will be accurate . that 's reassuring .
if something should happen to us , the navy will at least have partial records of what happened .
what for ?
edmunds ? can you copy ?
... it raises a very serious question : < u > what happens if jerry < /u > < u > gets mad < /u > ?
damn it , edmunds ?
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional ...
edmunds ?
i think we should be careful . consider his emotional response .
you do n't think weapons are important ?
that 's smart . let 's talk about guns and violence .
great , okay . ask him about his weapons .
what am i -- a dog , now ?
the message does n't show a lack of intelligence . it 's smart . it 's approaching us in a simple way . like you would a dog . holding out your hand , letting it sniff , get used to you .
he translated it wrong . `` my name is jerry '' ? it 's like `` see spot run . ''
-- without a cautionary word to anyone . you know , ted said something to me earlier . i think he 's right . he said , `` when you got a guy who -- if he was n't here -- he 'd be standing in the unemployment line , you got ta question if you got the right guy . ''
-- i did n't know it would come to this --
-- and then brought her down here --
wait a second --
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
at the time , i do n't know , i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break .
so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
'81 , i think . she tried again five years ago . i thought you should know .
when was this ?
she put a razor to her wrists a day later .
she should 've known better .
a while back , beth and i -- we worked at the same university . she was assisting a chemist there -- i forget his name -- doing research , experiments . she was also living with him . yeah , i know . and when she finished her work , he kicked her out , broke off the relationship , and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement .
i think i do .
you do n't want to know .
how drastic ?
i 'm not paranoid . i know beth . she can be drastic .
no `` buts '' . if he wants to be left , we 'll leave him . hello ? yes , the subs -- i want a report ... hello ... yes , a report . gim me ... shit .
but sir --
i told you people , nobody goes anywhere unless i say .
you ca n't just leave harry down here , sir .
he 's here somewhere . find him . the sub 's on it 's way . go ! c'mon !
he 's missing . he 's gone . he left .
what do you mean , he 's missing ?
harry 's missing .
just worry about yourself .
all i 'm saying is , someone should keep an eye on him .
look , the ships are clearing out . they 're taking us topside in a matter of minutes . someone can check him out there , if it 's that imprtant .
i 'm telling you , harry 's lost it . he 's saying there 's a deathwish out for each of us .
do n't get hysterical , norman .
everything can be killed .
i do n't know . that 's the point .
you mean , what 's in that thing is immortal ?
or maybe , it ca n't < u > be < /u > killed .
like `` thou shall not kill '' ?
if it is alien , maybe we should n't try to open it at all .
what ?
maybe we should n't .
i do n't know . but it 's something alien .
picked up something ? what is it ?
take a look .
what is it , norman ?
it 's a corrosive gas . on earth , it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly , iron rust on an oldsmobile . at a pressure this low , oxygen becomes toxic . breathe it down here , and it 'll do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile .
what 's wrong with oxygen ?
they pressurize us with helium .
but sir , i do n't understand . this report -- these recommendations ... they 're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life .
your report 's become our bible down here , dr. johnson . we 've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail .
ulf report ? nobody 's mentioned that in years . you mean someone actually read it ?
the one you recommended . in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration .
what team ?
we think it might . that 's why we brought you here . we 've assembled your team -- they 're waiting for us now .
it does n't make any sense .
off the record , i do n't mind telling you , this thing scares the shit out of me .
i 'm afraid it is dr. johnson ... because it 's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor .
it 's impossible .
extraordinary , is n't it ?
-- there 's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft ? there 's no such thing ... our space program is n't even forty years old .
maybe older --
hold on --
-- dating the crash at least that old .
-- wait a second --
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
geologists ?
see this ? coral . geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick .
as best we can estimate , it crashed four hundred years ago .
not really , no . something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news , why you 've kept everything a secret ... when did it crash ?
something like that . that does n't surprise you ?
what is it ? a military spacecraft ? like a shuttle or satellite ?
what do you need me for ?
what ?
then why am i here ?
survivors ? no , i would n't think so .
a thousand ? an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- i do n't want to sound pessimistic here , but i assume there are no survivors .
a thousand feet .
how deep is he ?
they did n't tell me anything .
a cyclone 's on it 's way in . i thought they would have told you on the phone .
storm ? what storm ?
we 're moving fast considering the storm .
well , we do n't have all the facts yet .
from what ? what 's with all the security ?
good . security 's been our biggest worry . now that you 're here we can shut this thing down tight .
press ? no , i have n't .
you talk to any reporters ? any press ?
nothing else .
anything else ?
the usual . plane crash . survivers unknown . routine stuff really .
what have you been told so far ?
what team ?
come with me . the team 's already waiting .
the pentagon ? i did n't know i had friends in washington .
do n't thank me , dr. johnson . you were n't my choice . the pentagon made me take you .
well , thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it .
captain . right , forgive me .
captain .
thank you , colonel .
in a minute , sir .
edmunds , get in here . i need you for this .
if the subs are n't here yet , sir --
norman , get out of there now ! norman ?
sir ! sir , the door -- it 's opening .
they 've left , keep watching !
sir , if the subs have n't left by now ...
in the ship , sir .
well , where the fuck is he ?
yes , sir .
what the hell is going on here ?
nothing , sir .
fuck him . what ? hello ?
nothing , sir .
any sign of harry ?
they 're coming .
i 'm getting no sub reading , sir .
send them , damn it ! i know , but i 'm not gon na be held responsible --
subs are still at surface , sir .
harry ? can you copy ?
get him out of there . i thought i told you people --
nothing . i do n't know . everything was normal . no changes at all .
what caused it ?
well , shit -- find something , do something ... make something up --
we do n't have anything else to try , sir .
thank you , i can see that . try something else .
it 's not sucking , sir .
working on it now , sir .
can you open that panel ?
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gon na appear to us like magic .
she wired this system .
she 's not gon na know .
edmunds ? get in here . i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted .
what -- you want me to retype it ?
with an `` o '' . harold with an `` o '' .
i 'm in charge .
he 's saying , `` take me to your leader . '' he wants to know who 's in charge .
what ?
she 's not gon na know , sir .
not now , beth . please . i want to know who we 're talking to before we start talking . where 's edmunds ?
he understands me fine .
are you enjoying yourself , harry , because i do n't know what the hell you 're doing .
it 's not ignorant .
ignorant . the thing 's ignorant .
how do you mean , strange ?
i have to tell you . it 's strange .
what 's the message ?
... spiralling out of the center , you see : `` g '' is one , `` b '' is two , `` h '' is three , and so on ... when i got the message .
we 're all very proud of you , harry , but what the hell is it ?
it 's a single sequence repeated over and over .
please watch your closest monitor ...
who is that ? where 's that coming from ?
ladies and gentlemen ...
gim me a report , i want --
just tell me worst case . worst case of what we might find ?
let 's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us , just like we are to , say , medieval europe . suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set . there would n't be any place to plug it in .
you do n't know that .
it could . but the odds of it being any use to us are against it .
or it could contain some great benefit to us , some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind .
it 's nonsense . there 's enough difference between our own species to prove that .
so ? what 's the problem ?
the what ?
man is man , all he knows is man , and all he can think of is what he knows . the anthropomorphic problem . good , norman .
ted seems to have some ideas .
so how do we get it open ?
a break for what ?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere .
what ?
no . they do n't represent a message . they are n't decorative at all . they have another purpose entirely .
so do we . and it seems to have picked up something on it 's travels .
we know how this craft got here . where it 's been .
yes , harry .
ted ? captain ?
then how can it be chipped ?
i did .
i thought you said there was n't any damage done in the crash ?
i do n't know how it can be chipped , but it 's chipped .
chipped ? the door ? how can it be chipped ?
it 's chipped .
i 'm not saying anything , harry , i 'm just stating the facts . the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy , built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb . the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented .
right . so you 're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch ?
to the craft ? none . not a scratch .
how much damage ?
in the dome hanger . all our tapes are transferred to the sub . it 's on a 12 hour timer . if someone does n't reset the `` delay '' button , the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes .
what sub ?
resetting the sub .
what was edmunds doing outside ?
well , until we know exactly what it is , nobody goes outside , understood ?
too big ?
it wo n't register . it 's too big to image .
what ?
the sensors are picking up something outside .
what is that ?
do n't make stuff up , these emotional theories , just so you can feel important here .
edmunds ?
give him a chance . he 's speaking our language , not the other way around .
it 's not talking , it 's mimicking .
i am not gon na explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named jerry .
captain , i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
i want a name . a real name . this thing 's full name , rank and serial number .
what 's inside the sphere .
from the sphere ?
get out of there . i do n't want anyone going anywhere outside , understood ?
she says jellyfish are a delicacy . you know , i never knew that .
internal power .
to what ?
they switched us over .
we 're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he ca n't just walk outside !
sir , about leaving --
how can he be missing ?
ted , shut up . are you packed ? ready to go ? i want everyone packed . now !
did you hear me , sir , because --
what ? no , i know they 're civilians ...
can i stay , sir ? i 'm willing to risk it . i am . after what we just witnessed .
maybe it 's a message of some sort , you know ? see this red here .
but what does it do ? this ... sphere .
maybe we did n't want to come back .
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back ?
time travel . i always thought it was one of those myths ... like santa 's reindeer .
considered what ? that it 's american ? how would you think it 's american ?
we had considered it .
what do you make of this ?
what 's wrong ?
a foot and a half thick ? that 'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation .
radiation shield , you think ?
some sort of lead or something .
what is it ?
look at this .
what are you going to do -- shoot her ?
ted , get her away from the door .
what if we go out there , you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open .
what < u > about < /u > a crowbar ?
duly noted , ted . edmunds , try using suction .
i 'd also like it noted --
nobody goes inside , until we know < u > what 's < /u > inside .
captain , you know , i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television .
the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we 've seen .
a half a mile long ?
down below , harry said we would all have to die . since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone . death was the only logical explanation . but sitting here , we still know . so how is that possible ? unless we make ourselves forget .
how 's that ?
yes . and i think we already know it will .
would it work ?
get away --
beth --
get away from me !
hear what ?
you hear that ?
what ?
what is that ? what are you doing ?
let 's get out of here , beth . let 's go home .
top shelf , is it ?
c'mon --
oh , sure . here . anything else , beth can get you ? some more chicken , perhaps . let beth check the fridge .
beth -- gim me the gun .
do n't tell me about me . i already know too much .
i --
oh please , do n't shrink me , norman . not now .
i know . you 're too strong , beth .
you ca n't stop it , norman . you ca n't fight me .
leave me alone , norman .
beth ?
it 's you , norman . your fear of drowning . you have to face it .
stop it !
from you , norman . from your mind . you 're doing it .
then where 's it coming from ?
stop what ? do n't blame me . it 's not me .
beth , stop it !
do n't you know ?
where is it coming from , beth ?
you 're frightened , are n't you , norman ?
beth !
i 'm not fucking with you , norman . you 've fucked yourself .
do n't fuck with me , beth .
of course you 're going to deny it . you want to blame someone else . you want to blame beth . because you hate beth .
get away from the door , beth .
this is what i 'm talking about , norman . do n't you see ? it 's in you . this vindictiveness . this rage .
you think i care ? you think i care if i die ? would i put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically , if i cared about myself ? would i ? i 've tried twice before , norman , why would n't i try a third time ? i 'm not thinking about myself -- no , norman , i 'm thinking about you . your safety . protecting you from your own self .
it 's not safe for you to be either .
it 's your choice . because it 's not safe for you to be awake . to be walking around . to be thinking about things .
it 's either this ... or i kill you .
do n't , beth . please .
you think i 'd belive you ? believe anything you might say now ? after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past . about my problems . my problems . not yours . not his . mine .
beth --
promise what , norman ? tell me !
i promise --
but i have to , norman .
do n't , beth .
`` it 's not me , beth . it 's not me . it ca n't be . i 'm not doing anything . '' just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle .
it 's not me , beth . i swear . it ca n't be .
i 'm not scaring you , am i norman ? i hope i 'm not frightening you . the last thing i want to do is frighten you . you feel okay , do n't you ?
when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking ? do you know ? `` i ca n't get beth on the radio . i 'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean . all alone . surrounded by all this water . '' was it really the squid that was attacking you , norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears ? you never really saw what it was , did you ?
shut up , beth --
no , it is n't . your name is norman . but your younger brother -- what was his name ? the one who was stung when you were younger . the one that died . the one you could n't save . what was his name ? `` mommy , we 're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming . '' `` but i do n't want to go swimming , norman . i 'm scared . '' `` c'mon , < u > harry < /u > , it 'll be fine , it 'll be fun . '' you heartless fuck . that 's why you 're so scared of the water , is n't it ?
beth , the message said harry . `` my name is harry '' . my name is n't harry .
is it ?
that 's bullshit .
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere , you remember that -- when the sphere opened ? that 's right . but you ca n't remember going inside , can you ? no , of course not . harry could n't either , could he ? `` like everything 's on the tip of my tongue '' , he said .
yes .
you do n't remember you did . but i 'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry , do n't you ? you remember that .
i never went in that sphere .
am i ? or am i making so much sense that you 're going insane ?
you 're insane .
did i ? or was that you ? when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened , did n't you ? terrified . like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor . you did that , norman .
you manifested that , beth .
one lonely , terrifying sea snake .
that 's when you went in the sphere .
and the snakes ? you want to know about the snakes ? you saw one outside earlier , did n't you ? when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified .
but --
am i lying ? are you sure ? are you absolutely sure i 'm lying ? then explain to me about the jellyfish . earlier . why did we see jellyfish ? harry does n't fear jellyfish . you do . they 're your fear , are n't they ?
you 're lying --
c'mon -- what ?
beth you 're losing it . c'mon .
yes , someone did . but it was n't me , norman . it was you . you manifested the snakes .
someone did .
you think i manifested the snakes ?
then why , beth ? why go in ? why put out explosives ? why manifest the snakes ?
no , he ca n't .
he ca n't manifest .
no , he is n't .
against what ? harry 's unconscious . he 's not a threat .
same reason i put explosives around the habitat . for defense . for the power . to protect myself .
why did you go in the sphere , beth ?
what 's the phrase -- `` keeping up with the joneses '' ?
did you ?
if i was , then i would 've had to have gone in the sphere , would n't i ?
are you manifesting them ?
do n't you ?
do you fear them ?
you tell me .
what are they doing down here ? in the bathroom ? suddenly appearing .
am i afraid of them ? not during the day . sea snakes are diurnal . when the sun 's out , they do n't bite . fortunately for you , i had on my watch . this is quite good .
you know what i mean .
snakes ? what do you mean , exactly ?
how do you feel about snakes ?
i did do that , did n't i ?
you put explosives around the habitat , i ca n't imagine what you 'd put in a drink .
you do n't think i put something in it , do you ?
you think i 'd really drink that ?
it 's getting cold .
are you ?
i 'm feeling better .
what 's wrong , norman ?
oh yes , my watch . i almost forgot .
your watch .
what was that ? i could n't hear you .
how 's harry ?
the grooves around the door -- they 've shifted . and the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now .
what do you mean , different ?
the sphere looks different .
in the sub . resetting the timer . why ?
where are you ?
what is it , norman ?
you 're not sorry . you 're scared . you 're a psychologist , norman . you pride yourself on knowing when someone 's lying to you , not telling you the truth . and now you 're scared ... because you 're not sure you can tell anymore .
not believing you .
for what ?
i 'm sorry .
only lab rats . here .
thirty years ago . in residency . i passed out . you ?
you ever given an injection before .
look , it 's either him or us , norman . another attack , and we go down with this place .
you want to kill him ?
to be on the safe side . i mean --
beth --
it 's an idea .
what if it takes 20 minutes , norman ? what if it takes an hour ? and he can fight it off ? we ca n't afford that .
does n't say .
how fast does it take effect ?
what ? wait -- is n't that dangerous ?
i 'll just boost the doses .
three to six hours .
how long does it last ?
`` 20 cc 's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc 's of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures ... no cardiac side effects ... rem activity is surpressed ... ``
`` ... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride ... ``
it 's like a sleeping pill ?
causes sleep .
what 's that ?
it 's a soporific .
p-a-r-a-s-o ...
how do you spell it ?
parasolutrine ?
antibiotic .
damn it ! chloramphenicol ?
antihistamine . for bites .
riordan ?
`` ... and may also cause bizarre halucinations '' .
bingo .
tranquilizer . causes drowsiness .
tarazine ?
nothing about drowsiness .
does it cause drowsiness ? that 's all we need . to get him unconscious -- put him under .
a synthetic opium analogue .
sintag .
ulcers .
valdomet .
it 's for motion sickness .
ephedrine hydrochloride .
something for burns .
diphenyl parlene .
why would harry go back to using a code ?
looks like some sort of code .
must be . and if it is -- it 's a part of him not even he can control .
and that 's the part of harry that 's being manifested .
no . i mean , we 've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences . you ever read the bible ? it talks about our sinful nature , you know ? i mean , we can think , and believe , and desire whatever we want , but there 's a part of us -- a shadow side , as jung called it -- that ca n't be controlled . it 's evil . it 's inside us . it 's what we are .
his dream ? you ca n't control your dreams . and you ca n't control your fears , can you ?
he must not realize he is . like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then . he must 've manifested his dream .
but why is he doing it ?
it 's his fear . the squid . he 's manifesting his fears . making them real .
which i told barnes was attacking --
i do n't know , beth . i 'm not the fucking alien that built the thing . but it can . when harry came out of the sphere , he mumbled something about page 87. how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to . then you found the book , remember in your lab . then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid ...
how can the sphere do that ?
i do n't know .
but how ?
he acquired some sort of power . a power to manifest things .
you think , in the sphere --
when did the messages start ? the animals outside start showing up ? after harry came out of the sphere .
what do you mean , a part of harry ?
remember when we first spoke to jerry , barnes kept asking for jerry 's real name ? but harry never would ? he did n't because he was afraid the screen would say `` harry '' , instead of jerry . we were n't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry , we were talking to harry ... or a part of harry .
what ?
he translated it wrong .
created . brought to life . i do n't know . but at the end , jerry said , `` stop calling me jerry '' . and --
manifested ?
after the attack , a navy guy woke me up -- i do n't know -- i thought he was an illusion . but i checked the tape , and jerry said he manifested him .
`` ... according to calculations of some naturalists , one of these animals , only six feet long , would have tentacles 27 feet long . that would make a formidable monster . ''
squids ?
`` our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long . some skeletons of squids ...
page 87 . `` i could never read that far . ''
what ?
page 87 .
damn it , norman ! he 's lying . do n't you get it ? there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he 's causing it . why ca n't you believe me ?
i do n't know , beth . i was n't there .
you think it 's me ? you think i 'm saying there was a conversation when there was n't ?
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit .
damn it , norman . i swear . i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up .
all i know is i opened that refridgerator --
you do n't believe me .
you think ?
no , it was n't . i swear none of this was here . none of it . you think he hid it ? earlier . he must 've hid it .
did you look ? it was on the top shelf .
none of this was here before .
1-800-deepsea delivery . i hear they 're good .
wait a second --
we must 've had it delivered then .
that was n't in there before .
it 's a pretty common place to look for food when you do n't think you have any .
the refridgerator .
the refridgerator .
fixing it ? but i fixed -- where 'd you get all that ?
fixing it .
what 's harry doing with your suit in there ?
i think so , beth . yes .
you get it straightened out ?
he what ?
deserts you ? harry said he 'd take over for me .
yeah , well , i get that way when i 'm facing death and someone deserts me .
getting food . we were out of food . what 's wrong ? you sound mad .
what are you doing in the ship ? beth ?
... what do you mean ? i 'm in the ship .
still clear .
still clear ?
you ca n't . counter 's at 10 minutes . you do n't have time .
my air is n't ... i 'm coming back .
yes , norman . i did . you 're just nervous .
you fixed this suit ? beth ?
what 's the matter ?
still clear .
i ca n't see anything . how does it look ? still clear ?
the sub 's a 100 feet in front of you . you see it ?
you press a button , norman . it 's not brain surgery . here , go ahead . you only have 15 minutes to reset it . go on , norman ...
but i do n't know how --
you do n't trust me ?
you fixed my suit ?
i fixed your suit .
i would . but my suit --
i do n't trust harry to do it .
in case you die , too ?
you should know how it works . just in case .
why should i go ?
maybe you should go . to the sub .
get the helium out of our bloodstream . we go to the surface now , we 'd pop like a soda bottle .
four days ?
we ca n't . the storm . the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here . and we have four days of decompression when we get up top .
wake him , then . let 's go . get outta --
you , me and harry . he 's asleep .
you , me and harry ?
it 's also our only way out of here ! it holds three people . and there 's only three of us left now .
it 's not worth the risk .
do n't bother me , norman .
forget the sub .
i have to reset the sub .
where are you going in such a hurry ?
no , i should stay calm . like you say . right , norman ? stay calm .
beth --
yeah , okay . sure , norman .
beth , i did n't . hold it together . alright ?
you bastard .
do n't do this .
you did , did n't you ?
beth --
you told him about me ?
what ?
you said something to him , did n't you ?
it 's done , alright ? it 's over ! and there 's not a damn thing we can do about it now , okay ?
do n't tell me to calm down !
calm down , beth . alright ?
he 's not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon .
you went through edmunds ' things ?
in edmunds ' things .
where did you get this ?
`` although advised of risks , all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft . signed , barnes , usn . ''
fuck you , norman ! it 's right here ...
you 're jumping to conclusions , beth . do n't get worked up --
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute ? nobody .
so what ?
yeah , he < u > told < /u > you . think . what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose ? he was on the phone . except that cable is a thousand feet long , norman . they would 've broken off communication with us four , five minutes before they cleared out .
c'mon , beth . do n't make this personal . he told me himself they were taking us back .
... he lied to us . he left us down here .
eggs .
what are they ?
norman .
what could have done this ?
she was crushed . feel her skin -- it 's like sandpaper .
i ca n't feel her bones . she 's like a sponge .
beth .
i did n't do anything wrong . i did n't mean ...
beth --
nobody said ... norman ... what ? why are you looking at me like that ?
beth .
what ? ... wait . do n't ... why are you --
they are or they are n't . which is it ?
i mean , i 'm not ... i was n't absolutely sure if ... they --
beth --
what ? why ...
and you did n't tell anyone ?
yeah , why ?
you knew about the squid not being normal . before fletcher went out there ?
what ?
wait a minute .
they have six tentacles . a new species . and the squid too . they had no stomach .
what do you mean -- not normal ?
normally , i 'd say no . everything 's quiet now -- no ships , no divers , no electricity . makes sense . but what 's curious is -- these are n't normal jellyfish .
me ? well , i was wrapped in seaweed . it itched for a while , but i survived . beth , do you find it ... curious that we 're seeing all this life down here . nothing , and then these enormous flocks of squid . then jellyfish ?
what about you ? what happened to you ?
yeah , it was awful .
my gosh , norman .
... when i was six , my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific . at my mother 's beach house . we both felt stinging , and when we came out of the water , he was wearing jellyfish head to toe . killed him .
no , thank you . i hate jellyfish .
a bad one . it was the only book in there . norman , come here , look at this .
we have a library ?
the library .
where 'd this come from ?
disrupt our brain waves , interfere with our ability to think .
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas .
get this thing off me .
norman !
good theory , ted .
400 years ago ? i 'm sure christopher columbus would 've loved these accomodations .
such a gentlemen when you 're scared shitless .
no . go ahead . really . ladies first .
you 're next , norman .
yeah . drowning .
is n't there a psychological term for that , dr. johnson ?
what -- are you threatening me ?
just keep your mouth shut , alright ? this could mean everything to our careers , you know that ? do n't jeopardize this .
the timing has never seemed quite right .
well , let 's pray that 's the only mistake you made . have you said anything to barnes about this ?
it never occurred to me .
well , you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here . in the ocean . 70 percent of the earth 's surface is water , norman . that 's first grade geography .
we ca n't go down there . we 're not prepared . that deep ? that takes years of training , beth . we 're just scientists . lab scietists . we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks .
what do you expect ? for them to bring it up here ?
underwater ?
to the spacecraft . to investigate .
wait -- down where ?
because when we get down there --
c'mon , beth -- that report 's like the blind leading the blind .
do yourself a favor , norman . are you listening ? do n't tell anyone what you just told me .
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re-runs of the twilight zone . seriously . i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
that 's quite a secret .
it 's bullshit . the report 's a joke .
i 've read it twice , norman . it 's brilliant .
that ulf report everybody 's patting me on the back about ?
i love secrets .
beth , look , can i trust you with a little secret ?
who says it 's a he ?
he does n't wait for an answer .
by the bunks .
norman ? where 's norman ?
i 'm a woman . i do n't theorize . i only deal with facts .
well , what 's your theory ?
it does n't make any sense .
i do n't get it .
well , they 're not mine .
well , think . because there 's footprints here that are n't mine .
no . i do n't think so .
what 's that -- mistake number two , norman ?
pussy .
wo n't make any difference . the tapes document everything .
we can refuse to talk .
they 're going to want answers and they 're going to keep asking until they get them .
yes you are ...
no i 'm not . i 'm not star --
you 're staring at me .
like what ? i 'm not --
why are you looking at me like that ?
another attack ?
our habitat , i mean . this place ca n't handle another attack .
just in time for what ?
what ?
in time for what ?
just in time , too .
yeah , i do n't know how you could make that confusion .
i 'm sorry . slip of the tongue .
that 's a hell of a mistake to make , beth .
jerry . right . i said jerry , did n't i ?
harry ? that 's bullshit . we stood right there --
we never even had a conversation , norman .
yes you did . norman , i would n't leave you out there . you know that .
i never said that .
when he woke up , he said we were out of food . he told me to get some from the ship .
cannibalism , to be extreme . and now we 're talking about a new life form . their values and ethics may be incomprehensible .
take politics , our views on abortion , the death penalty ...
a light switch . a button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power .
what are you looking for ?
it 's an american spacecraft .
then what is it ?
you 'd have to ask them .
it 's empty . why would someone build a ship like this ?
for whoever 's in that thing .
for who ? the fish ?
all that banging and pounding . i do n't know . we should think about making a good first impression .
pry the thing open ? what are we -- neanderthals ?
harry thinks it 's some sort of discharge from our own system , but i 've seen it discharge before -- and it did n't look anything like this .
is it coming from our own computer ?
no idea . we have no surface support . it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater .
where 's it coming from ?
minutes ago . harry 's trying to decode it in his room now .
when did it come across ?
it would erase all our knowledge of it . all of our power .
you mean forget ?
the power allows us to manifest our fears , right ? what if we feared the power to go away ?
we all kill ourselves ? bad joke . sorry , beth .
there is one possibility .
no . i do n't . but i always said to myself , when i die , i want to die laughing .
good . thank you . now that i have it on . why are you laughing ? you do n't even know what that means .
how 's that working out , by the way ?
it 's not fast enough , norman . there 's a helluva lot of explosive down there .
nine hundred feet to surface .
less than a minute , we 're never gon na make it .
wait !
well , press something !
no idea .
you know how to work this thing ?
i 'm trying . there .
get her out of the seat , i need room to sit . harry ?
you got her ?
her legs are in the way .
just pull her -- down like inside -- harry , work with me here !
gim me a second --
i 'm trying to keep balance with --
c'mon , norman !
shut up and catch .
three fifty-six , three fifty-five , three --
i heard ! i heard !
hurry , norman . four minutes .
hold on .
are you trying , damn it ? just --
missed .
i 'm trying . shit . here -- catch her .
push her , c'mon .
hold on .
i ca n't reach her .
how far away 's the sub ?
two and a half minutes . once we 're in the sub .
how much time you figure to get to the surface ?
shut up and open the door .
we 're never gon na make it .
help me lift her .
fine .
i could hit her a little harder . more toward the cranium .
i do n't think so .
did i kill her ?
stop what ? what are you -- ?
it 's the squid ! stop it !
you know what it is , harry .
what is it ?
is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag ?
that 's right .
the three of us .
we just figured , you know , the three of us -- we need to ... work together through this .
do n't have to . watch . it 'll do it for you .
how do we decode it ?
navy transmission . they 're sent from wisconsin .
wisconsin ?
wisconsin 's your answer .
she 's lying , norman . just like she lied about fixing your suit .
but why would she -- ?
i was just in the cafeteria , there 's plenty of food in there . take a look for yourself .
you did n't say that about the food ?
she 's cracking , norman .
i thought she was with you .
beth left ?
her suit 's gone .
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me .
when i woke up , nobody was here .
what do you mean ? she 's not here ?
what happened to her ?
thank you . my suit -- beth said she fixed it --
you 're clear . you see the airlock ?
i ca n't breathe ... am i ... clear ?
norman , where are you ?
harry ?
... you there ? norman ?
i do n't remember much . it 's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but i ca n't taste any of it . funny , my senses are much keener though . purer . hearing , seeing , smelling . like , i can smell your sheets , norman . you tried to wash it out earlier , but i can still smell the urine . do n't worry , i 'm not going to tell the others . it 's normal , really , is n't it ? in a crisis . the stress . the panic .
you do n't remember that ?
did i ?
you said something to me , before -- about how we were all going to die .
do n't do this . do n't psychoanalyze me . i hate squid . period . just like you hate jellyfish .
have you looked outside ? jellyfish . everywhere . i hate jellyfish . harry , what happened in the cafeteria ?
there 's some sort of pattern here . it 'll take a minute .
getting anywhere with those ?
what are they ?
these are n't half bad , fletcher . you might have a second career coming .
that far in what , harry ?
i could never read that far . i never wanted to .
page 87 of what , harry ?
what happens on page 87 ? have you ever read page 87 ?
what is it , harry ?
norman ?
then explain it to me .
you do n't understand about the sphere .
tell me about the door . do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere ? ... harry ?
you were all supposed to leave . you were n't supposed to stay down here .
you remember opening the door ?
what are you still doing here ?
harry , can you tell me about the sphere ?
it 's like ...
what noise ?
what is that ? that noise ?
curious , is n't it ? what 's inside ? before i die , i 'd sure like to open it and see .
it 's what 's in that sphere , is n't it , harry ? whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it 's going to kill you .
then what , norman ?
no . i did n't say that .
you mean , you think i 'm cracking ?
look -- we 're under a lot of pressure , we 're tired , you 're not thinking straight .
am i ?
i ca n't . if i had a minute to think , maybe , but i know you 're wrong .
gim me another explanation .
i ca n't believe that , harry .
meaning we 're never gon na get to the surface alive ... to tell anyone .
meaning we 're never gon na get the chance to tell anyone .
so , < u > we know < /u > . we know it went through a black hole . we saw it . norman -- when we 'd get to the surface , we 'd tell someone about the black hole , would n't we ? it 'd go in some report like some big discovery . so in fifty years when they build that ship , they 'd make precautions for a black hole . < u > but they did n't < /u > . the called it an unknown entry event .
so what ?
on that flight recorder , they called the black hole an `` unknown entry event . '' they did n't know what a black hole was . fifty years from now , men are going to build that ship in a very tentative , experimental way , with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible .
i do n't follow you .
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible .
not a clue .
i 'm completely serious . there is something very important missing from that spacecraft . you know what that is ?
do n't be so optomistic , harry .
good point . i do n't know what you 're talking about , but good point .
and we 're just talking about three- dimensional creatures . what if it 's five or six or seven-dimensional ? so dimensional that we could n't even see it to kill it .
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human . if it does n't look human , it 's a reptile or a big insect or something , having human values , human understanding .
i mentioned it in my report . did n't you read the report ?
our present .
but on the way home , they miss their turn , go too far , into the past .
this spacecraft was designed to pick things up . they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in . they come across this . this ... < u > sphere < /u > . find it interesting , curious . they draw it inside to take back home .
which one ? let me get the list out .
this answers one of our questions .
time travel . a black hole .
to what ?
our answer .
whatever i can do to help .
nice work , norman .
look , would you --
c'mon , norman .
wait a second , i --
c'mon .
no , why do n't --
go ahead . ladies first .
i 'm fine .
you sound defensive .
i 'm not being defensive .
do n't be defensive .
fine . i 'm fine .
you holding up alright ?
what ?
how are you feeling , norman ?
it 's like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer . he 'd run screaming `` witchcraft '' . and you could n't explain it to him , either . modems , microchips , particle physics .
do n't gim me that psychology bullshit , norman . psychology is n't a science , it 's superstition . it 's a bunch of soft , subjective theories without any hard data to back it up . with an intellect like this , emotions do n't mean shit .
thank you .
good idea , ted .
`` we are friends '' .
what 'd you say ?
codes are for < u > hiding < /u > information . so it 's making a mistake . it 's making a code without intending to . i figured it 's probably substituting numbers for letters ... then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard . and since we 're getting spirals , i imagined the keyboard as a spiral . so i translated it ...
see ? no code . what 'd i say ?
... i asked myself , why would the sphere be using a code ? if you 're trying to communicate , why use a code ?
yeah , i 'll work on it , too .
if it is a message , it 's probably a substitution code . i 'll work on it .
it 's not a discharge . right , edmunds ? you said before , right ? so it 's got ta be a message .
well , if it 's a discharge --
impotent ? i 'm not impotent .
salt 's good for you , ted . helps you from getting impotent .
hey , go easy on the salt , will ya ? we 're not a bunch of icy streets here .
look closely . that is n't writing . those are grooves .
looks like a design , some writing , maybe . maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message .
not where . when . 400 years ago . from our future .
arrived ? from where ?
it did n't fly here . it < u > arrived < /u > here .
please . it must have flown here --
meaning it did n't land in the water .
meaning ?
we take a weeny little wedge , bang on it a couple of times , and bust off a chunk of the metal . yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity , say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it 's gon na be like hitting concrete , it would crumple like paper . but there is n't a dent to be seen anywhere . not even a scratch .
it 's been obvious from the start , has n't it , captain ? that 's why all the secrecy , why no one was told about it ?
an american spacecraft ? half a mile long ? and buried 400 years ? yeah , good theory , harry .
save your breath . it 's not an alien spacecraft .
if it is an alien spacecraft --
do you ?
gim me a minute here ... i think i 've got it .
all the facts you need are right in front of you .
unless , this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable .
think about it .
why would this ship carry instructions in english ?
is it ?
but it 's impossible .
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it ? someone went to a lot of trouble . try again .
is it some sort of joke ? like one of those hoaxes ?
you do n't think it does ? i think it 's rather obvious .
that 's right .
english ?
shutup , ted . you did n't notice shit . keep hammering .
alot like . you know , i noticed it before , but i did n't ...
gim me some room here , will you ? back off . gim me some space .
easy ted , we 're not mining gold .
you 're not afraid of the water , are you , norman ?
it 's just like swimming , norman ... you know how to swim , do n't you ?
just one of norman 's many secrets .
what is it , harry ?
she told me what you said , norman .
norman thinks we should n't be going down . thinks it 's a mistake .
what does norman already know ?
to who ? arthur ? nothing . nothing that norman does n't already know .
what 'd you say to him ?
about the time paradox . how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
what was that , sir ?
that whole time -- i could n't stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier ...
they 're in the sub , sir . waiting .
beth and harry ?
the others , sir ?
how are the others ?
they 're topside . we 're ready to take you home , sir .
the ships ?
it 's over , sir , the storm has cleared .
does this mean what i think it means ?
norman johnson .
told me what ?
you mean they have n't told you yet ?
what report ?
by the way sir , i 've read your report . i think it 's brilliant .
really ?
barnes . he 's very eager to meet you . been calling us every half hour to see if you 're arrived .
captain who ?
captain barnes wants to see you right away , sir .
this way , sir .
no , they did n't say --
no other equipment ? scientific instruments ?
just that . careful , it 's heavy .
any other bags , dr. johnson ?
what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash ?
strange , is n't it ? in the middle of the ocean no less .
geologists ? at a plane crash ?
physicists , mathematicians , geologists , you name it .
who 's everyone ?
must be another johnson then . been flying so many scientists out here -- ca n't keep everyone straight .
know what ?
you mean you do n't know ?
what report ?
huh ?
what report ?
well , everybody 's been talking about that report you wrote .
you 've heard of me ?
oh , so you 're that dr. johnson .
i 'm in psychology . was . still am really , just been a while . i treat aircrash survivors .
of course he did . he 's been isloated for 400 years . he wants someone to talk to . look , you put a human being in isolation for four days , they can become neurotic , sometimes psychotic . we 're talking about 400 years here . an alien that shows emotional responses . i think we need to address him , before he reacts further .
jerry is n't hostile , norman . he said earlier -- we were his friends --
i 'm not sure .
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds ? with what 's out there ?
not that i know of . why ?
has harry spoken with jerry ?
barnes did n't know . could n't get a reading .
what was it ?
why 's that ?
frankly , ted , i 'd be much happier if jerry was just a cold , emotionless intellect .
when he uses a phrase like `` i am happy '' , i think we should think twice about what we ask him .
you want to put him on your couch , norman . grill him about his childhood ?
unless it 's an act .
well , he 's polite .
sure , why not . give him the trophy . that pretentious son of a bitch . you heard him , norman . all that `` someone went to a lot of trouble , try again '' bullshit . and `` impotent '' . where does he get off saying i 'm impotent ? he 's a fucking self-righteous , little prick .
well , how about we wait and see what harry comes up with ?
inside the sphere . look , that 's the vertical torso , three legs , two arms . there 's no head , so i 'm guessing the creature 's head is located within the torso itself , you know ?
the creature ?
do n't you see it ? it 's a picture of the creature .
this is like nursery school .
try this one .
please , ted .
squint harder .
i do n't see anything .
take a look . i rearranged the numbers . put 'em up to the light . go ahead . squint at it .
you mean a picture ?
it 's not some fucking substitution code , it 's a direct visual representation .
like what ?
he 's manic , norman . you know that ? this reliance on harry is misplaced . you hear me ? totally misplaced . he 's overlooking things . obvious things .
still , make a note i recognized that .
earth does n't have a patent on buttons , ted .
strange , is n't it ? you know -- how it would have a button .
you 're a 53 year old shrink , what are you gon na do ?
you want me to try ?
he 's a pussy .
he was n't feeling well .
they never used to send a navy car .
i do n't know .
was it a military crash ?
what ?
there 's a u.s. navy car outside , norman .
how are you getting to the airport ? you need money for the bus ?
keep watching the news . are you watching the news ?
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume .
four . four years --
well , i ca n't imagine five years of unemployment --
do n't be so supportive , honey .
in the closet . i do n't understand , norman -- why would they call you ?
he did n't say much at all . honey --
there 's nothing on the news about a crash . did he say what airline ?
you seen my suitcase ?
what kind of a crash was it ?
may the force be with you .
we 'll be back before you are , old man .
that 's straight through the central core ... up toward the top of the city ... once you 've got her , avoid the main transports , they 'll shut down immediately . your only chance is through the service shafts . there are no sensors there ... all right now , get going , you do n't have time . i hope you can remember everything .
i 'm not going out there .
there is a greater risk in staying here , you know . if you do n't find the princess , then the whole trip was for nothing ... was n't it ?
do n't look at me . i 'm just a pilot . i got you here ... you 've got to do the rest .
it 's not good ... unless i could find the crystal . then it could be very good .
is that good or bad ?
darth vader is on this system . i can feel him . i can feel the kiber crystal .
what do you want with our scan-proof lockers ?
... and i want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments .
i 'll get the information .
all right then , we 'll use your plan .
we 're going to get in by studying imperial procedures ? i do n't like it .
check your data banks for all the information you have on imperial procedures . both of you will have to learn ...
we 're into the second perimeter . they 'll be coming out to blast us shortly . i was wondering if you had some kind of a plan or are we going to try to blast our way in ?
not bad .
you have your father 's style . you 've done very well .
i 'm not afraid of anything ...
fear is their greatest weapon .
kid , you take the glory and the good intentions and i 'll take the reward .
this is n't a game , you know .
luke 's got a point ... ... fear is their greatest defense ... i doubt if the actual security there is much greater than on aquilae or sullust , and what there is is most likely directed toward large-scale assault .
anything i want ! now that 's interesting .
a million at least ... if this robot has information related to the destruction of organa major , you 'll be able to name the reward ...
how much do you think she 's talking about ?
i 'm beginning not to like you .
i think there are some things we should talk about .
who 's going to pay me then ?
well , for one reason , we do n't have your other five thousand .
i 'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy ... i was only paid to get you here and now you 're here . i 'll take my other five thousand and you 're on your own ... i 'll leave you on the nearest system .
no , not anymore .
their bases are very well hidden . all the power of the empire ca n't find them ... do you know where they are ?
we have to find he rebels ... what we 're carrying belongs to them .
well , i 've brought you here . what now ?
well , now you know ... the enemy is on the move . we have n't much time .
the planet has been totally blown away ! it would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than i 've ever seen ... if the empire had a new weapon that could do this ... i would have heard something ... i 'd know about it .
the empire must have gotten here first .
you might get your stuff together . we 'll be coming up on organa major soon .
well , we 'll see ...
i 'm ben kenobi . luke starkiller here is leading our expedition .
i 'm han solo , captain of this vessel . who 's in charge then ?
keep it with you always . you 'll have more need of it than i. it will bring the force to you . you 've already learned to feel it ... now you must learn to use it .
the kiber crystal .
i 'm not going alone !
you go after the princess . i am an old man and would be of little help . i must try to find the crystal .
what about the princess ?
i do n't get it , but i guess i did block it .
see , once you let yourself go you can do it . you 'll get it .
stop thinking , and start feeling . let yourself go .
i ca n't do it . i 'll get hit .
try to feel it . use the force ...
i ca n't see ! how can i fight ?
i did n't say that , but it appears to be a logical alternative .
you mean we should go after her ! ...
but she is the only link between us and the hidden bases .
he ca n't find organa major .
what is it ?
all you have to do is lose your thinking self . do n't focus on anything . let your body do your thinking ... you have to learn to act on what you feel , not what you think ... if i had the crystal , it would be much easier . you could feel the force immediately ... but for now , let yourself go . you 'll pick it up ... and someday you 'll have no need for that pistol either .
what do i do ?
i rarely use it any more . i have the force . the force is more powerful than any pistol . you should n't put too much faith in that weapon . work on becoming aware of the force ... learn to feel its presence within you . try to sense what it 's telling you . it 's the only thing you can rely on .
are you sure you do n't need it ?
yes ... the force ... something horrible has happened . i could n't see what it was , or where it was , but it was terrible ... terrible beyond description ... the cry of millions dying at once .
are you all right ?
keep away , i 'm fine , i 'm fine .
what 's wrong ? what 's happening ?
these are doubtful times . the empire has grown bold in its disregard of the ...
but she 's a member of the twelve families . how can they hold her ?
i doubt it . it would be foolish for the rebel forces to come out of hiding . i know your feelings . you 'd best forget them . it 's for your own good . there will be no saving her from the prisons of alderaan . it 's the heart of the sith . the bogan force is the most heavy there .
when we get artoo 's message to them , you think they 'll try to rescue the princess ?
he 's bluffing ...
this is the last place . should n't we just take what we can get and think of something else ?
five , maybe . let me handle it .
we do n't have that kind of money . how much do you think i can get for the speeder ?
there are two halves of the force of others . one is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it . but the others half will kill you if you are n't careful . this negative side of the force is called the bogan , which is where the expression came from , and it is the part that is used by the dark lords to destroy their opponents . both halves are always present . the force is on your right , the bogan is on your left . the kiber crystal can amplify either one . the crystal darth stole was the last one in the possession of the jedi . when he joined the sith , the power of the dark lords was completed .
like bogan weather , or bogan times . i thought that was just a saying .
they use the bogan force .
do the sith know the ways of the force ?
yes . it was a black day . one of my disciple 's took the crystal and became a sith lord . it was a black day . the few crystals that remain are in the possession of the sith lords on alderaan . that 's how they 've become so powerful .
that 's where my father was killed .
i had one , but it was taken at the battle of condawn ...
do n't you have a kiber crystal ?
when a creature dies , the force it generated remains . the force is all around us . it can be collected and transmitted through the use of a kiber crystal . it 's the only way to amplify the power of the force within you .
how can you store an energy field within you ?
a jedi 's power is measured by the amount of the force that is stored within him , and i have little of the force left in me .
but you 're still a powerful jedi . you do n't need my help .
luke , i 'm coming along to do what i can , but i 'm tired and i 'm depending on you to get us through .
it means you 'd better get some rest . we 'll be leaving for mos eisley first thing in the morning . the trip will be difficult and dangerous , but it 's the only spaceport with ships large enough to get us to organa major . now go on !
what do you mean ?
that is not a human decision , not your or mine .
could i learn to feel it ?
it surrounds you and radiates from you . a jedi can feel it flowing from him ... ... from here !
you mean i generate an energy field ?
let 's just say the force is something a jedi warrior deals with . it is an energy field in oneself , a power that controls ones acts , yet obeys ones commands . it is nothing , yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes . all living things generate this force field , even you .
my father used to talk about the force of others . but he never told me what it was ...
you were right . it is my responsibility . the force of others brought the message to you and then it brought you to me .
not any more !
but the sith lords are involved ! whatever information this r-2 unit is carrying , it must be awfully important . they 're probably looking for him ... i 'm no match for the sith . this is a jedi 's work . this is your responsibility !
i already know you think you 're worthless . i recommend you learn to think of yourself in a better light , for what you believe you are is what you become . i have n't been involved in anything like this for many years .
but you must ! i ca n't do it alone . i 'm not at all like my father . i 'd never make it .
i 'm afraid i 've gotten too old for this sort of thing .
my father told me many stories about you . he said if i was ever in trouble , to come here ... i need your help .
i know your intentions . i probably know much more about you than you realize . in many ways you 're a lot like your father . he was an indulgent man , but a clever warrior . now what brings you out here ?
i assure you my intentions were n't bad .
you could put it that way .
you saw through me ?
i know that .
i ... i 'm not a bendu officer . i 'm not even a startrooper .
but you are ... i know your 'diary of the clone wars ' by heart . my father ...
i know who you are . stand up so that we can talk properly . you 're embarrassing me . i 'm not that important .
i am the son of annikin starkiller .
i do n't see why . i do n't believe we 've ever met .
i 'm afraid it 's been a long time since the white legions roamed the stars . but i have the memories .
you 're general kenobi ? ! ? the jedi knight ! the commander of the white legions ?
you might say i 'm part of the landscape here . they call me ben kenobi .
who are you anyway ?
of course . i 'm a bendu officer .
oh , so you 're a warrior then ?
i 'm luke starkiller , guardian of the bendu .
you 're lucky those tuskens did n't boil you before they hung you out to dry . they 're not the friendly sort . you 'd best be moving on before they come back .
could n't we have tried to think of something else first !
sorry , but that was the only way to get you down .
all of them altogether . you seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess ! what happened ?
what do you mean , 'good morning ' ? do you mean that it is a good morning for you , or do you wish me a good morning , although it is obvious i 'm not having one , or do you find that mornings in general are good ?
good morning !
just be warned , that things are n't always as they seem ... especially the starforce recruiting posters .
at least you 're doing something ... i 'd give anything to be in your position .
the academy is fantastic ... of course , they wo n't teach you anything about flying you do n't already know . most of the instructors are very conservative pilots . you can fly circles around them ... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing , and you get a lot of discipline ... but after you graduate , do n't join the star force -- go free-lance . it 's the only way to get into the action ... i ca n't wait until my hitch is up .
but you always said things were so great at the academy ... what happened ?
i 'll tell you , luke , and this is between you and me . the star force is n't all it 's cracked up to be . frankly , it 's a bore , and it 's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral ...
but there was a lot of firing earlier ...
that 's no battle , kid ... they 're just sitting there !
you look great ! the uniform and everything !
of course , where you been kid ?
forget it , son .
yes , sir , but i can get him ...
blue five , break off your cover attack . it 's too late . make your own run on the exhaust port . do you copy , luke ?
what 's that ?
i 'm right behind you , blue leader .
i 've got it blocked . i 'm all right .
blue five , does that glare bother you ?
yes , sir .
six hours , huh ? well , that 's your ship there . you 're blue five . you stay glued to me . i do n't want any independent operations out there . personally i think it 's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this . this is no joy ride we 're going on .
yes , sir . i was considered one of the best bush pilots on sullust . i 've also had six hours on the t-2 .
have you been checked out ?
yes , sir .
you 're starkiller ?
send out a boarding party . full assault gear .
we do n't get many visitors . let 's take a look at it .
send one squad up .
as close as we can make out , it appears to be a corellian gypsy vessel ... it 's not under power .
i 'll make a report later .
should we alert the sith lords ?
alert squad five , but hold them until we know what it is .
no reply on any circuits ... it 's drifting on a point twenty-seven skew . it 's not close enough to identify .
i have little time for your mercenary concerns , but i am grateful for the service you have given to our cause . what is your price ?
what about us ? are we to wait forever ? is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system , while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that death star ? part of my reward is that i be around to spend it .
i 'd like to get paid before that eventually . i do n't plan to stick around for the fireworks .
we must hurry to the base . we have little time before the death star arrives .
did it occur to you they might find us ?
i do n't see how we 're going to find anything out here . this terrain is hopeless .
i 'd better go see how he 's doing .
the fourth moon of yavin . i 've given the coordinates to chewbacca .
where are you taking us now anyway ?
we captured the plans in a raid on the imperial shipyards , but we fell under attack before i could get the data to safety , so i hid it in this artoo unit and sent him off .
the plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system ... our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness , which we will determine from the data i stored in artoo .
what 's that little 'droid ' carrying that 's so blasted important ?
when artoo has been safely delivered to my forces , you get your reward . you have my guarantee .
then i think we 're due the reward you offered ... and it had better be substantial after what we 've been through .
all the data banks in artoo are still secure .
chewbacca , it 's time we showed them this is n't the regulation f8-88 cargo trawler .
there are only three or four left .
was this trip really necessary ?
here come six more ... grid two !
it could be worse ...
yes , your highness . i 'll let you open it then . it wo n't be too long before they figure out what happened to us . this has turned into a brilliant escape !
put that thing away or you 're going to get us all killed .
thanks , old buddy . i 'll be with you in a second .
i noticed you were having some problems , blue five ... i thought i 'd help .
i know , but the chances for survival here just are n't great enough in my book . i 've got what i came for . now i 've got to get back to my ship .
you 're a good pilot ... i 've learned a lot from you ... i wish you ...
well , if it 's not , we 'll be facing that death star all by our lonesome .
they must be shielded somehow . i 'm sure the base is there .
i do n't pick up any life form concentration down there . she 'd better be right .
come back here ... where are you going ?
get to the ship !
move out of the way !
it 's only light that does n't affect it . solid things , like rocks , can hurt it ! fire above him !
get chewbacca . try to get around it . i 'll draw it away .
watch it ! move back .
no , he smells something ... but we have n't time to worry about it now .
is he afraid of the water ?
not if this tunnel deadends .
i think she 's going to be all right .
see threepio , come in , see threepio . i wonder where they are ? ? see threepio ...
let 's try this way ! holy maker .
something has happened to them . let 's try this way ...
i think i did .
why did n't you say so before .
this is n't going to work .
good ! i prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around .
between his howling and your blasting everything in sight , the entire city is going to know we 're here .
i do n't know ... i 've never fought anyone .
you 're good with 'remotes , ' but how are you against something living ?
well , i practice a lot ...
do n't you believe it .
maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us . they probably do n't think anyone would dare try .
no , it 's impossible ... no one , and i mean no one would venture anywhere near the alderaan system ... i 'm a free booter , not revolutionary . you 're aboard the wrong ship , son !
all right , all right ! you 've got a ship ! but where do we go from here ? they probably took her to find the hidden bases ... i do n't see how we can find the rebels before she breaks . the empire has already beat us out .
maybe you should just drop us off . i 'm sure we can find someone willing to take the risk .
why ?
you ca n't ! we 've come this far . we must find them ...
what are you saying ?
i found it ... it 's just not there .
sorcery ! i believe in myself ... i determine my destiny , not some mystical energy field .
you do n't believe in the force ?
i 'd keep that thing close just in case , if i were you ... i 've been around from one end of the galaxy to the other and believe me this force of others stuff may make for good religion , but there is no substitute for a good weapon at your side .
it 's automatic .
who 's the pilot ?
we have a little business to take care of first , but it should n't take long . we 'll be back shortly .
you got yourself a ship . we can leave as soon as you 're ready .
that 's pretty steep . we 'd like to talk it over first .
organa major is a rebel system . there will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there ... it could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them ... ten thousand .
who is this ? what 's your operating ...
the ... ah door 's jammed . give us a few minutes to get it fixed .
with four casualties ? !
no need , everything 's under control .
we 'll send a squad up .
a wookiee broke loose up here , but we 've subdued him ... there is a lot of damage , and three , no four , casualties ...
it would be much easier if you were to tell us where the outposts are ... otherwise we 'll be forced to destroy every suspicious system ... what a waste ...
no ! ...
it 's too late ... we already tested it on organa major . it appears your data never got through .
they 'll find its weakness .
the 'death star ' has become operational . there is no force in the universe that can stop us now .
it appears your ship had an accident . i will see to it that your death is duely reported . there will be no one to save you this time .
you 'll get no information from me . you have no authority ... the council ca n't hold me !
enough ! i already know about the data you 've intercepted , but its ' too late . whatever information you 've gathered will be destroyed ... you will come to know such suffering as only the master of the bogan force can provide ...
if you 're as good a pilot as you are a swordsman ... we 're the ones who have been rewarded .
i ... i do n't know . i guess i never thought about it ... i just want to help . i want to be in on the attack . i want my own ship .
and you ?
he 'll be well cared for .
are there medical facilities on yavin ?
there 'll be time for that later . now let 's get out of here .
i am luke starkiller at your service .
you 're safe . we 've come to get you out of here ... just relax .
what is it ? what 's going on ? where are we ?
your father 's dead . do n't ever forget who 's taking care of you , giving you food , giving you shelter , and giving you the allowance in the first place . if you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here , you wo n't last very long . i do n't want another word . finish your dinner , then finish cleaning those 'droids . '
you used my savings ! you stole my savings . if my father were here ...
i said we 'd see . and as it is , i was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids . ' when you 've saved it up again , i 'll let you go .
but you promised ! i 've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised !
you 'll check the condensing unit first ... and you 're not going to bed until those 'droids ' are completely cleaned up ...
i will , but i 'll have enough time to transmit my application first .
first thing tomorrow morning you 're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge .
i 'd consider it an honor .
thank you , sir . your kindness is greatly appreciated , but if it 's at all possible , artoo and i would like to remain in your service .
threepio ! shut down all garbage mashers on your level ... do you copy ? ? threepio , shut down all garbage ...
are you there , sir ? we 're going ...
holy maker , threepio . i forgot ...
see threepio ! do you copy ?
wait a minute , slow down ! ... that 's better . they 're where ? they what ? they are ? oh , no ! we 're going to be mashed into conduit before this is over ...
good . we 're right above you . stand by .
for the moment . we 're in the main hangar . artoo is trying to plug into the system now .
are you safe ?
i 'm afraid we 're not plugged in at the moment , sir . we 've had some problems .
you 're back . what happened ? never mind . what 's going on ?
i read you sir .
see threepio ... do you copy ?
send feed-back into the control sensors in that detention block .
level five , detention block a-23 , cell 2187. she 's still alive ...
i know , sir , but it 's the principle of the thing .
let him have it . you 're winning anyway . it does n't make any difference .
well , ask him . tell him we need five thousand .
sir , i have a couple of extra circuits . perhaps they might bring something .
i think we 're going to need them . blast it !
no , you 're not . what kind of talk is that ...
i ca n't make it . you go on , master luke . it does n't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account . i 'm done for .
can you stand ? we 've got to get out of here before those tuskens come back .
what happened ? i 'm sorry , sir , i must have taken a bad step ...
well , i do n't know what to do now . we 'll just have to head inland and see if we ca n't find a settlement .
if you do n't mind my saying so , sir , i do n't see how anyone could live in this forsaken place .
according to my father 's tapes , this is the spot where general kenobi lives , but the instruments just do n't match up with the landscape ... there is no doubt about it , we 're lost ...
several , i think . there is not much to tell . i 'm not much more than an interpreter , and not very good at telling stories , not at making them interesting anyway ...
tell me where you 've been . i am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars . my father was a jedi ! were you in many battles ?
that 's how we came to be in your service , if you take my meaning ...
you 've been in the counter wars ? ... against the empire ?
indeed , sir , sometimes i 'm amazed we 're in as good shape as we are , what with the rebellion and all ...
there 's a lot of carbon scoring here . it looks like you boys have seen a lot of action ...
thank you , sir . i 'm see threepio , human cyborg relations , and this is my counterpart , artoo detoo .
that 's all right . there is nothing anyone can do about it . you can call me luke .
i 'm sorry , sir , i 'm only a 'droid , ' and not very knowledgeable of such things ... not on this system anyway . as a matter of fact , i 'm not even sure which system we 're on .
not unless you could get me into the military academy at anchorhead .
you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce , troopers !
saddle up , roughnecks !
yes , sir !
mr. barcalow , save power , do n't waste it on workers ... ace , tell aardvark we 're on our way ...
down there on the flats , eh ? listen up , roughnecks ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet ...
got it . fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers .
we 'll take this high ground . lookouts there and therte and up there . if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood , we 'll be the first to know .
we 're the old men , ace .
we got reinforced . most of'em just got outa boot ...
not enough , i guess .
jeez , we musta killed a million already ... !
what about it , diz ?
no way . big k taught me i ai n't executive material .
yeah , well , i hear he 's a real nutbuster .
he was our teacher ... he was great .
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires ...
i did n't see him !
lieutenant 's bought the farm . where 's the sarge ... ?
death to all bugs !
mobile infantery rules !
yaaaaaaaa !
no , this hurts .
what do i want with a scar ?
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together .
you made squad leader on your own , and , hey , you still got me to kick around .
i joined up for her . i would n't even be here if it was n't for her . i 'm a fool .
whad'ya talkin about ?
it 's what i deserve .
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out .
bye ! write me ! i 'm gon na kill you guys !
our love will grow , dear , year by year ...
well , maybe you better look again .
oh , yeah ? i do n't see anyone else here with the chops to lead .
wanting it does n't make you the best one for the job .
it is n't about rich ... it 's about who 's best ... !
you rich kids ... are all the same !
something ... i 've got ... you do n't .
what makes you think ... you 'll make ... squad leader , rico ?
hey , do n't laugh . everyone oughta have a friend like me !
what an honor ...
you got some guts for a rich kid . i guess you and me could be buddies .
sir , i know it was wrong . i did n't learn from one mistake and i made another , sir . sir , my family ... my whole family was in buenos aires , sir .
sorry , son . i ca n't do it . you signed the 1240/a . it would be illegal .
sir , i wish to reconsider my request to drop out , sir .
sir ... i guess i do , sir .
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
sir , i needed everyone in my squad operational , sir ... i ... i wanted to win , sir .
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
sir , no , sir .
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit , rico ?
sir , yes , sir . breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction , and i asked him to show it to me , sir .
rico , did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
i ca n't ... but like i told you , it 's a number 's game . the federation needs all the pilots it can get ...
you always told me you could n't do human ...
i 'll take it ... until i get killed or you find someone better .
i hear they need a new lieutenant ... want the job ?
the roughnecks are always ready , sir .
hope you 're ready for more . we 're going back to p to capture that brain .
did n't they tell you , colonel ? that 's what cap troopres are good for .
you do n't approve . well , too bad . we 're in this for the species , boys and girls . it 's simple numbers , they have more , and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths .
elegant proof of intelligence , is n't it ? we thought there might be a brain on p .
bugs laid a trap , did n't they ?
johnny , i 'm sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability ...
dizzy would n't want our tears . she 'd want us to remember her ... with a vengeance . so go out and kill a bug for dizzy . kill as many as you can . you are her revenge , and every bug you kill honors her death .
please continue , sergeant .
i got games & theory .
i do n't believe it !
love ... how excruciatingly pathetic . now try and pay attention .
all i know is carmen 's going to be a citizen , and i do n't think it 'll work out for us if i 'm not .
if you ca n't do those numbers , you have n't got a chance .
eight point ... no , uh , seven ...
only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation . so what do you think your chances are ?
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision , i think i 'd make a pretty good pilot . i 've good great reflexes . you need that for maneuvering , you know .
your father will never let you .
i 've been thinking about applying for federal service , too . fleet , maybe .
passport to the universe . who would n't want that ?
ten of clubs . you still gon na sign up for starside r & d ?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom 's leg . he is going to go eat it .
how do you make him do that ?
in addition to `` psychic dolt '' this test also proves i 'm unlucky ? two of hearts .
statistically speaking you should 've accidentally guessed right by know .
ace of spades .
do n't think about it ... go on instinct .
you got it bad .
yeah , but i want carmen .
do n't have to ... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss .
did you read her mind ?
others are waiting .
what 's the hurry ?
you still have n't kissed her yet ? do n't lie .
zander , no ... !
just giving you something to remember me by , baby .
zander , what are you doing ?
is it true ?
it was n't luck . rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you ...
i thought i was dead . lucky for me you jokers showed up , eh ?
i do .
i do n't know , zander .
how do you feel about him now ?
yeah .
that girl who died on the way up ... his girl ?
a funeral .
where are you going ?
you 're upset , that 's alright .
no , i ... oh , zander , i 'm a fool .
please , i ... everybody 's lost someone by now . this should n't be any different ...
i 'm sorry , carmen .
excuse me ... !
carmen ... ?
hey , bugs do n't take prisoners .
no , funny there 's almost no wounded at all .
i 'm not kidding . marriage is -
funny ...
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers . you 'd probably get a promotion out of it .
so who 's got time to get married ?
so ?
there 's a war on . i want a command , i want my own ship , you do , too ...
if we 're gon na be a team , why not be a real team ?
you were n't thinking ... you were dreaming !
i was thinking . maybe we should get married , carmen .
zander , please ... let 's go !
let 's disregaed rank ... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here .
forget it , carmen . the mobile infantery does a thankless , dirty job , so they naturally tend to be short-tempered , thoughtless and rude .
johnny , wait ...
zander , you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now .
everything coposetic , lieutenant ?
it looks like an ... asteroid .
there ! gravity field ... it 's big !
where is it ?
me , too ... day and night-cycle .
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet ...
you and me , huh ?
she got a command ... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her . she thinks we 're good together .
do n't mess with the boss . so what 'd the captain say ?
well , whad'ya know ...
do n't change the subject . am i right ?
you know i was talking to captain , deladier , and she said ...
hey , check it .
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all , huh ?
no , i replotted the course . it 's more efficient this way .
profile 's wrong ... there .
oh , i do n't know ... depends on who you are spending it with .
thanks . you read my mind . third watch always seems to last forever .
oh , i see ... teamwork .
they revoke our flight status .
or ... ?
twenty-five by five , roll seven . and do n't exceed port speed .
oh , yes , sir . vector ?
this is n't simulation anymore . take'er out easy , cadet .
in simulation , my supervisors could never keep up .
maybe not . i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy , solid math , a little wild on the stick , but a natural . when it turned out it was you , i made sure we 'd run into each other ...
it 's amazing , us running into each other like this . maybe it 's fate .
only when i give you an order .
assistant insructor ... you must be some kind of a hot stick . should i call you `` sir '' ?
i 'm the guy who 's gon na teach you to fly this crate .
hey ! what are you doing here ?
yeah , we know each other from the game . no hard feeling , eh , chum ?
johnny , this is zander .
do n't you have to finish the game ?
i 'm all ears .
i do n't know . it 's my last night as acivilian . i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow .
everyone is going to the dance . are n't you ?
so what are you doing later ?
i 'm getting better .
are you alright ?
up . we got ta be near a company by now .
which way ?
we 've got ta go get her !
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !

take care , wilya johnny ?
how are you , carl ?
well , look at this . the three of us back together again .
i like it . it 's kinda ... you .
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k .
what happened to your eye ?
you look so ... i do n't know , you look like you 've really been in it .
that was just a mix up .
i thought you were kia , johnny ...
no , i think something 's up . the sky marshall 's here .
we got ta choke on the mud and the blood and fleet ca n't be bothered to spit .
... i 'm sorry .
i 'm not , but alot of my soldiers are . glass the planet !
johnny ... ! i thought you were dead !
hey , it 's just a vestigal response to procreation ... bitch .
what 's wrong with you ?
johnny ... life is so different from the way it was . one day you 'll see what i did was best for both of us .
should i be ?
you do n't look very happy to see me .
i try just to be happy i 'm still alive .
it 's funny . sometimes i forget . then it hits me , and i ca n't stop crying .
it 's alright , i guess . you hear from anyone made it out of b.a . alive ?
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings . you do n't like it , do you ?
what happened to your hair ?
i 'm glad you 're doing so well . if they have n't made you squad leader by now , i 'm sure you will .
shhhh ... !
i said it . is n't that enough ? do n't forget to write !
do you mean it ?
alright , i love you .
com'on , just say it . try it on for size .
i love you .
i 'll miss you , too , johnny .
i 'm gon na miss you .
he left this morning . he could n't say where .
you talk to carl ?
who cares ! the federation 'll give me everything i need for the next two years , right ?
poor boy . i 'm sorry your parents were so mad .
my dad had to help me pack . suddenly he 's afraid he 's never gon na see me again or something . it was sweet , but it took forever . anyway , i guess i 'm ready to go .
you 're late .
i 'll go for that .
let 's all make a vow . let 's swear we 'll always be friends no matter what .
whoa ! way to go , boy-yo !
games & theory ? that 's military intelligence ... oh , carl !
did you get starside r & d ?
hey , carl , what 's wrong ?
shhh ! do n't make him feel worse .
he was in the group with me . i guess he did n't ...
naw , i made it , carl made it .
i wonder where carl is . you do n't suppose ... ?
shhh ...
i love you , carmen .
you 're right . let 's never stop ...
who cares ?
everyone 's looking ... we should n't ...
i 'm gon na do it , carmen . i 'm gon na sign up for federal service .
are you the boy for me ?
i do n't even know if you 're my girl .
he 's nothing like you .
i ca n't help it .
johnny rico , you 're jealous !
you two have so much in common .
zander is going for pilot , too .
what are you talking about ? we both know you 're gon na be a pilot .
no , i mean if he can get in , maybe i have a chance .
yeah , sure , i guess .
he just got accepted to the fleet academy . is n't that great ?
good luck at the academy .
none at all ... we won .
i 'll meet you outside .
wait , i want to talk to mr. rasczak .
aw , you 're in love with me ... you just dont know it yet .
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation ...
it would n't be so romantic if we were n't ...
how do i know if this is love ?
is n't it great to be in love ?
sometimes i do what i want , eh ?
well , if your dad does n't like me , how come we 're such good friends ?
it 's not you , johnny . your parents are rich they do n't need to be citizens , and that stuff means a lot to my dad . he 's a veteran .
what 's he got against me ... i mean , i 'm a teenager . you ca n't be a citizen when you 're only a teenager !
johnny , my dad 's home today .
carl can wait .
i thought you were going to help carl .
why not ?
you ca n't walk me home .
it 's all i think about anymore .
how come that 's all you talk about anymore ?
why wo n't you kiss me when we 're all alone ?
i do n't want everyone to see .
then how come you wo n't hold hands with me at school ?
do n't be so sure . i like you even if you are dumb with numbers .
who cares about bugs ? you ca n't go anywhere if you do n't know math .
well , at least you did n't lose your lunch over a bug . how embarassing .
35 % on the math final ! no one could be that dumb with numbers .
excuse me ... !
well , if that 's the crop , that must be the gastric caecal ...
aw , c'mon , it 's just a bug .
eeuch !
i have good reflexes .
marco 's sister . can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes ... you got ta have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical
who ?
she 's flying starships !
your turn ...
good for you .
no way , ma'am !
leave me , lieutenant ! that 's an order !
ibanez ... let 's go !
this is rodger young , we 're going down ... repeat , this is rodger young , we 're going down ... !
he requested a combat assignment . there 's always a need for experienced pilots on the ground . i had no choice but to let him go ... he said you 'd understand .
where 's lieutenant barcalow ?
bug batteries ... according to military intelligence , it 'll be random and light . drop status ?
plasma , ma'am ... from the planet .
thank you , ma'am .
good work , number 1. you 'll do .
yes , ma'am .
alright , take her out , ibanez .
yes , ma'am !
take the number one chair , ibanez . follow all instructions of you supervisor .
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty , ma'am .
that 's it , we 're empty ma'am !
this is n't random or light . someone made amistake ... !
number 4 , contact fleet and tell 'em there 's a loose asteroid headed their way .
trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone .
where 'd it come from ?
captain , we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed ...
report .
yes , ma'am . star drive in three ... two ... one ...
steady as she goes , number one . prepare for warp . number two , design for jupiter orbit .
it 's alright 'cause i got to have you , johnny ...

planet p ? what kind of name is that ?

hey , diz ...
well , excuse me , sir ...
i said no . want me to pull rank ?
you used to dance ...
nah , i do n't do that anymore ...
c'mon ...
i 'm gon na need a squad leader .
way to go , amigo !
that you do n't have what it takes to be acitizen !
what 's that , diz ?
you take the stroll down washout lane , you 're only proving one thing , johnny .
well , see ya .
hey , they humiliated me in front of everyone ! i 'm just supposed to take it , huh ? well , i 'm not gon na , and i guess that proves i just ca n't cut it .
if they did n't want you , they woulda kicked you out , amigo .
i do n't stay where i 'm not wanted .
it stinks , you goin .

cover me .
high school ... remember ? run a flip six , three hole play , and you might score ...
what ?
flip six , three hole .
man , they 're defended ... no way in .
you saying you did n't ?
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
you are . i joined up to get out on my own . and you had to tag along .
what 's your malfunction , rico ?
no thanks , diz .
hey , amigo , come chow with me .
you 're the best .
guess you got ta go .
uh , look , diz ...

ca n't we just be friends , diz ?
how come we never got together ?
well , anyone who gets you is lucky .

hey , rico , wan na dance ?
just throw me the ball , diz .
you were drifting . flip six , three hole . on one , got it ?

hut ... hut !
a lot can happen in three minutes .

looks like rain .
oh , my , what 's that ?
yeah ! we 'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and ... well , we love you , son .
we 'll all have dinner . i 'll fix your favorite .
do n't talk like that . get yourself home as fast as you can .
johnny , why wo n't you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
... cut off !
teenagers !
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go zegema beach !
a year at harvard and you 'll see this `` federal service '' is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves `` citizens '' and take airs for the rest of their lives .
good good , then it 's all settled .
who gave you this idea ? it 's that teacher . what 's his name ? you know the one i mean .
johnny , people get hurt ... people get killed in the federal service . if something happened to you i do n't know what i would do ...
it 's not really working out for me here , dad . i was thinking ... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home .
well , it 's just good to hear from you . what 's up , son ?
i 'm not going on vacation ! i want to be acitizen ! it 's my decision . i made it .
i 'm telling you , you will ! you 're not going back . you 're going to go on vacation !
i wo n't quit !
you 'll resign , and that 's all there is to it . it might look bad , but if that 's the worst you suffer ...
sorry . carl 's a fine boy ...
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he is n't inferior . he 's the smartest kid at school !
wow ! santori and zegema beach , i 've always wanted to go there .
a trip to the outer rings . whad'ya think of that ?
oh , is that how it is ?
i 'm eighteen . it 's my decision .
good , because you 're going to harvard , and that 's the end of it .
no , mr. rasczak does n't do that at all . he sorta discourages you really .
rasczak ... silly name . there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
mr. rasczak .
it 's aterm of service , not a career . i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years .
have you lost you lost your mind ? i 'd rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life .
a lot of my friends are doing federal service ...
this came for you today . i presume on your request .
aaaaaaaaaaa !
gillespie , put in call for retrieval . we 're off this rock . gillespie , do you read me ?
keep trying , sergeant .
i do n't understand it , lieutenant . it 's not getting anything from 4th brigade ... not even their transponder .
they 'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships . who 's got the nuke ?
fleet 's pulling the battle group back to safe distance ... they 'd like us to knock out those batteries , sir .
corporal , i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams , spread out along the ridge ! sugar , bring up that flame thrower !
yes , sir ! fleet , this is roughneck patrol , over ... ?
we must be right over the colony . let 's get some air support , eh ?
bugs do n't lay traps ... they are n't intelligent ! unlike you , they 're stupid enough to follow orders !
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs , major , and if you 're walking me into a trap-
take your group down to p and have a look see . leave the thinking to us , lieutenant . that 's not your job .
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed ...
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago . that 's why micom wants onsite assessment .
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p .
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p , priority code , requesting reinforcement ...
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared .
geez , i do n't think i 've ever seen him smile .
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all ... always had this little smile .
you knew the lieutenant before the war ... what was he like ?
good luck . it 's not there anymore .
i always wanted to go to zegema beach .
i would n't mind .
are you kidding ? they always get killed . you want the job ?
seeing as how we 're about all that 's left of 1st brigade , you 'd have to call that an improvement . you top kick ?
does n't look like it to me .
sir , yes it is , sir .
is that your signature , rico ?
sir , yes , sir !
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury , but if you are hit , you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly . rico , has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
do n't stand there dumb ... go !
sir , thank you , sir !
smith , go ! mcintire , go ! flores , go ! rico , i 'm making you sqaud leader !
i want to be a citizen because ... well , because of my girl , sir .
please complete this sentence . i want to be citizen because ...
courage , i guess .
which do you think is more important , courage or confidence ?
no , sir .
are your parents currently citizens ?
here in buenos aires .
no talking please . i 'm going to ask you some questions . please answer all questions truthfully . we 'll know if you do n't . birthplace ?
i 've made a mess of things . i 've been so stupid ...
well , of course you should come home immedietly !
bill ... pick up ... it 's johnny ! you little rat . you have n't called , you have n't written . it 's been so lonely here without you ...
hi , mom .
hello ... oh , johnny ... !
i hope so . i hope you do n't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform .
well , yeah , sure ...
well , that 's what you 're saying ! you 're saying that i 'm not good enough the way i am now !
johnny , please . calm yourself .
i do n't know what they teach at harvard , but i think i 'm pretty good enough the way i am !
uh , no .
wait you two . dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this . can you guess what it is ?
aw , do n't get mushy .
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old . you had such a bright little face ...
this is my farm . now c'mon , give me what you got and get out of here ...
do n't be a hero ...
nah , i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it 's too late ... gimmee the nuke .
alright , we 're gon na carry you ...
been better , buddy .
how bad are you , pal ?
let 's get some armor on her , and the we 'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
not a problem .
can you walk ?
move out .
let 's go .
yeah , that 's right .
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective . they hang you for that , rico .
i 'm gon na save carmen .
what do you think you 're doing ?
hey , just calm down , i 'm giving the orders here-
we 're outa here . lieutenant , get your men into the skimmers . this real estate 's about to go buggy .
the rodger young just burned up ...
what 's your problem now , lieutenant ?
saddle up , boys , that 's our trash !
rodger young , prepare to receice outgoing fire ... ! i 'll take the first group .
you heard the sky marshall ... move it all down -
this is a fleet-driven operation , son , and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground . you can have everything else , eh ?
you 're standing on my h.q. , lieutenant !
this would be mine , sir . acting sergeant john rico . i 've assumed command on this mission .
on whose authority , corporal ?
not with an officer , no , sir . the m.i . does n't mint stupid cap troopers .
you heard me . wan na make something out of it , private ?
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?
i get it . this is the part that 's best for both of us . do n't do me anymore favors , eh ?
best in the fleet !
you can never be sure .
do n't get any ideas . she 's my girl .
then i hope you have a crazy pilot ! keep the line open , dizzy !
inside 4th brigade compound ? that 's crazy !
landing zone is extremely hostile . come down on this transmission !
what is your position ?
shut up , sir ! we need pick up now !
this is rodger young ... what 's going on down there ? we 're taking plasma ! we have orion p-11 as clear !
give'em hell , sir !
this is my farm . get on the boat , now ! that 's an order , sergeant .
we 're not leaving you here , sir !
rico , tell'em to glass this goddam planet . i 've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time ...
i ca n't my legs are gone ... get on the boat ...
hit your jets , sir !
cover us , ace !
aaaaaaaaaaaa !
yes , sir !
sergeant , secure the boat !
what 's going on , diz ?
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy , collect the big guns from the towers . watkins , put general owen with the wounded . rico , where 's my communications ?
looks like a bug was in his brain , sir .
what 's that look like to you , rico ?
yes , sir .
rico , you 're acting sergeant now . my last sergeant lost the com pack . put together a search team and find the radio shack . we need retrieval .
who 's that with you ?
yes , sir !
corporal , the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately . get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics .
never pass up a good thing , eh ?
yes , sir ...
yopu asked me some advice once , rico . want some now ?
yes , sir .
kill the bitch .
all dead except one , sir .
i 'm not interested in nostalgia , rico , i need a corporal . you 're it until you 're dead or i find someone better .
uni high tigers , sir . do n't you remember ? i was captain of the team .
where 'd you learn to do that , soldier ?
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has . use that freedom . make your own choice , rico .
well , my parents are against it , and i know it 's my choice , but i was wondering ... what would you do if you were me ?
good for you . go find out .
i wan na join up , mr. rasczak . i think i have what it take to be a citizen .
well , it 's not really my job to please . hope you learned something .
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year .
what is it , rico ?
mister rasczak ?
of course you do n't . i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue ' if it bit you in the ass .
uh , i do n't know .
the exact words of the text . but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue . a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic , of which he is a member , defending it , if need be , with his life . the civilian does not .
you . tell me the moral difference , if any , between the citizen and the civilian ?
we will answer and present < u > proof < /u > of our answer when it is ready !
< u > answer < /u > !
our data is being prepared .
v'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information .
then v'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices .
the information will not be disclosed .
they have repressed the creator .
because v'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet .
kirk-unit , < u > why < /u > do you not disclose information ?
kirk unit ! disclose the information !
not until v'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet .
disclose the information .
you infest and control enterprise . v'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the creator in the same manner .
the carbon-units are not responsible for that .
the creator has not answered .
< u > why < /u > ? !
the carbon-units infection will now be removed from the creator 's planet .
< u > why < /u > ... ? !
you may proceede .
the examination is a normal function .
v'ger is that which seeks the creator .
who is v'ger ?
the creator is that which created v'ger .
to join with him .
find the creator ? < u > what < /u > creator ? < u > whose < /u > ... ! ? what does v'ger want of the 'creator ' ... ?
v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator .
why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead ?
that unit no longer functions . i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon-based units infesting enterprise .
where is lt. ilia ?
is v'ger the captain of the alien vessel ?
v'ger is that which programmed me .
who is ... 'v'ger ' ... ?
it will ... take me from < u > you < /u > ...
and when v'ger melds ? what will happen to you ?
it expects a return signal now , ordering it to transmit that information to the creator .
'to learn all that is learnable . '
v'ger is announcing that it has arrived , sir -- that it 's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect ...
as i stated , v'ger calls to the creator .
to learn all that is learnable ; to deliver all collected data to the creator on the third planet . that is the programming .
to join , and become one with the creator ?
by the creator .
a machine ... ! then it had to be programmed . by < u > whom < /u > ... ?
that is how v'ger will survive .
you said v'ger 's purpose was to find and join with the creator .
the carbon units are of no consequence ; v'ger will determine their purpose .
does v'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units ?
that is logical . you may procede .
within you are memory patterns of a carbon unit . if i can help you revive these patterns ; you could understand our functions better .
when my examination is complete , the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns .
what does that mean ?
more data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage .
enterprise would be unable to function < u > without < /u > carbon units .
enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units .
what is enterprise 's proper evolvement ?
carbon units have clearly retarded enterprise 's proper evolvement .
yes .
carbon units are not true life forms ... do those images repre- sent how enterprise has evolved into its present form ?
the crews of the previous enterprises were also carbon units . in what way is the life form in your vessel different ?
mr. scott ... on my next signal .
tractor beam strength lessening , captain .
engineering ...
they reach final position in ... twenty-seven minutes -- mark .
mr. chekov , when do those devices activate ?
spock ... ! get a fix on his position !
sir ! airlock four has been opened ; a thruster suit is reported missing !
have a security team meet me at deck four main elevator !
deck four , captain ; officers ' quarters ... !
very well , mr. chekov , see to it . viewer off .
it is a courier , captain . grade one priority . non-belligerency confirmed .
departure angle .
departure angle on viewer .
enterprise , i want that signal again . transmit !
and plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this ... ... point here , captain . it should pick up even a tricorder playback .
capture god ! in order to retrieve v'ger 's data , the creator has to physically come here ! ...
the fault is here , sir , not in the transmission . the antenna leads have been disconnected . v'ger never intended to accept a transmitted signal .
captain ... i 'd like to go along ...
mr. decker ... i will contact you every five minutes . otherwise ... inform mr. scott immediately .
no !
captain , we ca n't be sure that our ... move ... will actually save earth .
, if we do not provide v'ger with certain information , we wo n't have twenty-two < u > seconds < /u > ; the plan must be implemented upon arrival .
i 'm afraid our hand is pretty weak , captain . but it 's the only game in town .
well , mr. decker , it seems my bluff is being called .
the question is , mr. decker , < u > is < /u > there a next move ...
captain , what 's the next move ?
they could have many ways of destroying things , mr. decker .
why bring us inside ? not to destroy us ; they could have done that outside .
forcefields , full remaining strength ... ! total reserve !
the ship is under attack ... ! man all defensive stations ... !
it 's running our records ! starfleet strength , earth defenses ...
it 's taken control of the computer ... !
< u > computer off < /u > !
you asked my opinion , sir .
how do you define < u > unwarranted < /u > , < u > mister < /u > ? !
that 's precisely the point , captain . we do n't know it will do . moving into the cloud -- at this time , is an unwarranted gamble .
that thing is twenty hours from earth . we know nothing about it yet .
i advise caution , captain ; we ca n't withstand another attack .
mr decker ... .
captain , we 've seen what their weapons can do . should n't we take every possible precaution -- ?
no ... ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile , mr. decker . cloud composition , mr. spock ?
recommend defensive posture , captain : screens and shields .
mister chekov , log mister spock 's starfleet commission reactivated ; list him as science officer ; both effective immediately .
of course not . i 'm aware of mister spock 's qualifications .
if our executive officer has no objections ... ?
yes , sir , i 'll do that .
i trust you will ... nursemaid me through these difficulties , mister ?
sir , you have n't logged a single star hour in two and a half years . that , plus your unfamiliarity with the ship 's design -- in my opinion , sir , seriously jeopardizes our mission .
granted .
permission to speak freely , sir ?
stop competing with me , decker !
i 'm aware of that , sir .
you saved the ship .
thank you , sir . i 'm sorry i embar- rassed you .
then you acted properly , of course .
sir , the enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines . when they went into anti-matter imbalance , the phasers were automatically cut off .
explanation , mr. decker : why was my phaser order countermanded ?
mister decker ; every minute brings that object nearer earth ! engineering ! stand by for warp drive .
... but i still recommend further simulation study .
program set for standard warp entry , captain ...
programming ready ?
you are , mister decker . i 'm afraid you 'll have to double as science officer .
none available , captain . there 's no one in fact , who 's fully rated on this design .
we 'll have to replace commander sonak . i 'd still like a vulcan there , if possible ...
no , admiral . i do n't think you are ; not one damned bit . i remember when you recommended me for this command . you told me how envious you were , and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again . well , sir , it looks like you found a way .
that 's why you 're staying aboard . i 'm sorry , will .
admiral , this is an almost totally new enterprise . you do n't know her a tenth as well as i do .
my experience -- five years out there dealing with unknowns like this -- my familiarity with the enterprise , this crew ...
may i ask why ?
yes .
-- you , personally , are assuming command ?
you 'll stay aboard as executive officer ... a temporary grade reduction to commander .
i 'm replacing you as captain of the enterprise .
you are what ... ?
i 'm taking over the center seat . i 'm sorry , will .
you got the enterprise , it 's what < u > you < /u > wanted . this is what i want . but , jim ... ... < u > i 'm < /u > the right choice for this mission .
jim ... he < u > wants < /u > it .
we have twenty-one minutes . captain , we can still save v'ger ... and ourselves .
that transmitter is a vital link between v'ger and the creator .
v'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe , thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions . to fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension ; v'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the creator .
mr. spock , what would v'ger need to fulfill itself ?
a tractor beam ...
forward motion , captain ... !
it seems we < u > all < /u > imagine god in our own image .
then v'ger believes the creator to be a < u > machine < /u > too .
that probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that < u > killed < /u > ilia !
exactly . and you did have a 'relationship ' with lieutenant ilia , commander .
we have just seen that its body duplicates our navigator in < u > precise < /u > detail . suppose that beneath its programming , the real ilia 's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision .
it 's a programmed < u > mechanism < /u > , mr. spock ...
captain ... this probe may be a key a key to the aliens .
this served the purpose .
we could have cut it off at the main computer ...
that would presuppose a feeling , commander ... compassion . i sensed < u > no < /u > emotion , only ... ... pure logic .
they may have attacked only as a warning to us , captain . to keep away .
no .
if i 'd seen you again , would you have been able to say it ?
that you left ? or that you did n't say 'goodbye ' ?
no more than i expected not as difficult as this . i 'm sorry ...
was he difficult ?
wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems ... !
navigational deflectors inoperative ... ! directional control also inoperative , captain ... !
unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us , captain ! directly ahead ... !
negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed .
i would never take advantage of a sexually immature species . you can assure him that 's true , ca n't you ?
i now the captain meant no person- al insult .
decker ... . !
hello , ilia .
viewer , standard ahead .
fifteen seconds to cloud boundary .
opinion , mister . spock ?
thirty seconds to cloud boundary ...
ten seconds ... .
transmit , mr. spock ! now !
impact in fifteen seconds ...
mr. spock ?
i stand corrected mr. decker . navigator , lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center ; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there ...
five minutes to cloud boundary !
mr. chekov , stand by on the phasers ... !
twelve seconds ... !
time to impact ... ?
my oath of celibacy is on record captain . may i assume my duties ?
and in you , too , lieutenant .
our exec and science officer ...
'commander ' decker ?
welcome aboard , lieutenant .
lieutenant ilia reporting for duty , sir .
that was the order , mr. sulu : clear the bridge .
clear the bridge , captain ... ?
thrusters at station keeping ...
hold station ... !
thrusters ahead , one third .
maneuvering thrusters , mr. sulu ; ahead one third . full sensor scan , mr. spock ; they ca n't expect us < u > not < /u > to look them over now !
viewer ahead , sir .
viewer ahead .
hold relative position here ...
one hundred kilometers ...
adjust parallel course , navigator . bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance .
we 're already two settings below that , sir .
reduce magnification . factor 4 , mr. sulu .
aye , sir .
mr. sulu , steady as she goes .
accelerating to warp one , sir .
ahead warp one , mr sulu .
thrusters at station-keeping , sir .
hold station .
maneuvering thrusters , sir .
maneuvering thrusters , mister sulu .
he 's in engineering , sir ... he does n't know .
i appreciate the welcome ; i wish the circumstances were less critical . epsilon nine is monitoring the intruder ; keep a channel open to them . where is captain decker ?
starfleet , boost your matter gain ; we need more signal !
we 're losing the pattern ... !
two and a half years as chief of starfleet operations may have made me a little stale , mr. scott -- but i would n't exactly consider myself 'untried . '
the crew has n't had near enough transition time with all the new equipment . and the engines , admiral : they 've yet to be even tested at warp power . add to that , an untried captain ...
mr. scott , there 's an alien object with unbelievable destructive power less than three days away from this planet ...
admiral , the enterprise has just finished eighteen months redesign- ing and refitting . she needs testing , a shakedown ...
see that it is . take me over , please .
we 're hoping it 's only a temporary problem , admiral ...
why are n't the enterprise transporters in operation , mister scott ?
admiral , i 've been hoping to see you . maybe you can get through to those thick heads in starfleet that ...
i prefer your poet dante 's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit . '
... and the 'foolish ' emotions which drive us ?
yes , captain . it needed our mortality , the fear of it , our struggle against it , our fears , our dreams ...
spock , we < u > were < /u > its answer !
that seems to be what it has planned -- to have the creator physically present here .
there 's no way to know . v'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity . all of us here may be reduced into patterns ...
... and then to reassemble itself < u > combined < /u > with the creator . the most certain way of obtaining all the creator 's answers .
v'ger plans to literally < u > meld < /u > to reduce both itself and the creator to patterns ...
the point is , captain , < u > twenty-two < /u >
the point ...
captain , the orbital device will not be triggered for twenty-two minutes ...
there is no alternative .
has not , doctor -- and now , because of what we are planning ... will not ...
no , captain , not for us ... for v'ger .
not for us ?
precisely .
the orbiting devices would be controlled from the point , then ... ?
yes , captain , a child : evolving into adulthood -- learning , searching -- instinctively needing .
child ... ! ?
high mag , mr. sulu !
these read as identical composition ... ... however , captain , they measure several hundred times more powerful !
'is this all i am ? is there not more ? '
what answers ?
no meaning ... no hope ... and , jim , no answers ... ! jim , it 's looking for < u > answers < /u > < u > itself < /u > !
what should you have known ?
a life form of its own ; a conscious , living entity .
were you right ? spock ? v'ger is a living machine ... ?
captain , i do not believe there < u > is < /u > a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such .
if this is their ship 's data banks , where is the crew ? or is their entire ship automated ?
exact patterns . the energy bolt that hit them was n't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them , stored them . but why ?
klingons ... our epsilon 9 station ... and ilia ! ! they seem to be more than just images ...
new crystals : they must contain the most recent data obtained --
and these 'sensor-swarms ' collect that data , carry it here .
it would appear that the atomic arrays of these crystals store information . a remarkably efficient system .
answers to what , spock ? our dilemma -- or your < u > personal < /u > one ?
i am seeking answers , captain .
bridge , cancel rescue teams . spock , what in the hell are you doing out here !
i am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information .
spock ? concerned about his chances ?
ilia 's memory , her feelings of loyalty , friendship , obedience ... might all be there .
... they may have followed it < u > too < /u > precisely .
they had a pattern to follow ...
i believe the light flares to be energy fields -- undoubtedly part of the vessel 's inner mechanism . a technology so incredibly sophisticated that i can not --
have you been able to analyze < u > any < /u > of this ... ?
delay that order , scotty ... ! disengage all main drive systems !
we can not break free , captain . we do not have a fraction of the power necessary .
get someone up here to take the navigator 's station ... ! engineering ... full emergency power !
captain , we have been seized by a tractor beam ... !
transmit image of the alien to starfleet ; advise we are attempting further communication .
that vessel is generating a forcefield measurably greater than the radiation of the earth 's sun .
instruments fluctuating , captain . patterns unrecognizable .
no vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude ...
mr. decker ... ?
recommend we proceede , captain .
but they understood our messages ; they broke off the attack .
we are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality ... yet they can not understand who we are , or what we want .
our ... 'insignificance ' ?
the 'puzzlement ' i sensed was fleeting ... minor ... ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance , captain .
any reply from them ?
it appears that our message has been understood , captain .
communicated with us < u > how < /u > ?
they have ... they < u > have < /u > been communicating with us . i sense ... < u > puzzlement < /u > . why have we not replied ?
mr. decker , i will not provoke an attack , if that order is n't clear to you ...
captain , i suspect there 's an object at the heart of that cloud .
intruder scans emanate from the exact cloud center . energy of a type entirely un- known to me .
do < u > not < /u > return scan , mr. spock ! it may be misinterpreted as hostility !
i know this has been painful , spock . for me too . thank you .
i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer ... sir .
let it drop , bones . you are my science officer -- i 'll expect an < u > immediate < /u > report on anything further you learn or < u > sense < /u > from here on .
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not .
and whatever you sensed out here ... .
i still contain fragments of my human half .
that inquiry invades my personal life , captain .
also -- there was nothing in your report about < u > why < /u > you 're here .
negative , captain . i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic . i can explain nothing more ; i understand nothing more .
you 've reported that you felt strong thought emotions . a group of minds from a space vessel ? could you make out any plan , anything to do with earth ?
i want him here . sit down !
sir , i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview .
sit down , please .
reporting as ordered , captain .
i intend to be there following that meeting . report to me . one hour !
to you , sir ?
twelve ! i 'm on my way to a meeting with admiral nogura which will not last more than three minutes . report to me on the enterprise in one hour .
which will require twenty more hours at minimum , admiral ...
here at starfleet ... ? the enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock ...
captain decker requested i complete final science briefing here before ...
why are n't you on board ?
based , i am told , on your recommendation , admiral . thank you .
you 've received your appointment as enterprise science officer ?
thank you , scotty . stand by .
we 're ready , sir .
engineering ... status , mr. scott ?
aye , we understand that sir ! we 're doing our best .
that object out there is less than two days from earth , mister scott . we 've got to intercept while it still is out there !
captain , it was our anti-matter imbalance that created the wormhole in the first place . it will happen again if we do n't correct it .
warp drive as soon as possible , mr. scott .
engineer , we need warp speed now !
captain , we need further warp simulation on the flow sensors ...
tractor beam remains constant ...
starfleet has been apprised of our situation , captain .
< u > urgent < /u > signal from starfleet , captain ! < u > all < /u > earth defense systems have gone dead .
the third one is moving off too -- a fourth one is forming ...
confirm , captain . lunar beacons indicate intruder on a course into earth orbit ...
starfleet signals , sir , growing in strength ... they -- have intruder on their monitors -- it 's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate ...
subspace frequencies are jammed by wormhole effect !
negative helm control , captain ! going reverse on impulse power ... !
helm ready , sir .
dock control reports ready , sir .
dock signals clear , captain .
transporters room and chief engineer scott report trans- porter system fully repaired and now functioning normally , sir .
you bet your life .
go you huskies ?
he 'll eat potroast and like it .
he have any special dietary requirements ... ?
sure plan to .
you bringing your new friend ?
i 'll be there .
mom 's expecting you for dinner tonight .
i 'm goin off-shift . come on ... i 'll walk you home .
then you 'll be wet .
i 'll walk you home , you can have my coat .
nope .
annie ... got an umbrella ... ?
cal ...
evening , cal . would you tell me about it ?
evening , annie .
i 'll knit you a sweater .
if i go to jail ... ?
i 'll wait for you ... i 'm proud of you . i 'll < u > be < /u > waiting .
i 'm going to tell the truth .
what are you going to do ?
... you think that 's right ...
i ... i < u > think < /u > that 's right ...
carla was in the car , right ?
they 'll ... they 'll < u > blackball < /u > me ...
maybe they 'll be < u > other < /u > movies .
but it 'll stop the movie .
but that 's what happened .
i ca n't do that . if i tell them , they 'll , if i < u > tell < /u > them , they 'll try bob for rape , they 'll ... it 'll ruin his career ...
you got to tell em that you saw the accident . do n't you ?
what am i gon na do ?
i saw ...
what is it all about ?
that 's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers . both up with the chickens .
lookit that , up already .
well ai n't you amazing .
happen to know where there 's one for sale .
well , i could < u > get < /u > a rolltop desk .
not without a rolltop desk .
to print the newspaper . and i 'd come to < u > write < /u > . to write . to write . right here in the office .
... the better to eat me with , your dear ?
and come to the printshop . you know < u > why < /u > ... ?
... well , we do that < u > anyway < /u > ...
... and we could get up every morning ...
now you 're talking ...
we could live up here , live up in the country .
yes ...
i 've been thinking : look at this : we live up here ...
oh yeah .
yeah , you ?
sleep well ?
good morning .
people might be better off . they thought about it , spent the evening back in the ...
pelting down out there .
what ?
you know what else a man can do ?
that 's something a man could do ... ?
you 'd do the newspaper right here .
best way i know to get ink on your hands .
did as of last week .
it does ?
press still works .
start back up the waterford sentinel . town newspaper . show you the plans ...
what would you do with it , the printshop ...
... what ... ?
gosh , you look nice .
how 's your star ?
i 'd love to .
would you like to < u > see < /u > it ? i 've got the key back at my store ...
yep . n'it 's for sale . one of the few things money can buy .
is it ...
yessuh . joseph knights printshop . vacant for thirty years .
no . you , i told them , you ca n't betray with the picture what you 're saying with the words . and , i do n't know , the movies , i do n't know . they should be socially uplifting , why does she have to show her br ... what is this ... ?
no , that 's true .
... how < u > else < /u > can you talk ?
i did n't say anything special , i was just talking out loud .
i told them what you said about the script ...
what ?
going home , yeah . i told them what you said ...
going home .
where you going ?
hi .
hi .
... take < u > any < /u > two people ...
that 's right ...
that 's ... that 's < u > exactly < /u > what it 's about . take ...
because it 's about < u > purity < /u > ...
has been wounded by < u > her < /u > heat ... by her < u > infidelities < /u > ...
... yes .
... her unbridled sexuality . that he ...
... yes .
she < u > realizes < /u > -- it was not the fire which < u > hurt < /u > him ... that the < u > true < /u > hurt was her . was her ...
... he stuck a fishhook in it .
i hurt you ?
ah . ah . ah ...
how about , he sees her on the street , he wipes the soot from his eyes . he goes up to her . `` what happened to the horse ? '' she looks at him . she takes his hand ...
< u > please < /u > ...
what about ... what about ... it 's so presumptuous of me , to be , to be telling < u > you < /u > how to wr ...
they meet on main street . her horse has just died . he 's coming from the fire .
what 've you got ?
it used to be the old mill .
what 's the scene ...
i ca n't get it to come out right .
good morning to < u > you < /u > ... whatsa matter ?
go you huskies !
yes .
time for a change . keep your margins straight .
why ?
sure did .
you used to go out with him , you broke up with him ?
i used to go out with a politician .
do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd ?
so is our electoral process . but we still vote .
but it 's absurd .
i do if you do .
you believe that ?
oh < u > okay < /u > .
because i 'd met someone else .
you can do it .
no , i just broke up with him . i 'll see you tomorrow .
you , um , you , um , you going out with your fiance ?
then i 'll come back , then .
later on .
oh . that 's alright . then i 'll come back at a better time . what would be a better time ?
start ? this is n't a good time .
... because if you do n't , they die ...
why ?
do n't you think you should put them in water ?
oh .
the other side .
`` to the love of my life , love , doug '' ?
read the card .
thank you .
you going to ask me in ?
hi .
one moment .
it 's for your finger .
i do n't drink .
and here 's some hydrogen peroxide .
oh , god ...
i 'm gon na be your typist for this evening .
you have to sign for it .
would you put on your cl ... just leave it outside .
would you go in ...
`` room service ! ''
great . who is it ... ?
better'n new , cause it 's got a < u > story < /u > . want to do the other part ?
gon na ' be good as new .
better idea ...
fix my glasses .
paperclip ?
me , too . you have a paperclip ?
never saw the point of 'em .
you like kids ?
you got a paperclip ?
... lost the screw ...
my glasses fell apart . i lost the ...
what are you doing down there ?
what ?
`` rise , one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice . ''
they 're all preparing for the auditions - your movie .
uh huh .
cast stood me up .
what happened ?
that 's for sure .
well , then , it do n't look good for the huskies ...
do n't look good for `` trial of the heart . ''
i thought you had play practice .
hello .
... oh ... oh . well . that 's very important .
tonight , tonight , i ... i have play practice ...
yes .
me ?
what are you < u > doing < /u > tonight ?
this is , look : go you huskies . ... what < u > i < /u > see you saying , is : you have the two elements , fire and < u > water < /u > . the firehouse , and the < u > old mill < /u > ... do you know , you could ...
he does n't go back to the < u > mill < /u > , he gets a second chance to go back to the < u > firehouse < /u > ...
no , i do n't ...
wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance , do you see ? and < u > you < /u > get a second chance !
< u > how < /u > ... ?
but but but but but it 's better < u > without < /u > ...
i ...
the < u > firehouse < /u > ...
... the , the , the symbol of the fire ...
that 's why you did n't want to take the < u > mill < /u > out ... you 've ...
about < u > conflict < /u > ...
< u > yes < /u > ...
what i need to < u > say < /u > ...
well , first , you got to change the title ...
but how do i ... how do i do a film called `` the old mill , '' when i do n't have an old mill ?
you bet your life . `` the mill wheel goes around ... some times it 's even under water -- then it rises up , as high as it can go ... ''
i < u > can < /u > ?
it 's in your script ... it 's about getting a second chance . innit ? `` you < u > can < /u > go back ... ''
how can you < u > say < /u > that ?
you 'd know better'n me .
in fact , in fact , in fact , i 'm not sure if i 'm giving < u > them < /u > a second chance , or they 're giving it to me . that 's the truth . the truth 's best , do n't you think ?
i love your script .
i ... i decided to give it another chhh ...
you 're still here .
they decided , i decided to , to ... you love what ?
what are you doing ? i love your script .
hi .
mister white is ...
well , i guess i 'll ... get down to the station . it was lovely meeting ...
... who ... ?
... that .
yes ...
cause , cause , it 's ... it 's the < u > simple < /u > things , that ...
mmm .
... such a pleasant sound .
... i always thought so ...
... that 's what the swing is < u > there < /u > for ... thats its < u > purpose < /u > , < u > is n't < /u > it ...
that 's what the swing is < u > there < /u > for ...
i do n't mean to impose , but ... do you think we might ...
surest thing you know .
really . with the porch swing and everything ...
i live there .
for example , he 's just come back from a < u > fire < /u > and he ... um ... that 's a fine house . you look at that , and you know , there 's nice people that live there .
everyday things ... yes .
the , the , the , the < u > sanctity < /u > of everyday things ...
that whole ...
no , no . of course , that 's < u > exactly < /u > what it represents ...
so that the old mill , the old < u > mill < /u > represents ... the wheel of fate is that too ...
goodbye .
goodbye .
and likewise .
well . it was a pleasure meeting you .
and you 're the only one who 'll ever hear that speech . just you .
that 's that 's that 's that 's beautiful ...
... that it has been vouchsafed to him .
of course .
of course , of course that 's what i 'm < u > saying < /u > . as the old mill goes around , he < u > sees < /u > ...
as the old mill goes around ...
... that ... he < u > sees < /u > that ...
i understand ...
of < u > mercy < /u > ... off ...
yes ...
that : in an act of ...
no , no , i see ...
but , but but but ...
yes ...
that , he says , there < u > are < /u > no second chances ... that he 's been presented what he < u > prayed < /u > for ... and : he 's ruined it .
yes .
... that ... that he < u > prayed < /u > for a second chance . but ... do you see ?
central high , 'n ' matinees , the bijou theatre .
that 's true . you grow up here ?
you get what you pay for .
it was either that , or a sardine .
but why the dalmation ?
first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year 642 .
ever wonder why the dalmation 's the symbol of the firehouse ?
it 's ...
no , of course , you want to get out of town .
i ...
it 's about a man who gets a second chance .
no , of course , you do n't want to talk about it .
n'about ten minutes . what was your movie about ?
could you tell me when 's the next train ?
it 's about life .
why ?
yes .
you like my play .
it 's in your play .
that 's good . that 's really good . you have a gift for words .
well . everybody has reversals . if you were never down how would you know when you were up ?
i just got kicked off my first movie .
do n't be so hard on yourself .
actually , i 'm not sure if i quit . i think that i got fired . i 'm such a liar . i never could tell the truth .
why did you quit ?
i quit the movie .
you quit .
i quit .
i beg your pardon ?
so young , so unlined , so full of promise . so innocent .
`` anguish . ''
what 's it called ?
you have n't heard of it .
you wrote a play on it , what play is that ?
other one has history , too . i wrote my play on it .
you buy the typewriter , i 'll get it all spruced up , good as new . better than new . it has some history .
well , it had sentimental value .
that 's why they have state borders ... why n't you get a replacement ?
the people in new hampshire .
who ?
i have one , but they lost it .
why do n't you buy it , only forty bucks .
i want to rent this one .
we got em . north ... no , henry james was the novelist , frank james was a criminal ... yep , you came to the right place . jessie james was the < u > brother < /u > . of the novelist , that 's right . that 's alright susie . see you tomorrow , susie .
i need a typewritter .
northern books . what can i do for you ?
everybody makes their own fun . f'you do n't make it yourself , it ai n't fun , it 's entertainment .
... small town . i suppose . you have to make your own fun .
local drama group . northern books . no , it has n't come in yet . as soon as it does . yup , you too marge .
you 're doing a < u > play < /u > ...
why , you < u > whore < /u > !
i 'm sorry .
no . do n't tell me that .
he works on the movie .
who is this person that you 've found ?
i 'm sorry .
let me review here : you 're ... what are you ... you 've ... it 's all over between us ?

this is a joke , right ?
he 's not even there . you do n't see him , you do n't hear him , you 're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys .
you have to ignore him .
i call him a fartface or a pervert , or something equally lame .
and what do you do wh ...
good girl .
not with my mouth open .
you would n't kiss him , huh ?
... they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen ' or the 'ice princess ' , or some < u > really < /u > clever cut like that . like it hurts my feelings .
you do n't like his friends .
every time i 'm on the lunch yard , and he 's with twelve of his retarded < u > dorkface < /u > little adoring out-crowd < u > henchmen < /u > ...
actually . i could only help him .
great .
i could help with the debate .
a debate . man 's inhumanity to woman . he 's pro women . i 'm con . ms. flannery is twisted .

secret 's safe with me .
and do n't tell her i told you .
i bet .
actually . she 's kind of cool , when you get to know her .
she knows every neat junk food place .
like a big sister .
... i mean , she knows all the music , and pop stars , and clothes and stuff . she 's like still a kid , herself .
are you < u > kidding < /u > ? it is < u > so < /u > much better than the one rachel showed me !
i hope it 's the right kind .
well . it 's for you .
wow . who 's that for ?
i 'll be there for you .
that happens . to families .
like seeing the good side of rachel . so she 'll see the good side of us .
like how ?
but we do have a choice . to make it better . instead of worse .
daddy and i tried hard . we really did .
no i 'm not . i do n't care . why should i care ? i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced . nobody asked me if i wanted a new mother . nobody even asked me if i like her . if you guys do n't care about our family staying together , why sh ...
look she 's upset --
or blush . you look pale .
well daddy and i are just friends now , and that 's no reason not to wear mascara ...
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates ...
i 'm a little tired and it 's just a pick-me-up .
then why are you putting on mascara ?
probably you -- your brother -- school -- the solar system ... the usual ...
what are you gon na talk about ?
because it 's quiet . and he wants to talk . alise -- once he saws you in half , it 's bedtime ...
i like talking about it . at least , to you .
so why are you asking me ?
because it feels really incredibly good .
... why do you think ?
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh ...
i live . in the same country .
how would you know sh ...
during sex .
scream .
why does rachel scream ?
well , not exactly s ...
sex . of course .
daddy was washing rachel . in the shower . what did you think that was about ?
i 'll ride ahead . nelson , protect the queen ...
lord nelson , napoleon 's troops . i fear for the women and the property values .
annabelle , daddy and i will always be there . that 's one time always is always . you can call him after dinner but ...
i 'm gon na call him .
never say never you always say that . i 'll bet daddy 's mad at me now .
that will never happen .
what happens when he loves rachel more than us ?
it happens .
it just slipped out .
well , he 's not president anymore , so why be petty .
like who ?
look if the truth is you do n't feel like talking about this right now that 's fine . but do n't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me . cause there are only so many lies you 're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face . you wind up looking like ...
i 'm not upset . why would i be upset ?
maybe you 're upset that rachel moved in .
mass hysteria .
well you 're telling your teachers and your friends --
i do n't want that to happen . why would i want that to happen ?
well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen .
i did n't say that . why would i say that ?
excellent point .
i hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up .
thank you . those were all words . i hate the planet uranus . < u > terrible < /u > name for a planet .
i hate when you say that .
< u > never < /u > say 'never ' -- it 's < u > not < /u > fair to say 'always ' -- and < u > no < /u > name calling . use your words .
i know you do n't , but if you had , chrom- atically you < u > are < /u > in the purple family .
i do n't care .
... it 's really not so bad annabelle -- red and blue make purple .
a < u > suitable < /u > boy , will be at < u > this < /u > flagpole , < u > on < /u > monday , with a < u > very < /u > expensive bike , and he will be a stone fox if i have to call an < u > escort < /u > service !
but rache ...
the guy < u > i < /u > see is in the eighth grade at < u > prep < /u > school , and he laughs his < u > ass < /u > off every time we talk about you .
he 'll be impressed . the clincher is , you < u > walk < /u > away , then < u > whip < /u > around ...
in high school .
oh . it 's an incredibly disgusting , and not remotely sexy thing , that they described in a movie i 'd never let you go to . but it 's real . does he have an older brother ?
uh . what is it ?
no . but they stand out , a little . like this .
great . big ears , too ?
uh . he thinks his nose is too big . but it 's not .
help me here ...
no , baby . you 're gon na use < u > my < /u > words .
not use my words , please !
and you < u > do n't < /u > tell her . what you 're going to say .
that 's because your mother is a fine person , finer than i will ever be . now , just this once ...
and mom says anger never , never < u > solves < /u > anything . it makes every- thing < u > worse < /u > .
no , < u > his < /u > mother 's always on time .
now is that little prick still here , because if he is , i 'm gon na rip his fucking < u > heart < /u > out !
... laughed , yeh . they laughed real hard .
i < u > did < /u > what she said . i < u > used < /u > my words , i < u > told < /u > him what i < u > felt < /u > , and they ...
it 's not your < u > fault < /u > ! !
oh , baby , i 'm so sor ...

& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ;

& quot ; goodnight moon , goodnight hush , goodnight mush , goodnight goodnight goodnight gracie -- goodnight ben !
mmmm ! tasty . you 're a master chef ben . just like your dad .

& quot ; in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon ... & quot ;
thank you ben . that was so sweet of you . goodnight annabelle . sweet dreams .
i made you some cocoa . see ?
annabelle let 's get something clear .
excuse me --

hello ? ... duncan ... the ad agency 's already there ? ... i 'm out the door ... ben ! knock it off ! it 's gon na go beautifully ... damn it ben --
but you told us to starve .
alright starve .

then have a donut --
you touched it .
fine .
no ! cocoa puffs on top -- fruit loops on the bottom .
fine ! eat in the cupboard .
no .
oh my god . that is so not funny . you 're late . you 're really late . now get out here and have some cereal .
no , it is n't . because it is n't everything . and we want every- thing , do n't we ?
it 's not good enough .
always . always . and you wo n't hear a voice . but in < u > here < /u > . you 'll know . what i 'm saying .
can i talk to you ? when you 're there .
right here . right here . < u > inside < /u > the magician . shhhh .
so where are you ?
the world . < u > thinks < /u > i 'm gone . but only the magician . knows better .
half . of him .
but you can still see him .
if a soldier loses his legs in a war . is he the same guy ? sure he is .
you dying .
so what do you think we 're gon na talk about ?
well , do n't make him disappear before i see him .
rache says it 's from you .
find the bird cage ?
rache can do that part .
i 've got a lot of medicine in me , sweetie . and i 'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar ...
i helped .
okay . these are good .
oh .
ask her , she 's a heroic fireperson . she does this twenty times a day .
how do you know ?
ben . god does n't like visitors .
heaven . i have to tell him he 's made a mistake . he should take grammy martha first . or grandpa norman .
ben where do you have to get to ?
before you .
where ben ?
no ! i have to get there .
ben ! mommy 's so glad to see you -- now stop climbing ! ben listen to me ...
sugar . i was slow dancing to that song before rachel was even born .
that 's rache 's song !
in the still ... still of the ni-ight ... i held you ... held you so ti-ight ...
i 'm still sick , but i 'm better .
so you 're okay .
is your bad ?
grammy had a different kind . there are lots of kinds . hers was very bad .
i have cancer . do you know what that is ?
you have the worst flu since ...
mommy 's sick , guys .
pray . we never find out .
no .
nope . i got my warm t-shirt .
are you crazy , you could < u > suffocate < /u > in there ! ! !
thursday 's fine ...
mommy , if your real name 's jackie and i call you mommy ; and rachel 's real name 's rachel ... then when i see her do i say hi stepmommy ? and if my name 's ben , how come you do n't call me son ?
tomorrow ? can i have one butterscotch pudding for dessert ?
i 'm fine , ba ...
mom ... ?
that i do . always will .
do me a favor ? eat it , and then give me a secret report , okay ? pay particular attention to whether it 's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup .
i did . do i have to eat lamb ? daddy did n't cook it , she did .
of course , you do . being magic . then you know i 've got a flu bug , and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food . so , all the more meatballs for you . but you know what .
yes .
i 'm somewhere , thinking of you . and meatballs . and you know what ?
where are you , anyway ?
not a lot , sweetie . it 's a country . like canada . only smaller .
is that like luigi 's ?
you 'll be up to your armpits in meatballs , i 'm flying them in from sweden .
and many meatballs .
honey , this is thursday . i pick you up tomorrow , and we do < u > big < /u > spaghetti .
rache says i have to eat < u > lamb < /u > . i told her < u > you 're < /u > making me < u > spaghetti < /u > !
if you want me to hate her i will .
what honey ?
mommy ?
yes ... if you like big hair ...
i think she 's pretty , mommy .
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money .
does rachel make a lot of money ?
ben , mommies work too . they work very hard . mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working . i just do n't get paid .
rachel 's job is she works .
no , that 's your fault . it 's her fault for not watching over my precious son , as if it were her priority . which means , the most important job .
mommy ? it 's not rachel 's fault i ran away .
i knew where i was all the time .
ben ! oh my ben ! are you alright ?
thank you ben . annabelle !
poof ! you 're happy now .
seven of clubs . nobody 's mad we just want to talk about it .
queen of diamonds .
lava 's hateable . i never thought of that .
i have lava .
i hate snails and blue cheese . especially together . < u > hate < /u > .
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel 's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches ?
why does rachel wear daddy 's underpants ? does n't she have underpants of her own ?
sure . i was just doin ' my nails .
may i remind you that duncan has the < u > client < /u > arriving at exac ...
actually , never . they 'll always hate you . there 's a gene for it .
and when did that pass ?
i once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother 's head --
you say that like i do n't know that .
you 've got a fruit loop in your hair .
cooper , back the fill off i do n't have enough shadow ...
sooner than later . you really need to .
why would his worry ? or my children 's worry . or anyone 's worry . help the sit ...
have you still never told him ?
i have to get dressed . my ex-husband has asked me to dinner . god knows why , he was very mysteri ...
let 's take our best shot .
that 's necessary , huh ?
at first . then , after awhile , some chemo .
so we 'll ... radiate some more ?
every day . more and more .
people beat it , do n't they ? all the time .
rachel , < u > do n't < /u > do this , you will < u > never < /u > forgive yourself !
no , no , no , this is a job that 's hard to < u > keep < /u > , < u > not < /u > a job that 's hard to < u > lose < /u > , ca n't be both .
you ca n't < u > do < /u > that , i wo n't < u > let < /u > you !
duncan . i 've got an < u > even < /u > < u > better < /u > idea ...
you 're making a < u > career < /u > decision here , i would < u > strongly < /u > sugg ...
they 're losing one mother . they ca n't lose two .
look , i will < u > send < /u > a p.a . to pick up the children . there are < u > agencies < /u > that supply sitters , nannies ...
which part of no do n't you understand ?
we do n't know if you 've got it , we have n't seen it yet ! now go back and finish !
i 've got it . it 's in the can , cooper can wrap th ...
but you 're not < u > done < /u > !
it 's 1:45 , i told you there 's no one to pick up annab ...
duncan . my work is everything to me . this 'll never happen again . now stand back -- this session 's gon na make you remember why you hired me even though i would n't sleep with you -- cooper let 's get these penguins dancing --
congratulations . only forty minutes late . you 're handling this promotion really well rachel .
a lot smaller .
i had a lot of treatments , and they were n't any fun , but the tests show the cancer got smaller .
i live or i die .
what happens next ?
walk in the park . and thanks for the 'we ' .
we 're going to win this .
i know . i would n't know what to say . if it were you .
yeh , better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and ... couscous , was it she made him ? boy , kids go wild for that .
yet another spaghetti night .
never stand between that kid and a meatball .
you want us to take him tonight ? give you some private time with annab ... .
it 's good . you 're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us , are you ?
it 's temporary .
stop . you 're making me insecure .
she 's a charmer , you 'll see . in fifty years , the kids 'll love her ten percent as much as they love you .
and we all went through that together ?
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced ?
the great thing about life is that things keep changing .
no . you think this is going to help the kids then you do it . you 're on your own .
you 're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us . we should tell them together .
we 're still their parents for the next hundred years .
we are over .
we ...
you ca n't be an 'us ' just when you want to . you ca n't play that card when it 's convenient .
it 's a huge moment in their life --
to make it easier for them or you ?
it 's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them ... i 'd like you to be there .
just not to me .
i grew up , a little . i 'm ready for a life that 's built around commitm ...
tell me exactly how you 're different from three years ago ? the music sounds kind of the same from where i 'm sitting .
i did n't think a phone call was appropriate ...
getting so beautiful ... she looks more like you every day . jackie ... i 've really given this a lot of thought . a great deal of thought ...
annabelle showed me the new dress . she 's amazing in it .
still , please .
and i 'm supposed to care .
i 'm afraid she 's going to walk .
< u > slugs < /u > . have faster learning curves . < u > trees < /u > , even .
you know the kids are n't really in danger . this is about rachel , and you 're right , i 'm disappointed in her learning curve , and ...
partly . but partly , you 're mad .
you 're saying , do n't make the kids a football , do n't put them through a war . but i 'm doing this for < u > their < /u > well-being .
do n't do this .
called him . we set an ap ...
we 've broken a lot of promises , have n't we luke ?
jackie stop . we promised we never go there .
i 'm not gon na wait around to see the next one . i 'm not gon na watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement . i 'm seeing a lawyer .
jackie , you 've made mistakes -- we all make mistakes --
not to me .
but he has n't . he wandered off . i know it 's terrifying . i can imagine how you felt when that call came -- but it happens .
do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today ? how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did ? he could have been ...
our children .
... until the plan changed , when jessie 's mom gave us these tickets . what , rachel . 'forgot ' i told her ?
jackie , < u > we < /u > were taking them water- skiing for the < u > whole < /u > weekend !
at the big apple circus , it 's the only big top i know . i < u > said < /u > i 'd get 'em back tonight ...
you 're where ?
just outside the big top , we 're almo ...
good ... well ... take care .
easy enough .
fine . but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so i 'll take wednesday , and you can pick up that thursday , friday after soccer , and saturday before riding .
luke , i need to switch next friday for thursday , so why do n't you take the weekend ... ... that way you 'll be there , and i 'll pick up monday , tuesday , and wednesday .
me too .
i 'm worried .
you ask me that counselor 's making a mountain out of a molehill ...
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes ...
i 'll call from work . we can have a conference call .
it 's wednesday night . she 's at my house . i 'll talk to her .
thank you mrs. franklin . jackie ? this has been very valuable for us . and i 'll have a serious talk with annabelle tonight .
jackie , she was five minutes late --
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up --
napalm .
jackie , they come to be part of my life . rachel < u > is < /u > part of that life .
they want to be with you luke , they go to your house to be with their father .
well , we 're not discussing rachel 's age either .
we 're not discussing your age .
rachel 's not half my age .
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids , he 's now living with a woman half his age --
i 've been with someone for quite some time , and did n't feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly . but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month .
you think i did n't get that ?
something 's up wi ...
i 'm here . i 've got a case where they 're this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing ? !
because you do n't really seem here .
i 'm here .
are you here ?
remarried . there is no move .
planning on getting --
just sit me up . nice and tall . bring benjamin first .
you know , there 's nothing you have to say . because they know your heart . you do n't have t ...
just want to be a little sharper . for a few minutes .
now edna says you short-changed your last meds . you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time , y'know .
i have their past .
you know every story , every wound , every memory , their whole life 's < u > happiness < /u > has been wrapped up in < u > you < /u > , every moment ...
you 'll learn .
you ride with annabelle ...
you 're the hip and fresh .
everything . you 're ... the earth mother incarnate ...
what do i have that you do n't ?
with good reason . they fucking worship you as it is .
uh . you hate my guts ?
why did n't i ?
he only remembers i < u > found < /u > him . my point is , telling you this story would have been the kindest , most helpful thing i could ever have done for you .
ben never mentioned it .
i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off . doing my imitation of you .
you are lying , you never lost that kid for 4 < u > seconds < /u > , you could find him from a < u > coma < /u > , there is no way !
i lost him . i was panicked .
you 're lying .
maybe i was wrong on that one .
come on , a wuss like me ? the stiff who would n't help her own daughter fight back ?
well , it 's the jack kennedy syndrome , huh ? you die young , you always look golden . perfect . the memory kind of burnishes the image , and ...
is scary . but you want it . gim me some truth here .
i never wanted to be a mom . then , sharing it with you was one thing . carrying it alone , the rest of my life ...
and i have looked down the road . at what my life will be . and i ca n't handle it .
no , there is n't .
i love luke , i love the children . but there is more to life than even love ...
do n't flatter yourself . i always liked that line .
what 's this about ? because we < u > fought < /u > ?
double .
she likes a stolie , no ice .
neutral ground . what 's up ?
thanks for coming out .
< u > that 's < /u > what it is . and that 's < u > all < /u > it is .
you 've turned her into you . and i may not get another chance . to turn her back .
and she 'll fight back again . god help me , what have i done .
and there will come < u > another < /u > moment . when the stakes are < u > really < /u > there . and she will look back on this . and remember how good it felt . how easy it was .
well , that 's what parenting is < u > about < /u > , little girl . they are < u > pleading < /u > to know how they are supposed to do it . and you sure as hell < u > showed < /u > her .
she was n't steering her own course , she was steering < u > yours < /u > .
doing the < u > right < /u > thing . knowing who you < u > are < /u > , inside . not < u > caving < /u > to peer pressure , or < u > lowering < /u > yourself to that level , < u > steering < /u > your < u > own < /u > course ...
shut the fuck up . < u > i < /u > did n't go behind < u > your < /u > back .
oh please .
see , in that crisis , i saw an opportunity . for some < u > real < /u > growth .
well , maybe < u > your < /u > version of growing up is 'just win , baby ' .
you were n't passing 'em out .
you think < u > i < /u > did n't have some dirty words for that little putz ? you think < u > i < /u > could n't figure out some low blows ?
that 's not wh ...
you taught my child that i am some limp dick < u > loser < /u > . who did n't < u > care < /u > about her pain .
so you became the hero . and i became the schmuck .
she was beaten , and bloodied , and it was going to go on , uni ...
worked . like a charm .
you had her < u > lie < /u > about that ... that fancy-boy < u > model < /u > !
aw .
you put filth in my child 's mouth .
right down to the ground . let 's get to it .
you are < u > defending < /u > what you did ?
is that what you 're worried about ? looking bad at the pta ?
actually . they 'll want annabelle 's mother .
give 'em my number .
because there 'll be , oh , 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so . and they 'll b ...
it does n't matter , i did n't tell h ...
now , 'limp dick ' , i know . what . is 'snowballing ' ?
do n't be too sure .
and i 'm going to win .
are we .
now we 're going to have a fight , you and i .
he looks familiar . did he do a calvin klein ad ?
looks nice enough to m ...
who in the world < u > is < /u > he ?
you really did n't have to come , you know . i 'd have brought them straight t ...
he wo n't discuss it . just calls it history .
is that what he told you ?
that thing you said before . pushing the guy sleeping next to you away . because of what you gave up for motherhood ...
took 28 hours . she just was n't sure about entering this world .
and her ... ?
somehow , his blanket always looked like a cape , even the nurse said that . he < u > loves < /u > to hear that story , over and over . how he was born a magician .
feeling the pressure ?
my advice to you ? do n't die .
that 's motherhood . that 's the job , with or without a career . i 'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness . they < u > need < /u > you to be happy .
i just want to spend time with them when i 'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or ...
i know you , huh ? the car pools , he measles , the pta . it 's not gon na be enough for you in the long run . you have to think long term .
yes . i made the choice that was right for me . and i do n't regret it . but even for me , there were days when i felt so lost , so invis- ible . and then i 'd hate myself for the kids not being enough .
it 's the same choice you made .
juggle it ! move the darkroom into your house . you 've got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway . do n't lose your confidence . do n't lose your edge .
hey , you have n't quit on you , i 'm sure as hell not gon na . i just mean , i 'm juggling a lot right n ...
you mean , after i 'm dead ?
it was just a job , there 'll be plenty of others .
do what you 've worked your whole life to do ?
it 's just not the right time t ...
no .
i 'm thinking . do i know you well enough to really chew you out ?
... go to the park . in the worst way .
hon , maybe your mom would like t ...
it 's < u > covered < /u > , okay ? i appreciate your concern . can i talk to her ?
yah ? well , even the best mom in the world , the smartest , the wisest , whatever . needs to know when to find a plan b. cos plan a < u > is < /u > not and < u > will < /u > n ...
thanks , but it 's under control .
can i say one thing ? i mean , the < u > last < /u > thing i want to do is inter- fere on the brad thing , b ...
how 's she doing with brad ?
yeh , she 's ... i 'll get you ben first , it 's past his bedti ...
eat your heart out . is annabelle there ?
what else ? keep on keepin ' on .
and you said ...
he 's relentless . a < u > major < /u > asshole .
i think my 'primo shit ' got left in my 'bellbottoms . '
the primo stuff is great for pain .
brad kovitsky .
you try to center on the big issues , y'know . what it 's all about . what this whole trip has meant . but then , the < u > really < /u > big issues keep swamping y ...
yeh , that 's bull . i 'm going for serene , they say some actually get there .
you look sick . but you look ... together . mentally tough .
i really look like shit .
it 's promising , this one . we 're upbeat .
so . hopeful .
it 's a mess , right now . that 's my project when i get back .
can i look at the pictures ?
beats me . ask your mom .
and you said ... ?
does n't < u > begin < /u > to describe it . i mean , you 've got cancer , < u > this < /u > is serious .
she 's devastated .
right . which is the whole < u > point < /u > of this 'going out ' thing , so one of them can dump the other one , and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy , without ever having to actually date .
oh , my god .
anyway . he walks up to her on lunch yard today . and tells her ... publicly ... that they 're 'breaking up . '
... going out , yeh . i had kids of my own , once .
as you may know , 'going out ' in the six grade does n't mean shit . they do n't actually < u > go < /u > to a movie or anywhere , they do n't even eat lunch together , it 's just a declaration to the world that they 're ...
toi . they 've been 'going out ' for two weeks .
moi ?
she was afraid you 'd make a big deal out of it .
she has n't mentioned this .
that . and . annabelle is over her head . with brad 'the dreamboat ' kovitsky .
you 're a cross-dresser .
so i have to tell you something in confidence ...
luke 's depo ran late . i promised i 'd take notes .
small world .
ironic , huh ?
okay , i 'm undeserving .
i have given them more < u > love < /u > and more < u > care < /u > every fifteen < u > minutes < /u > of their lives , than you could manage in the next fifty < u > years < /u > !
see , i know that .
they came out of my < u > body < /u > !
you are < u > marrying < /u > the < u > greatest < /u > guy who walks this < u > earth < /u > . who i have < u > loved < /u > from my < u > heart < /u > for twelve < u > years < /u > !
and cigarettes . i smoke , too .
how would you know < u > anything < /u > ?
i do n't , but ...
how the hell would you know ?
you bet you are .
you 're not dying .
life 's a trade-off . you get cancer , your hair falls out , but you < u > do < /u > get to smoke dope .
really . by what right ? six months of part-time screw-ups ?
i got used to ... thinking of them . as ... my kids too .
... it 's my problem , too .
then let him talks to me . we do n't need you to solve our prob ...
luke . ca n't live like that .
did i hear the word ...
we ca n't live like that .
bi-coastal parenting . happens every day . luke gets the kids every other summer , every other holiday , it 's not ideal , but people make it work , and ...
but i came here to ...
nobody likes a snoop .
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable ...
do n't flatter yourself .
look , you 've never liked me ...
you 're taking the kids . and moving to san francisco .
you what ?
you 're not working at random house , i talked to them .
my boss .
i was looking for annabelle 's book , and i found your tickets . and the note . from your new boss .
i do n't know wh ...
let 's ... hold up for a bit . it may not happen . our secret , okay ?
uh . have you told luke and the ki ...
hey , any help you need , we 'll cover .
... make some trips into the city . sometimes , overnight .
wowie . how wonderful !
... thinking of going back to random house . on a part-time basis .
not great . plus , i 've got things on my mind . you know .
you feeling all right ?
when i twisted hair like this it means i 'm intimidated by you ...
yes ?
jackie ?
she was angry at herself .
last week when she chopped her barbie 's bangs all to hell --
anxiety .
what about obsessively picking her split ends ?
no way . i told her two , three years , maybe , for such an expens ...
hey . at least it 's not an editing machine .
i 'm sorry , i just ...
it 's okay , it 's twenty minutes . the horse 'll be there .
sorry i 'm late , i got lost dropping ben off at kevin 's .
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish ?
not personally .
ben likes to be read to . do you know dr. seuss ... ?
why not just bring the whole toilet ?
bandaids for cuts . bandaids for new shoe blisters . packet of wash n dri 's . kleenex . sugar free lollipops , potty seat covers for public restrooms ...
fine , forget it .
i 'm already on thin ice . yesterday , i actually thought my boss was going to fire me .
however many . it 's not enough .
what ? and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders ? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors ?
i have an appointment this after- noon . i need someone to take them to the park .
i did it for her .
so why did y ...
those are < u > my < /u > children you 're practicing on . they deserve < u > first- < /u > rate care . every minute . of every night . and every day .
i need practice .
you 're not terribly good at taking care of h ...
she already hates me . you 've seen to that .
i did n't do it for you . believe me .
i did n't need you to take the blame for me , i 'm quite ...
i have a snoop .
i do n't recall inviting you .
i 'm sorry . look , i 'm not real comfortable being here , but ...
... in .
a court < u > order < /u > is gon na say that < u > woman < /u > is < u > never < /u > < u > alone < /u > with my children ! ever < u > again < /u > ! do you hear that ?
well , maybe they would if they thought it was okay , with y ...
i am not < u > here < /u > to make it easier for you . these are < u > my < /u > children . they do n't want to < u > be < /u > with you .
you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once . that woman has nothing more to do with my children .
jackie , if i thought for one moment ...
i 'm sorry i did n't mean to break your concentration . i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb ...
annabelle does n't really want to talk to you right now .
think twice . before you < u > ever < /u > pull that again .
yeh ?
of all the < u > cheap < /u > excuses . to break a child 's heart .
look , i ...
machines do not eat message .
you got to hell !
but it 's not on the schedule !
get out !
maybe the problem is your < u > kids < /u > . maybe they 're spoiled , coddled < u > brats < /u > !
oh and i do n't because i have a children ? ! the problem is you 're too self-involved to ever be a mother .
you 're damn right . i 'm gon na sick of your imperious bullshit . i never said i was betty fucking crocker . if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead ! i have a life !
you mean for you . a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family . she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time . and you think it 's best for her if every- one pretends it did n't happen ? this is n't going to work out .
no . i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards ?
i was in there in him .
i 'm sure that did n't upset her . everyone in our family takes showers .
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking .
< u > forgiveness ? < /u > for < u > what < /u > , exactly ?
... a ridiculously < u > expensive < /u > and < u > inappropriate < /u > item , which her father and i have already < u > told < /u > her she is < u > far < /u > too young to own . but < u > you < /u > apparently want to < u > buy < /u > her forgiveness , with ...
she 's been talking about this little editing machine , it 's only ...
nothing . look , i want to talk to you about ... well ... luke said to ask you ...
what did you do ?
maybe you could back off just a little bit --
what happened with annabelle ? has nothing i said gotten through to you ?
annabelle , how 's your video rep ...
what is this ? the betty ford center ?
we do n't have any coffee .
can i please have a cup of coffee ?
every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it 's switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday . it 's not that hard . did n't you have a mother ?
this is friday , her riding lesson is on tuesdays . i got it right here ...
how do you hold down a job ? it 's 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she 's missed her sunrise groom'n ride .
i 'm gon na get me a drink .
where you goin ' ?
how about the promises we make to our kids ? about < u > their < /u > future . do we shrug those off , just that easily ?
we make our lives , one step at a time . we do the best we can . the truth about the future ? a promise . is only a hope .
because you 've changed so much .
that 's not us .
'but keep dancing , and if you 're lucky , i might just never leave , who knows ? '
no , here 's ugly . 'i love < u > you < /u > , babe . it 's just our < u > life < /u > together i 'm not so sure about ... '
that 's a pretty ugly thing you just said .
no , she threw you out . what a difficult woman .
' ... i do n't know if i can make it . ' that 's what i said . but i did n't leave .
excuse me . 'things are so confusing for me , jack . our life feels too comfortable , too safe , too predict- able . it 's a partnership , it 's juggling schedules . when i think of playing that out , every day , for the rest of my life ... '
restless .
by way of saying you were unhappy .
i told her i loved her .
let me put it this way . hell , no .
can we go sit somewhere ?
what do you call it ? you told her you had doubts .
she called it a fight . < u > the < /u > fight .
' ... the kids have camp . their friends are here . over there , i 'll just be shopping in a language i do n't even know . my life , and the kids ' lives , are n't here to service your mid-life crisis . ' did it go like that ?
... while she watched the kids . then , you booked this flat in paris for your family 's summer . but she said ...
i needed some time away .
you took a fishing trip with the boys . liked it so much , you took another .
why in the world would she t ...
imagine my relief . so what 's for dinner ?
well , they will be .
just like to make sure . that your past . and my future . are real different .
hold your applause . we 're not having fun , here .
what a great surpri ...
i made that paella you liked . it 's on the stove .
no problem .
i know that .
she 's not gon na die .
great , wallow in guilt , you < u > sure < /u > you 're not jewish ?
they 're my kids .
are you hungry ? you could make us something ?
it 's anna sui , you should be doing it .
it 's just an assignment .
it 's no biggie .
well , i think you should tell him you changed your mi ...
what 's eight , ten years ? hell , you 'll still be ambulatory . i think .
rache , it may take time .
everything 's gon na work out . the kids and i ... we 're going to love each other .
because i ca n't hurt anyone like this ever again .
okay ... is that the good thing or the bad thing ?
it 's forever you know .
i think so too ...
i think so ... what do you think ?
oh my god . are you serious ?
you have n't done < u > one < /u > goddam thing to make any of this easier ...
rache , get out of th ...
why are you taking this out on < u > him < /u > ?

hey , i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo ...
not yet .
uh . annabelle 's video report has been switched again .
get ready . to get < u > really < /u > mad .
you know i do n't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot ... your ex-wife 's doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just do n't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long ! jesus what did you see in her ? i do n't get it -- i just do n't get it .
no you do n't . and i 'm not gon na screw with my kids heads right now --
oh right ... so it 's just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it 's pretty simple cause i just do n't understand ...
it 's complicated for jackie . it 's complicated for me ... you do n't have kids -- you do n't understand --
really ? look in your ex-wife 's eyes .
nobody 's telling them to hate you --
and what you 're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
they do n't hate you --
look . i know they hate me .
i know how responsible , caring adults parent children . i 'm bribe 'em . but 'em a dog or something . maybe a doberman .
but you 're not good at this . not yet . i 'm sorry .
but ? but what ?
i trust you of course i do but --
you do n't trust me to be alone with them .
ca n't handle them myself is what you mean . ca n't .
you do n't need to . i do n't expect you to handle them yourself .
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
just a babysitter -- i mean ... you 're working ...
for what ?
anyway , i thought ... while i 'm gone ... maybe i 'll hire in some help .
jesus .
we have the kids this weekend , so ...
so i 'll have to order in ?
i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition . i might not be back until saturday .
yeh , it 's cheaper .
you 'd rather spoil our walk home .
i did n't want to spoil our supper ...
uh-oh . i mention marriage , all of a sudden ... ve < u > haff < /u > to ta ...
we have to talk .
the way you cook . if you could make love , i 'd marry you .
well , it was n't a reduction like you do it ! boiling down half a ton of bones ...
it was a veal stock , i thi ...
okay , if they 're going to < u > have < /u > a sauce , put something < u > in < /u > it besides flour and chicken broth ...
tucker has n't penned ben 's present yet -- it wo n't be too much longer .
something came up . c'mon ben ! i 've got a shoot at three ...
in seven years jackie 's never missed one of tucker 's parties . where is she ?
no . i 'm doing it behind her back .
does jackie know this ?
hi , i 'm here to pick up ben .
hmmm ... do i know any ... personally ... ?
well , i 'm supposed to watch schindler 's list for homework . the movie 's like almost four hours . and then i 'm supposed to write a report on survivors . you know any survivors , dad ?
oh , yeah ?
we 're studying the holocaust in social studies .
man , i am out of here ! this family is so fucked !
you heard me : leave the table !
what ?
out ! leave the table !
he is n't .
what if he is ?
do n't ever say that .
maybe he 's gay .
i do n't know what 's wrong with that kid .
thanks , scoob .
no prob . i 'm cool .
and like , do n't take this the wrong way ... i mean , i 'm cool ... but ... you know ... i 've got a good reputation at school and , well ... i really do n't want it ruined .
oh .
you know ... stanley ...
like what ?
there are some rumors ...
what ?
there 's something i need to talk about with you .
hey . what 's up ?
hey .
but that could 've happened to him . or to me , if i 'd been alive . or you .
even though it was only his cousins that were killed ?
well , he did . with his family . but his cousins , they had to stay and they were all killed . and if he 'd stayed , he would have been killed . so in my book he 's a survivor .
but i thought he came over to america before the war .
well , no . but he had to escape the nazis .
he was in a concentration camp ?
well , technically your zeda is a survivor .
he 's vegetarian , does n't do sports ...
marty , ignore him .
tv talk-show host , ok. you were at sidekick eight seconds ago , then tv talk-show host . you 'll be a latin dictator in a bout a minute .
be your sidekick , you know , and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host .
ahh ... tell me . what do you want to do for me ? what 's your idea ?
well , i was thinking ... i might work for you .
and thank you for dressing up for us . this is very classy . tell us . what kind of professional plans do you have ? what 's in your future ?
great to be here .
nice to have you here .
thank you .
welcome to the show , scooby .
really ? well , all right ! let 's take a look at the television and see how we look .
i 'll be your guest !
i 'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show . any suggestions ?
conan o'brien ? whoa ! what are you doing here ?
hey , scooby ! how 's it going ?
well then , when you get older you can do something about it .
sometimes i feel like my parents do n't love me .
it is when you love someone , and they do n't love you . and then you do something about it .
consuelo , what is rape exactly ?
for rape and murder .
why was he on death row ?
i know !
but really , you never know .
i am sure .
but still , you ca n't be sure .
he was n't .
maybe he was and you just did n't know it .
jesus was not bad .
maybe it 's for the besti mean , if he was guilty of doing something wrongpeople who are bad should be killed . do n't you think so ?
poison gas .
how did they execute him ?
he was executed . he was on death row and then he was executed .
oh . how did it happen ?
he 's dead .
gee , i did n't even know you had any children . but why are you so upset about jesus ?
my grandchild-baby .
you have a bay ?
my baby .
who is jesus ?
my jesus
consuelo , i 'm sorry , but you know if you do n't speak english i ca n't understand you .
mi jesus esta muerto !
speak english .
mi jesusmi jesus
yes , you are . i can tell . what 's the matter ?
no .
consuelo . are you crying ?
but it 's not like real work . this is just babysitting .
this is work .
but when you 're not . like now . what do you like to do ?
i 'm always working .
but like , what do you like to do when you 're not working ?
no , mikey .
hmmm . but , consuelo , even though your poor , do n't you have any hobbies or interests or anything ?
i 'm still poor .
must 've been hard being poor .
we had to work . my family was poor .
were n't there high schools in el salvador ?
i did not go to high school .
when i 'm in high school i 'm not going to play any football . i 'm just going to concentrate on class rank . what did you do in high school ?
no .
but do you really believe in god ? and heaven , hell and angels and all kind of stuff ?
it was god 's will .
wow . why did your parents have so many children ? i mean , if they were poor , would n't it be better to have just one or two ?
four brothers and five sisters .
really ? how many ?
yes .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , mikey ?
consuelo ?
i do n't know . maybe they 'll like it .
what 's an audience going to tell you ?
well , i need to see this with an audience !
we 're not ready !
hip alternative types who will understand the process better
we 're not ready .
ok , then we can invite serious intellectual types .
i dunno , toby . we really have a long way to go . you still need a lot more footage , and it 's probably a little premature to start screening
ok , you 're right , you 're right you know , we need to screen what we 've gotinvite some regular people , just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this .
i mean , why are you making this documentary if you ca n't treat your subject with appropriate gravity ?
nothing , i guess
you 've got a family tragedy on your hands . will you tell me what 's funny about that ? about a kid in a coma ?
no , no , no . no exploitation . this is seriousbut do n't you find it a little funny too , at the same time ?
i mean , without this footage , without this rigorous documentation , it would feel like exploitation .
yes , i knowbut still , it should be somewhat entertaining .
this is entertainment you 're making , toby . this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has , with this brady crisis , evolved into something much richer and more provocative .
you think so ? you do n't think that this might not be a little dry ?
this is definitely better .
thanks . i 'll tell mike . well , it 's still just a beginning . i know i can ... dig deeper .
the camerawork 's nice .
yes , i do . i love them !
no , you do n't .
you 're showing how superior you are to your subject . toby no , but i like my subject . i like these people .
i 'm not making fun . i 'm showing it as it really is .
well , i 'm not really sure what you 're trying to say . it 's funny , i suppose . but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are .
so whaddya think ?
550 verbal , 520 math . and i 'm only in fifth grade !
what ?
i was looking through scooby 's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests . guess what score i got ?
yes , mikey ?
mom ?
boys , take napkins ... napkins ...
twinkeys !
i 'm serious ! what happens if he blows up the school ?
do n't even joke about that !
of course , honey . come in bed with us . come on .
sure ! ...
he 's right .
look , we 're not suckers . everyone else is out there doing the same thing .
it 's all about who you know .
you know , you have to . sometimes you just have to , toby .
we used pull .
do n't worry , he does n't mean money .
not to be crass , but what do we get out of this ?
you started filling out your college applications yet ?
marty ...
got a lot of homework ?
steak 's really good tonight . scooby good .
the sats , knucklehead . scooby i 'm not taking them .
what 's tomorrow ?
ready for tomorrow ?
fine .
hi , scooby ! how was school today ?
but then , in a sense , since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe ... if it were n't for hitler , none of us would have been born .
well ... yes . if it had n't been for hitler , he would n't have had to leave europe . we would have been ... european .
how was the class ?
we did the same thing last year also .
i dunno .
what are you going to do ?
my cd case like totally collapsed . i 'm gon na have to recatalogue all weekend . hey . can you pass the salad over .
is everything ok ?
was anyone in my room today ?
i admit it - i was scared ! i was shocked , in fact , by what he said . and he 's so ... convincing . i 'm sorry if i let you down , but really , i still say he 's just one opinion . i do n't even like his books that much . they 're all so aggressively confrontational . i do n't care if he 's won the pulitzer prize .
well , i sure did n't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered .
that 's not fair ! i was honest ! just because i was n't sucking up like that bitch catherine .
patronizing fuck ! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i would n't have read it . i knew it was shit . but - idiot ! - i believed you !
marcus ... you 'll write something better next time !
your story was terrible !
you know he hated my story also .
what the fuck are you talking about ? what 's ok ?
do n't be so upset . it 's ok ...
what do you want ?
look , vi , i do n't blame you . you feel you feel pity now . the pleasure is n't there any more . the kinkiness has gone ... you 've become kind .
i was never much of a sweater . you know that .
you 've lost interest ... you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex .
marcus , i 'm tired . that 's all .
you 're tired of me . i can tell .
you 'll read it in class tomorrow . surprise me . anyway , i have to go . i promised melinda i 'd help her with her oral .
so you do n't want to hear my new ending ?
i think you should leave it the way it was . it was good .
but it wo n't make any sense if you hear it out of context .
well then , maybe you should just read the ending .
well , actually , it 's the same , but longer . i think it 's better . more ... raw .
oh . what happens now ?
well , i changed the ending a little .
you mean , again ?
i can read it to you .
huh ?
hey , you want to hear my short story now ?
... but mr livingston , are n't you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism ?
i think scooby 's like a lot of kids . he just hit aa speed bump . now he 's gon na find his way , his path is gon na be cleared , and i think he 's gon na continue his education at a good college . and everybody else is gon na be happy .
i have a cousin . very big giver to the alumni fund .
but what kind of pull did you have ?
yeah ... how do we know we wo n't be exploited ?
oh , i know , i know that . well , sharing your story , your ups and downs , and so forth , can i hope , be an illuminating experience .
'cause scooby does have a quality that i 've been looking for , a quality that is emblematic of american today . it 's part disillusionment , part hope ...
reconceive .
oh , well , i do n't have them yet , but
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds .
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this ?
you 're absolutely right . the focus is on the college admissions process today .
which is it ? you got ta keep your focus straight .
tired of this shit ...
ok .
do n't screw around with me . you know what i 'm talking about . you 're taking those sats . you 're taking those sats or your cd collection is history . you 're taking those sats and you 're going to college . you 're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair , but buddy your taking them .
whaddya wan na talk about ?
we have to talk .
yeah ?
scooby ?
man , it 's just , like , conversation .
get the hell outta here !
just the same .
the same . same as what ?
the same .
so ? how was school today ?
dad , i 'm trying to figure things out right now , ok ? it 's like , really hard , and i 'm just listening to some old elton john and ...
what do you know ?
whaddya mean you do n't know ? you either got a lot or you do n't . what 's not to know ?
i dunno .
i 'm going in there .
fuck !
sure , dad .
yeah , uh , listen . why do n't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit ? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment .
gee , you 're home early !
come here , give me a hug !
hi , dad !
hey , mikey !
ok !
hey , mikey . you wan na get some ice cream ?
ok. stay there . i 'll be right back .
yeah . sure go ahead . hypnotize me .
you 're welcome . dad ? would you let me try hypnotizing you now ?
thanks .
i do n't think there 's any hope , either . i was just trying to make you feel better .
mikey , there 's optimism , and then there 's stupidity . it 's a very fine line .
maybe he 's that one in a million !
one in a million recover .
dad ? do you think that brady will ever get better ?
yeah , well , mikey , listen up . cause here 's a lesson : life 's not fair .
mom , it 's not fair if brady can say the f-word and i ca n't .
maybe he 's building a bomb ... just like- !
i just want to know what the hell he 's doing in his room that 's so interesting he does n't come down for dinner .
nigger , fuck me hard ! ! ! ...
again ! !
nigger , fuck me hard ! ! ...
again !
nigger , fuck me hard !
say , 'nigger , fuck me hard ! '
fuck me hard !
'fuck me hard ! '
nigger .
say , 'nigger . '
... gger .
... gger .
ni ...
say , ni ...
oh , bu ... uh ... i ca n't say that .
take off your top .
it 's a really nice place you have . is the rent high ?
thanks .
it 's over there .
thank you for being honest .
no .
oh . do you think i have a potential as a writer ?
i 'm not 'going out ' with catherine .
are n't you going out with catherine ? i 'm sorry . it 's none of my business . i did n't mean ...
maybe . she 's ok .
thank you . so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer .
you have beautiful skin .
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus 's story . it is a piece of shit .
that 's good .
good . 'cause i ... um ... i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was ...
you 're not .
can i join you ?
uh huh .
yeah , um , then ... are you alone ?
well , now you have .
i 'm sorry . i did n't mean , i just did n't expect to run into you here , that 's all .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing here ?
hello , vi .
i dunno . see if i have any connections .
ah-hah . and how is it you hope to achieve this goal ?
well , i mean ... i wan na be on tv . maybe have a talk show or something . like conan . or early letterman .
c'mon . talk to me . tell me what you 're thinking .
i dunno ...
'ok . ' so you just do n't care . let me ask you , not as your guidance counselor , but ... as a friend : what do you want to do with your life ? i mean , what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have ?
ok .
all right , scooby , let 's not beat around the bush . with your attitude , you 're not going to get in anywhere .
i hate reading .
none at all ? how about those 'underground ' comics ?
no .
any books you like to read for fun ?
no , not really .
maybe she has caller id .
ok. bye .
yeah , sure .
listen , toby , i ca n't really talk right now . do you mind if i call you back ?
wow , that really is great . in a few years , who knows , maybe they 'll want to be in my documentary !
eight , six , and four .
great . how old are they ?
three .
how many ?
yeah .
huh . kids ?
yeah .
yeah ... so you 're um ... you 're married ?
oh . tired of 'life in the fast lane ' ?
yeah . but not any more .
yeah ... um ... so anyway , tell me . what about you ? i 'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies .
that 's good .
hunh .
uh , well , anyway , so i 'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia . kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology . i wrote to derrida to see if he 'd like to do the narration . but everything 's still kind of in development at this point .
well , but it was so long ago . we were so different back then ...
i do .
oh , i do n't remember that ...
yeah . you did n't wan na take me to the prom .
n-not yet . i 'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers . geez , remember when we were teenagers ?
oh ? anything i might have seen ?
i 'm a documentary filmmaker .
that 's good . so then what do you do now ?
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while , drove a cab to pay the rent , but , i mean , that was like - i mean , i have some dignity .
that 's too bad .
well , um , i kind of let things go on this novel i 'd been really into - i mean , the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt . i mean , really , it 's finished .
anything i might know about ?
yeah , well , then it got me writing , so that was a good thing .
oh , that 's too bad .
yeah , well , it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off , so , uh ... so i dropped out .
i believe it .
well , i went to law school , if you can believe that .
oh . so what did you do after you gave up on acting ?
oh , no , not any more . no , um , i kind of came to terms with myself , i realized i had done what i had to do . and it was time to move on .
um , well , yeah . so are you still acting ?
so . look at where we are : the year 2000 ! can you believe it ? i mean , did you ever think we would actually make it ?
yeah .
oh , yeah , well ... um ... i was just calling because , well , i was wondering if you still remembered me , which i guess you do ...
but ... you called .
that 's what i was gon na ask you .
so what 's going on ?
great !
great !
oh , fine . how are you ?
toby - ? oh , hi ! how are you ?
toby oxman .

hello , is this pam ?
hello ?

i mean ...
yeah . i know .
you know ... i like you .
yeah ?
scooby ?
you should be .
i know . i 'm sorry . i 'm just ... a little nervous , i do n't know why .
i 'm not an idiot , man . i watch tv .
scooby , do n't ! be careful !
no , i do n't think so ...
is it loaded ?
i know .
gee , your dad 's smart .
it 's my dad 's he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet .
how 'd you get it ?
thanks .
pretty cool , stanley .
do n't be . your movie 's a hit .
oh , my god , scooby ! i 'm so sorry ... i 'm so , so sorry ...
oh .
yeah . he went to harward .
he did ?
uh , scooby , now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all , like conan o'brien , but did you know even he went to college ?
i dunno . i 'd like to be good at something . it does n't have to be tv . i mean , it could be movies ... anything . i 'd be willing to direct .
what is most important to you ?
thanks man .
sureumyeah , as soon as i have a screening i 'll let you know .
can i see what you have so far ?
uh , yeah , we 're getting there .
hey , um , toby ? i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished ?
200 verbal/710 math . kinda weird , i know . but i think they thought it was , like , good-weird .
but what did you get on your sats ?
prnceton .
so where 'd you get in ?
so like , yeahi caved in . i mean , i had to . my parents , they 're like still really depressed about brady . so i wrote the bullshit essay . filled out the applications , did the interviewsy'know , i figure i can always drop out .
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest .
whoopee .
actually , there is some interest from the sundance channel .
doubt it .
yeah , well , it 's possible they would be interested in it .
is this to like get into sundance ?
well ... it 's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine .
what for ?
well , no . i 'm doing one on high school students , in fact .
oh . you mean , like , blair witch project ?
no ... actually , i 'm a documentary filmmaker ?
you a pervert ?
times up !
well , i-i hope that -- that --
uh-oh ! do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point , or does washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games ?
y-yes --
does that include helen filmore , united states congresswoman ?
th-th-they 'll kill one hostage every hour until it is --
twenty-five-million ! and what will they do if the money is n't delivered ?
th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash -- or chemco will be destroyed .
henry , what exactly are these crazed gunmen demanding ?
i do n't know -- look ! they can get in now , man ! we got no one left to guard it !
is he with the girl ?
there is n't anyone ! he 's opened that whole sector now !
well get someone down there !
we got trouble . that bodyguard son- of-a-bitch has them running all over the field -- just took out three on the north end !
listen man , i do n't need this shit --
i now understand the expression `` you get what you pay for ! '' a bunch of chumps !
i do n't know what hit us ! we had them trapped on the stairwell . they could be anywhere now .
i guess not cooper ...
looks like you 're not going to make that dinner after all ...
well cooper ...
well filmore --
rule two : without alternative , use yourself as a shield .
what about rule one : never let the person you are protecting out of your sight !
you 're talking about committing suicide !
because i 'll be firing at them .
they probably have guards on the roof -- and they 're gon na be firing at me -- not you ! atkins what makes you so sure ?
what are you talking about ?
i 'm going first . taking the fire . if we go out together we 're all dead !
there 's the fence ...
now what ?
used to filmore , used to .
you 're a lot like my father , cooper ... you think with your heart .
by the time i got back to the party our ambassador was face-down , in a bed of bloody azaleas .
what happened ?
i drew my gun , ran in the direction of the cries ... violating the first rule of service ... i let the ambass- ador out of my sight .
yeah ? ...
cooper ...
no but you did n't defend him either ! did n't want to rock the boat . guess the ride was too smooth . filmore i was acting under legal counsel !
let me tell you something cooper ! i never once bad-mouthed him during all those months --
what do you think ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
after leizburg , he stuck his neck out to defend me . he 's loyal to the end . even if it 's not -- politically correct at the time .
what do you mean ?
you should listen your old man more often . he 's got principles .
he 's a very stubborn man sometimes ...
i was n't angry with you i was angry with him .
forget about it .
what happened !
let 's move it we got company !
yeah and we do n't have much ammo either !
we do n't have time !
-- be prepared .
we 're outta here --
what now ?
who 's got matches ?
what are we going to do !
just the soda , please . cooper heads down the hall . filmore watches him leave , sighs , then turns and smiles at the general manager :
anything else ? maybe a sandwich ?
look cooper i do n't care what my father says , if you embarrass me here you 're going to regret it , understand ?
i 'm not arguing . i 'm just telling you what the deal is -- congresswoman .
just get me a coke and do n't argue with me , ok ?
if you 're working for me you 're going to do what i tell you .
i got ta keep you alive -- it 's in my contract .
what are you going to do , cooper , throw yourself on a bunsen burner ? it 's a bunch of businessmen touring a lab . we 'll be out in no time .
i said i 'll lead .
why ? are we going dancing ?
i 'll lead .
the maintenance hatch -- it takes us outside the building !
where does it lead ?
that 's it ! up ahead !
we would n't have made it out without you . filmore or without you .
it 's nothing to worry about .
how 's the arm ?
good ...
i do n't see why they would n't be .
are the labs in operation ?
we 're on sublevel six . we 'll pass some labs and then we 'll hit the stairwell --
how well do you know this place ?
even better .
i have a lighter !
i said i do n't want any , goddammit !
i insist ...
i do n't want any ...
come on , drink up .
shut up !
you see , it paid off -- you broke away from the old guard , congresswoman . it wo n't be long till they 're calling you senator filmore --
yes , you should .
i suppose ... you think i should thank you .
like where -- in your dreams ?
i know you 're not too happy at this point . it 's too bad we were n't able to meet elsewhere , under different circumstances ...
it seems to me we are just sailing away . they have n't sunk us yet , have they ? besides , do n't you worry your pretty little head about that . it 's all been taken care of .
you understand that they 're watching our every move right now -- you think you 're just going to sail away ?
you got it all backwards , helen -- but that 's ok , you work for the government ...
you 're going to pay for this ...
i hope you do n't mind all this -- it 's just that the networks will eat it up , you know ...
hey now ! no cussing on tv ! well in closing i 'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour . one is my perky co-anchor here , and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people -- people just like you and me !
go fuck yourself ...
i do n't know . if you gave me a reason to ...
are you going to kill us ?
enjoying the tour so far ?
you ca n't think like that ! we 're watching them like a hawk -- he 's bound to trip up , make one false move --
she 's as good as gone ...
looks like richter is n't acting alone -- he 's heading into some dangerous waters .
he 's in there ...
what about cooper -- where is he ?
chemco 's been developing nerve gas ?
why the hell did n't you tell us this was at stake !
we have a special forces squadron out of thailand surrounding the compound as we speak .
good .
we 've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions .
well ?
the transmission is an hour old ...
she 's still alive .
came over the satellite . we 're keeping the bird clear should they call back .
they were probably topping off a docked tanker while he stalled for time -- without anyone being the wiser ...
what !
he would n't take it on the helicopters . he 'd transport it through pipelines that connect chemco to the waterfront ...
how much do they have ?
well , it 's a binary formula -- a precise amount of two separate chemicals must be exposed to the nitrogen in the atmosphere simultaneously for it to work .
what the hell is it , anyhow ?
apparently , this project is -- unique . but it 's heavily protected -- all formulas are heavily codified !
i have n't been briefed on any such thing !
chemco makes many things senator ! we were under government contract !
mister myers it is a chemical plant ! there are a number of volatile compounds -- but they are safely stored away ...
is there anything in there that can blow ? we have to be ready for any contingency --
i assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it would n't be shelved in a lab somewhere ...
what do they have in there that 's so valuable ? a cure for aids , a cure for cancer ?
what do you mean ?
so , what are we looking at white ?
i do n't think you -- grasp -- the situation , mr. myers .
the ball is in richter 's court . but we 're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people -- we 're gon na stop the son-of- a-bitch !
and what exactly do they intend to do ?
i 'll let the senator tell you .
who 's ryan cooper ?
i 'm sure you 'll figure it out .
and -- of course there is the human cost , which is incalculable .
chemco is willing to deal with him , meet his demands . i can have the money there in an hour .
this was taken when richter was arrested in washington state , 1985. he was charged with interstate arms trafficking , skipped bail , and has since been a fugitive .
excellent .
we 're almost done piping in directly to the olympia . should have it all in about an hour or so .
what 's happening at the waterfront ?
you 're fucking crazy richter -- you know that ?
i want the girl . i do n't care about the rest -- but a us congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy . we 'll make headlines all over the world ...
what are you so worked up about jack ? fuck 'em -- we do n't need 'em .
where the hell could they have gone !
excellent ... excellent !
kz ... 7-0 ... 7-0 ... nine . it checks out .
richter-we got a problem !
something tells me you do n't want to be on tv , friend .
i know what i 'm here for-you do n't need to remind me .
of course it 's codified ! each number probably corresponds to a compound . have them pull every compound from the lab and compare it to the codes till you figure it out -- that 's what you 're here for .
i 'm in to the directory but they 've codified the stockpile -- numerically .
have you broken it yet ? we 've got six more heads and that means six more hours .
we 're secured . takeover team is in position and accounted for .
how goes the roll call ?
the thing weighs more than a ton -- you want to roll up your sleeves and try it ? !
get your men to do it !
we ca n't -- it 's power driven !
drop the anchor !
if i do n't get power up we are !
are we adrift --
you know , when we reach kompong som --
dissent ?
well , there was uh , a little dissent about the amount of the bonus --
why should i worry ? is there a problem ?
my crew is going to work alongside with your men , do n't worry -- we 're a team !
captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request .
are you hungry ? we can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley .
agreed -- let 's move it .
i say we head out .
good .
gotcha . we 've been filling barrels all day -- we 've got hell of a stockpile .
our traveler 's insurance , you know what i mean ?
there 's enough in one vial ...
what does that mean ?
they must have got their hands on a test vial !
how much of this shit do they have , white ! !
of the separate chemicals -- i do n't know , uh , offhand --
we 've ... been developing a product ... kz 70709 .
just what the hell is he talking about ?
oh , yes , that 's right .
excuse me , mister president , but you forgot to give me my camera back .
we have many splendidly deep mines in our country .
goodbye , mister ambassador .
and now , mister president , i must return at once to my embassy to communicate this reassuring news to the premier .
do n't you realize that despite your incredible distrust and suspicion , that in fact , you place a far greater trust in us than inspection would require ? you trust us not to cause a war accidentally - and , of course , we are obliged to place the same trust in you .
and surely you do n't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons .
surely , you do n't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same ?
i know nothing of the sort !
that 's nonsense , and you know it !
bah ! all you wanted to do was spy in our country !
this dreadful accident could never have happened if your government had n't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control ! !
how dare you talk to me in this manner ?
it is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man .
damn you , de sade ! you know as well as i do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual , whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country .
allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people .
yes ?
the report is entirely untrue . i can assure you of that .
the source was ... shall we say , completely reliable .
that 's preposterous ! we have no such program !
but , finally , one factor tipped the scales . we received information from a very re- liable source that your country was going to build one .
first of all , economic reasons . it was cheap . the entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs . it also seemed ideal in most other respects . it was terrifying , convincing , automatic , and extremely simple to understand .
mister ambassador , what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon ?
it is buried somewhere in the grudd mountains .
where is this ... thing ?
our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices , jacketed in cobalt-thorium-g would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape . in ten months the earth would be as dead as the moon .
well , it has been explained to me that , if you add a thick cobalt-thorium-g jacket to a nuclear device , the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years .
i 'll hold this , if you do n't mind . you can have it back when you leave .
i am sorry . sub-miniature photography is my hobby . it 's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative .
what 's the meaning of this ?
did you get that , kulnick ?
if he 's not there , try ... 87 - 43 - 56 .
at his office in the capitol .
where are you trying to reach him ?
yes , of course .
i have your word , mister president ?
do n't be ridiculous .
the food - you would n't put - anything in it , would you ?
now , mister ambassador . in a very few moments we should have premier belch on the phone . i intend to tell him exactly what has happened . i merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him .
thank you , admiral .
moffo !
possibly some coffee ?
certainly - how about some breakfast ?
can i have a glass of water ?
all right , mister ambassador ! but you must treat general `` buck '' schmuck with the respect due him .
war-mongering bully ! do n't think you 're going to intimidate me !
you will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people .
please be calm , ambassador de sade .
one , two ... three , four ... five ... why you , dirty , stinking ...
that 's right , fella .
my seven body orifices ? ? ? ?
see ! see , i told you .
please , mister president , i am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation . here is the only other camera i have left .
it 's not a he , general . it was an article in the `` times '' about a year and a half ago .
you mean you 'll tell us his name ? ? ?
perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source ?
ah , but if we were able to untrigger it , that would be defeating its purpose . all our enemies would have to do , would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions . we would bluff , naturally , but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it . now we can say : there is no point trying to intimidate us , we do n't control the doomsday machine .
then all you have to do is untrigger it .
you 're absolutely right . we would n't . no sane nation ever would . that 's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically .
mister president , i ca n't buy this malarkey ; they would n't set the damn thing off . why should they ?
naturally . it would kill us just as surely even if we set it off in your country . but this way we know it 's safe , and we do n't have the problem of delivering it .
do you mean to say you 'd set it off in your own country ?
what do you think of this , mister president ? i told you we should n't let him in here .
give that back to me .
i caught you red-handed , mister ambassador .
do n't you dare touch me ! what the devil do you think you 're doing ?
mister president , are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this ?
premier belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie .
who the hell do you think you are , sir ? ? ?
now , snap out of it , fella !
it might still be worth trying riki-tiki- tavi . r ... t ... t ... there 's only three combinations of -- t ... t ... r , or t ... r ... t ...
get a grip on yourself , major !
the three-letter code group . or maybe some combination of the three letters . p ... o ... e , or p ... e ... o , or e ... o ... p ... let 's see , there would be six possible combinations .
what are you talking about , major ?
i think that just might be it ! although it could be riki-tiki-tavi .
why are you saying that phrase over and over again ?
come in ... come in ... peace on earth ... peace on earth ... yes ...
major ? ... major ? i 'm colonel `` bat '' guano , 701 battalion .
colonel , remember , a reprimand from the president can be pretty serious to a career officer ... just a second , operator , i know i have it somewhere .
that 's government property , major .
operator ... how much would the call be station-to-station ? ... thirty-five cents cheaper ? ... i 'd still be short twenty cents ... just a second , operator ... colonel , shoot the lock off the coke machine . there 's bound to be enough change in there .
well , i 'm general ripper 's executive officer . he 'll want to talk to me .
so what ?
he wanted to talk to general ripper , did n't he ?
what about the president ?
wait a minute . the president ! ! that 's it ! the president ! ! !
you 've wasted enough of my time , fella .
okay , colonel . but look , there 's a pay phone just outside in the hall . maybe that works , huh ? maybe it 'll work ? what do you think ?
on your feet , fella . i 've got to get outside and see how my men are .
look , colonel . maybe it 's too late . maybe they 've sent air command in already . but we 've got to try to con- tact somebody .
now look , i 'm picking up this ordinary telephone . see ? ... hello ? ... hello ? ... nuts , the lines must still be disconnected . the general had us disconnect ...
sure ... sure , colonel . now look , i 'm picking up the phone ... nice and slow . right ? ... hello ? ... hello ? hello ? ... hello ? ... gee , it must be edad . probably the lines were hit during the fighting .
okay , fella . but just move slow and do n't do anything that might surprise me .
look , colonel . you keep me covered , but let me just pick up this red telephone that connects to air command headquarters . okay ? ... i wo n't play any tricks on you ... okay ?
they told me , major . and i did n't hear anything about any atomic attack .
did n't they tell you ?
you must think i 'm an awful sap , major . just sit down , fella , and keep your hands on the desk !
look , general ripper went off his rocker and ordered the 843rd bomb wing to attack with h-bombs .
sure i do . there was some kind of mutiny on the base , and you killed general ripper .
colonel , do n't you know what 's going on ?
do n't worry , major . your rights will be fully protected .
look , colonel . i 've got to talk to somebody at air command .
we 'll have to leave that up to the c.i.d . boys , wo n't we , major ?
look , i did n't shoot him !
what happened , major ? some kind of private beef between the two of you ?
what ?
do you have any witnesses , major ?
well , you ca n't do that because he 's dead .
i did that for your own good , fella . now i 'm not going to pull rank on you . when this is over , i 'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing . right now my orders are to locate general ripper and put him on the phone with the president .
now look here , miss pietraszkiewicz , this is air command headquarters calling .
ceida pietraszkiewicz ... p ... i ... e ... t ... r ... a ... s ... z ... k ... i ... e ... w ... i ... c ... z .
what did you say ?
ceida pietraszkiewicz .
what is your name , young lady ?
i 'm sorry , sir . general schmuck is asleep and he is n't taking calls until eight-thirty .
well , that 's the funny part of it , too , sir . it does n't show a damned thing .
does the threat board show anything ?
i know it sounds crazy , sir , but we tried , and nobody answers any of the telephones .
well , that 's ridiculous . if the teleprinter and radio links are out of order , just pick up a phone and pay for a call .
then why bother me with this nonsense ? get in touch with the base commander .
no , sir .
colonel , you 're not drunk , are you , man ?
general schmuck , we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from burpelson air force base , hq 843rd wing . it was apparently directed to their wing on air- borne alert . it decoded as - wing attack , plan-r .
i did n't say anything . what 's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour , colonel ?
what did you say , sir ?
go back to sleep , baby .
yes ! who the hell is this ?
general schmuck ?
yes !
i 'm afraid i 'll have to ask you to take the film out .
just a second , sir . he 's got films of the war room in that thing !
buck , when i told you to give them right up to the top , you said we could n't insult a general officer by asking him to pass a test to see if he 's a psycho .
be fair , mister president . did n't we initiate the human reliability tests for all personnel handling nuclear weapons ?
damn it ! damn it ! i 've been telling you all for years you 've got too damned many psychoes in the service .
not exactly , sir . you see , colonel puntrich at air command hq received a call from him about twenty minutes ago . he asked general ripper if he had issued the go-code and the attack order , and general ripper said : `` sure , the orders came from me . they 're on their way in , and i advise you to get the rest of air command in after them . my boys will give you the best kind of start , and you sure as hell wo n't stop them now . '' then he hung up .
you are n't sure !
to be perfectly honest , mister president , we really are n't sure .
may i be stupid enough to inquire why in hell the base commander of the 843d bomb wing did a thing like that ? ? ?
yes , sir . he issued attack orders to --
general schmuck ?
well , sir , about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders , general jack d. ripper , sent out attack orders to the thirty-four b-90 's of the 843rd bomb wing , under his command .
what kind of trouble ?
well , mister president .
yes , sir .
i want him upped to brigadier general , and recomended for the d.s.c .
i did n't speak to him , sir . but colonel `` bat '' guano was in command of the special service battalion , so i would imagine he did .
that certainly would be a problem , sir .
what do you suppose is going to happen if general ripper 's planes start bombing their targets ?
but that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt , mister president .
you see , you knew the answer all the time , general .
well ... i suppose penetrate the base by force .
under the circumstances , general , what would you think they should do ?
thank you , sir . but what shall i tell them to do if they are denied entrance ?
that 's a very wise deduction , general .
well , sir , they may not allow the special service troops to enter the base .
i am aware of what a condition red alert implies .
under a condition red alert , the base will probably be sealed off and defended by the base security troops .
yes ?
yes , sir . one thing , mister president .
and lastly , all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded . they can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs . air police will have lists of all owners .
yes , sir .
now , as soon as you 've done that , double- up on all base security teams . our enemies are plenty smart , and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs .
thank you , sir .
you 're a good officer , major , and you 're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention .
no , sir . i 'm just bringing the facts to your attention , sir .
are you questioning my orders , major ?
general ripper , if i shut down the communi- cations center , there 'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with air command head- quarters or anyone , for that matter .
as soon as you 've done that , shut down the communications center . lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details .
no , sir . plan-r to be radioed to the wing .
are you hard of hearing , major ?
plan-r ? ? ? ?
i hope not . now , as soon as you do what i told you , have plan-r radioed to the wing .
no , sir .
are you trying to be insubordinate ?
to you , sir . but how do i know ?
who do you think you 're talking to ?
yes , sir . i just thought of something , sir . how do i know i 'm talking to you now ?
no calls at all . with or without my say-so . my voice can be imitated too , major .
i understand , sir . nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so .
no calls from inside out . no calls from outside in are even answered . no calls .
you 're right , sir .
we do n't want to be vulnerable to saboteurs calling up and pretending to be different people from the president down , do we ?
that 's right , sir .
let me worry about that , major . i 've still got my red line to the air command .
yes , sir .
major , that 's all i 've been told . just got it on the red phone . the base is to be sealed tight . and i mean tight .
but ... what kind of a shooting war ? have they hit any of our cities yet ?
yes , major . this looks like it 's going to be it .
a shooting war !
you 're a good officer , major mandrake . you have a right to know . it looks like we 're in a shooting war !
yes , sir . what 's up , general ripper ?
that 's right . i want this flashed to all section immediately .
condition red !
all right , major . i 'm putting the base on condition red .
yes , sir .
good . has the wing confirmed holding at x-points ?
no , sir .
youddo n't think i 'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important , do you , major ?
i do n't know , sir . we just spoke a few minutes ago .
why do you think i ask ?
certainly , general . why do you ask , sir ?
do you recognize my voice ?
yes , sir .
this is general ripper speaking .
combat operations center , major mandrake speaking .
major , i happen to believe in a life after this one , so i believe i will have to answer for what i have done . i think i can .
general , now that you 've done that , i beg you to recall the wing .
peace on earth .
to peace on earth , major .
yes , sir . why do n't you stop the fighting , sir ?
major , those are my boys out there dying .
major , i hate to say this , but i think you 've been enemy indoctrinated , and you do n't even know it .
look , sir . i 'm no expert on the subject , but i 've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have . like , say , both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors . you ca n't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it . and if i were going to try and hide a few , i would n't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob is n't going to run and blab for a million bucks . we 're as smart as they are , and if they cheat , or even hold back information , we 'd pull right out .
do you think they would cheat ?
no , sir . i 'm sure we would n't .
do you think we 'd cheat ?
general , what 's good enough for the president and all the experts he 's got working on the thing , is good enough for me .
and you 'd like to see that ?
if they gave us what we think we need , yes , i guess we would .
but if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want , we 'd agree , would n't we ?
but , general , we 're on our toes . we have n't agreed to anything for years . inffact , a a lot of people say we never will .
i 'll tell you what i do think . if they say they 're for disarmament , i say anyone who says they 're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool .
do n't you think he knows something about this , general ripper ?
do n't be offended , major . our president holds the same views .
well , i 'm not , sir . honestly , sir .
major , you 're talking like one of them !
gee , sir , that last remark does n't exactly make all the sense in the world .
no , major , i do n't . they have no regard for human life . they would n't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won .
well , for the same reasons we do , sir . do n't you see ?
i still ask , why do they want disarmament ?
well , sir , i remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99 % of the days of the year , given average luck it would fail in thirty years .
go on , major . you fascinate me .
that 's right , sir . and do n't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb . what if they start something ?
i 've heard the arguments . like napoleon 's quote , `` there 's one thing you ca n't do with a bayonet , and that 's - sit on it . ''
i was just going to say , as long as the weapons exist , sooner or later something 's going to happen -- and that 'll be it for both countries .
go on , major .
well , sir , like i said , for the same reasons we do . i mean , all the experts say the most likely way for war to start nowadays is by an accident , or a mistake , or by some mentally unbalanced person --
then do n't you realize the bomb gives us peace not war ? and , if that 's the case , i ask you again : why do they want disarmament ?
right .
but war does n't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right ?
i do n't know , sir . but they 're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are . war just does n't make sense any more , for anybody .
but we mean it because we are a peace- loving country . are they a peace-loving country , major .
yes , sir . but so do we .
you 're very naive , major . do n't they say they want disarmament ?
and i guess they wo n't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country .
not yet , major . not yet .
well , i know they 've been going on for years , and they have n't gotten any place .
where ? everywhere , major . everywhere .
where , sir ?
major mandrake , i guess you do n't follow what 's going on too closely , do you ?
but if you just let things alone , we would n't lose anyone .
you 're absolutely right . you forgot to mention their nuclear subs . but it would n't matter . sure we would n't get off without getting our hair mussed , but we 'd prevail . i do n't think we 'd lose more than fifty million people , tops .
but even then , we would n't get everything . i mean some missiles would abort , or they 'd miss their targets , or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we do n't know about .
i know so , major . i know so . and add to that , the whole air command force being committed to clobber everything they 've got .
i guess so .
our missiles would impact before my planes were even discovered by the enemy , would n't they ?
i suppose we might catch them off their guard .
you 're being dense , major . i certainly do n't
but then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people , sir ?
that 's close enough , major .
well , i think i remember reading the report on that . was n't it something like a hundred and sixty million ?
if we have n't taken any further action , they certainly will . doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack ?
but when they do , sir , wo n't they hit back with everything they 've got ?
you see , major , at this very moment , while we sit and chat , a decision is being made by the president in the war room . he knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes .
i 'm trying to , sir .
when he said it , fifty years ago , he might have been right . but today , war is too important to be left to the politicians . do you follow me , major ?
i see .
he said war was too important a matter to be left to generals .
i do n't think so , sir .
do you remember what clemenceau once said about war ?
no , sir . i mean i did n't think you had n't given it a lot of thought .
i 've given it alot of thought , major . do n't think i have n't .
well , general -- i was wondering , why are you doing this ? i mean why do you want to start the war ?
ask away , major .
general ripper , can i ask another question ?
to peace on earth .
what shall we drink to , sir ?
perfect . thank you , major . and now let 's drink a toast .
that about right ?
just a squirt .
how much soda , sir .
you 're damned right they are .
i suppose they are , sir .
we 've come a long way since world war ii , major . and the lessons we 've learned are all in plan-r .
i know that , sir .
do n't fret about it , major . there 's nothing anyone can do about it now . i 'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the crm-114 .
perhaps , major . perhaps . pour me a scotch and soda , please . and help yourself to whatever you like .
but -- why ... that would be an awful thing to do , sir .
suppose that were the case ?
because i thought it proper , major . why else would you think i 'd do it ?
but then , sir , why have you issued the order : wing attack , plan-r ?
and if that were true ?
well , i was thinking , maybe an enemy attack is not in progress ?
that 's a good question , major . maybe if you think hard , you can think of the answer yourself .
well , sir , i was thinking , if an enemy attack is in progress , how come the radio 's still playing music ? it 's supposed to go off , and all we should hear are civil defense broadcasts .
you know the regulations well , major .
and a condition red means enemy attack in progress , does n't it ?
that is correct , major .
well , general ripper , sir -- i was thinking -- we 're on a condition red , are n't we ?
certainly , major mandrake . you 're a good officer , and you can ask me a question any time you want to .
yes , sir . general , can i ask a question ?
i did n't mean for anyone to play anyone else 's radio either , major .
oh , it 's not my radio , sir . i picked it up in the communications center .
i see you 're playing your radio , major . is n't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base ?
that 's right , major .
sort of like a new hobby , huh , general ?
please do n't take any notice of this weapon , major . i love all weapons , and as of late , i 've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times .
what 's the gun for , general ripper ?
zlat , make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices .
you 've lied to me twice - i 'm sorry , but it will be strictly routine . these men are experts .
well , sir , if the a/c 's a really good man , i mean really sharp , why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time . a real big plane , like a sting ray , zig-zagging in , its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard -- - has he a chance ? ... ..hell , yes ! he has one hell of a chance .
general , stick to the point , please .
if i can speak freely , sir -- look , these guys talk big , but frankly , we think they 're short of know-how . you ca n't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys , and i do n't mean that as an insult , mister ambassador . hell , we all know what kind of guts your people have . why just look how many millions of 'em those nazis killed and , hell , they still would n't quit .
is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy air defense , when its course and target are known ?
well , the premier doped it out pretty well . its primary is their missile base at laputa .
what 's the target .
yes , sir . we 're still sending it . but it 's a funny thing we do n't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all .
have you tried the recall again ?
well , sir , it looks like one aircraft , the `` leper colony '' , failed to receive the recall .
yes ?
well , just common sense , sir . thirty from thirty-four equals four , or my name 's not `` buck '' schmuck !
how do you know they were shot down , buck ?
hello , are you still there ? ... uh-huh ... i 'll be right back . we 're still working this thing out .
mister president , there were thirty-four aircraft involved . thirty acknowledged the recall . that makes four shot down .
look , he 's there , and you 're here .
well , if you choose to take his word over mine -- -
he says they 've only shot down three planes .
naturally i am , sir .
general schmuck , are you positive of your figures ?
general faceman , what was the name of the officer who called me from burpelson ?
i 'm not certain , mister president . but i believe it was four .
how many planes did we lose ?
i believe it will be just a few minutes , at the most .
i 'm not certain , mister president . the boys in concom do the pencil work .
how long will it take to receive them all ?
they 're coming in now .
have you received acknowledgements from every plane ?
knock it off will you , general ? crudley , find out what 's holding up that call !
we do n't operate like you kgb boys .
that 's the idea , general schmuck . zlat !
but he 'll hear everything we 're saying . and if he just looks out of that window , he 'll see everything we 're doing .
admiral buldike ?
i do n't think that 's a fair analogy , sir .
but we ca n't communicate with the base .
i want to talk to general ripper .
general jack d. ripper , sir .
i should say practically none , though we have our communications center plowing through every possible three-letter combination . the trouble is that there are about seventeen thousand permutations , and it will take us approximately four and a half days to go through them all .
then there 's no chance for recall ?
mister president , i know you think i 've let you down , but we had to have a plan-r. if we completely centralized the command and control , all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the capitol , and we 'd be out of business . we 'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered .
how could you let this happen , general schmuck ?
we estimate the planes should be entering their coastal radar cover in about twenty-five min- utes .
how soon until the enemy finds out what 's going on ?
mister president , to guard against espionage , the three letter of the code group for plan-r are always selected by the lower echelon commander himself , just before each mission . they are sealed in the various attack plans and are known only to the lower echelon commander and his deputy . in this case the deputy is air-borne with the wing , and general ripper refuses to recall the planes .
and i suppose you 're going to tell me you do n't know what the three-letter code is .
once the orders have been given , plan-r requires any new orders to be received on the crm-114 in the aircraft . but the crm-114 will not receive any transmissions unless they are preceded by the proper three-letter code group .
why ca n't you cancel it ?
well , sir , plan-r is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack .
what the hell is plan-r ?
yes , sir . the base commander , general ripper , selected plan-r ?
and i suppose there 's some reason why you have n't recalled them ?
that 's right , sir . but the planes were at their positive control points , ready to turn around when general ripper issued the final go-code .
well , what about the positive control , the safety catch ? do n't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order ?
i 'm afraid so , mister presient . being part of the air-borne alert , each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece .
i presume the planes are armed ?
it was a honest mistake , sir .
ca n't help it . what 's the wind like ?
you know what that 'll do to our fuel consumption .
give me revs for maximum speed at sea level .
all right ... we 're still flying . i 'm taking her down to the deck .
i do n't think so .
thanks , binky . can you see bromdingna island yet ?
we should be crossing the coast in about six minutes .
lothar , take your checks now .
roger , maintain .
roger . one-three-eight .
i 've got the heading , major . one-three-eight .
roughly , one-zero-five . i 'll have it plotted in a minute , major kong .
give me a first rough course as soon as you can , lieutenant ballmuff .
no , they would n't send us in with bombs on an exercise .
yeah , to see if we 're on our toes .
fifteen ! twelve o ' clock .
maximum ecm .
the dirty , stinking , rotten , sons of b 's ! ! they might have clobbered marge and the
he 's right . they must have clobbered some of our cities already .
they must have clobbered some of our cities already !
he 's right . we would n't have started it .
maybe it 's an exercise .
what else could it be ?
sure , i 'll take her up right now .
could you take her up right now , king ? other- wise we 'll get kind of close to the fireball .
sure , i 'll take her up to eight hundred .
well , listen , king . could you take her up to about eight hundred ? that 'll help you come in at a nice down-angle , and it 'll give us a chance for our chutes to open .
hey , terry , i 'm hit .
sorry , king . my leg 's stiff as a board .
hang on , boys .
i think they mean business .
if they come down low enough to make a firing pass , they 'll never be able to pull up in time .
they 're moving apart .
they ca n't touch us at this height .
must be mach two-five stuff . altitude fifteen thousand .
they must have made a visual contact .
fighters closing fast - range fifty miles .
roger .
look , ca n't someone help me ?
lieutenant quiffer , we 're all sorry you were hit , and we 'll help you stick it together as soon as we get squared away .
look , i 'm shot - it hurts .
come on , quentin , is n't that pretty selfish , putting yourself ahead of the mission ?
why ca n't he help me now ? he 's sitting two feet away from me !
lieutenant toejam , why do n't you help him ?
yeah , i got it in the thigh .
we 'll worry about that later . okay , i 'll take damage reports .
should n't be bad . might even help . but my guess is we 're going to have to paddle our way back .
maximum ecm !
twenty ! twelve o ' clock .
thirty-five , still straight .
call them every five miles .
between mach 3 and 4 .
speed ?
forty-five . still coming straight and fast . twelve o ' clock .
they must have been fired from bromdingna - probably one of their new vampire - 202 's . they 've got a range well over a hundred miles .
just the missiles .
roger , keep calling them . knock off auto-pilot , ace .
missiles ! sixty miles off , heading in fast . steady track , they look like beam riders .
zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary .
check .
missile and plane flight path computer showing four greens .
check .
main interference linked to electronic detector . fight interference on readi- ness state .
a through h is correct .
forget it , quentin . it can happen to the best of us . now let 's get squared away .
i 'm sorry , major kong . i guess i was way out of line .
war ?
war .
what ?
then this is it .
skip it and jump , damn you ! this flak 's so close , i can smell it .
listen , king , old buddy . on behalf -- -
forget it .
gee , we hate to leave you like this , major kong . but there is n't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around .
very interesting .
yep , it 's the crm-114 code , all right .
let 's see ... international morse , i think ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... r ... e ... c ... a ... l ... l ... m ... i ... s ... t ... a ... k ... e ... o ... p ... e ... gee , i do n't know , it seems to be some kind of code .
no kidding .
some kind of signaling .
what does it look like ?
damn you , lieutenant toejam ! lothar !
where 'd they get you ?
listen , i think i 'm hit bad .
so am i .
lieutenant toejam 's going to help you in a minute . can you check your ecm ?
i thought i should check out the damage first . my gear is busted up pretty bad .
primary arming switch .
primary arming switch .
ready , major .
lieutenant toejam , are you ready for bim and bam ?
primary target the icbm base at laputa . one weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand . second weapon to be used if first malfunctions . otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of karnak . fused air burst at ten thousand .
roger , i 'm setting up the crm-114 .
okay . check these points . complete radio silence . to ensure that the enemy ca n't plant false transmissions and fake orders , the crm-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits . the three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the crm-114 , which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters . you got it ?
yeah , it sure looks like the real thing , all right .
no , this looks like the real thing .
that 's what i 'm doing , and it comes out the same .
check your code again . no one at base would pull a stunt like that , terry .
wing attack , plan-r. that 's exactly what it says .
i just got another blast on the crm-114 , and the damned thing decodes : wing attack , plan-r .
yeah ?
hey , king . somebody at burpelson has a very perverted sense of humor .
well , i just wanted you to know how i felt . hell , i know air command would n't have taken you if you were n't okay . and do n't think i do n't know some of our best ball-players and entertainers are of negro descent .
sure , king .
i just wanted you to know i did n't mean anything by it .
forget it .
listen , lothar . you know that crack i made about your ... butt ?
thanks , king . i 've always wanted to take one of these big babies in .
i 'd be mighty proud if you did , lothar .
king , would you mind if i keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in ?
i thought maybe you 'd like some company .
now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for , lothar ?
i thought i 'd go along for the ride .
what the hell are you doing here , lothar ?
we 're on course , major . just fixed our position on that river back there .
roger .
well , it would probably help if you took it ... sort of ... straight down .
would it matter if they hit at a flat angle ? i mean , do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger ?
i think it 's okay , king . they should go off on impact .
there 's no other way , boys . i 'm going to have to take her in ... the hard way .
let me check .
there 's no other way , lothar . can you re-arm the bombs for impact ?
but how are we going to drop the bombs if the doors wo n't -- - hey , king ... .you 're not thinking of -- - you do n't mean you 'd -- - ? ? ?
i asked you a question , lothar !
but i told you , i do n't think we can get the bomb bay doors open .
lothar , can you arm the bombs for impact ?
i tried everything . something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took .
have you tried the emergency system ?
but i get a red light .
maybe the warning system 's out .
well , i ca n't get out and look , king . but i do n't get a green light .
are you sure ?
well , i hate to say this , but i think the bomb bay doors are stuck .
i 'm okay . what 's up ?
it 's me - lothar . are you okay ?
who 's that ?
forget it . okay , team , let 's break it up and get ready for the kick-off .
sorry , king .
first lesson in war college : never under- estimate your enemy .
you 're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball .
we crossed the coast over an hour ago . okay ?
okay , how do we know they did n't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew ? how do we know that ?
come on , king . that does n't make sense .
nobody 's loyalty is beyond question . besides , how do we know one of his staff did n't see it ?
but the code is made up by general ripper , and he 's the only one left at the base who would know the code .
there are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose .
then get off my back !
take it easy , major kong .
lieutentant zogg , how would you like your black butt slung into a general court martial when we get back ? ? ?
look , king , maybe you 've lost too much blood , or something .
i said that 's the point !
i do n't get you , king .
that 's the point .
right . so how could we get any messages ?
the crm-114 is smashed , right ?
like hell it does .
then that settles it , does n't it ?
but the crm-114 has been smashed for almost an hour .
our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders . and therefore , to disregard anything that does n't come on the crm-114 .
look , this is different .
lieutenant zogg , what do our orders say about the authentication of orders during an attack mission ?
how the hell do i know ? maybe the war 's over .
why should they call us back ?
they must have gotten it from the base . no one else would know it .
you tell me .
wait a minute , major . `` ope , '' that 's the recall code . where would they get that ?
well , we sure as hell are n't going home just because the enemy tells us to .
what do you mean ?
what are you talking about ?
i mean pulling a stunt like that .
what do you mean ?
you sure have to hand it to those guys .
no , i think it means , `` recall period mistake , '' and the ope is probably the crm-114 code . terry ?
recall what mistake ?
no , look ! it 's `` ope - recall mistake . ''
quentin , how 's your gear ?
i do n't know what we got left besides bim and bam .
listen , give me a shot quick !
he 's dead , all right .
hell , he looks dead .
how do you know he 's dead ?
in the back ... feels like an arrowhead .
where 'd they get you ?
sure ! sure , i 'm on my way .
i bit his jugular vein . now will you shut up and get up here ? ? ?
what happened ?
he 's dead .
ca n't `` ace '' help you ?
lothar , get up here fast , and bring your first- aid kit ! i 'm hit kinda bad , i think .
yes , major .
binky ?
everything still checks out okay .
let 's have a rundown on the damage , lothar ?
master safety on .
all right , lothat , that does it . master safety on now until bomb run .
primary bomb is live .
master kong .
master safety .
check , ten thousand air burst .
fusing for ten thousand air burst .
seond safety .
second safety .
first safety .
release first safety .
primary trigger switch .
primary circuit is live .
as soon as i 've checked over the route . about five minutes . all right ?
when do you want to arm the bomb for the primary , major ?
check , all bomb circuits green . okay , lothar .
bomb doors circuit is green , bomb release circuit is green , bomb fusing circuit is green .
check target approach .
hellnno , major . i was just trying to think the thing through .
are you saying our order do n't make sense ?
well , if they hit us first , they 've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already . we 'll just be hitting empty real estate .
what 's your point , lothar ?
well , if there 's a war , they must have hit us first .
that 's what i said .
our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities , right ?
shoot , lothar .
i 've got one .
in about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar . cross in over the coast low-level , continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary , and climb for bomb run . any questions ?
certainly not , sir . when they go down into the mine , everyone else will still be alive . they will have no shocking memories , and the prevailing emotion should be one of a nostalgia for those
but , look here , von klutz . wo n't this nucleus of survivors be so shocked , grief-stricken , and anguished that they will envy the dead , and indeed , not wish to go on living ?
when they emerge , a good deal of present real estate and machine tools will still be recoverable , if they are moth-balled in advance . i would guess they could then work their way back to our present gross national product within twenty years .
a special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed , but off-hand , i should say that in addition to the factors of youth , health , sexual fertility , intelligence , and a cross-section of necessary skills , it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included , to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition .
but who would be chosen ?
it would not be difficult . nuclear reactors could provide power almost indefinitely . greenhouses could maintain plant life . animals could be bred and slaughtered . a quick survey would have to be made of all the suitable minesites in the country , but i should n't be surprised if several hundred thousand of our people could be accomodatedd . every nation would undoubtedly follow suit .
mister president , man is an amazingly adaptable creature . after all , the conditions would be far superior to those , say , of the nazi concentration camps , where there is ample evidence most of the wretched creatures clung desperately to life .
but they could n't come out for a hundred years !
in a matter of weeks , sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided .
yes . the radioactivity could not penetrate a mine some thousands of feet deep .
at the bottom of mines ?
you know , like , like , i would always think , uh , you know , what if i make the wrong move ? but maybe there is n't any right move . you know ? i mean , look at us . you know , we all dress the same , we all talk the same , we all fuck the same , we all watch the same tv . nobody 's really different , even if they think they 're different . `` oh , boy , look at my tattoo , you know ? '' and see , that 's what makes me freak . because i can do anything i want , as long as i do n't care about the result .
mm-hm .
you know ? and it used to scare me so much that i did n't know what was coming in my life .
yeah , i guess .
yeah , but , when i was walking , i realized that he 's stuck in that limo all the time . he 's stuck with his interviews , he 's stuck with his autograph , he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do , you know ? he 's not free . he 's just part of the machine , and if you think about it , freedom 's all that there really is .
well , sure , he 's rich and he 's famous . he 's got everything and you 've got nothing .
well , what it was ... i , i do n't want to admit it , but , you know , i was jealous of pony .
yeah .
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing . we were getting off on the fact that we 're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest . and i got out and i just started walking .
it was like hell with windows . you know , there 's shit on the walls . kids my age sucking their thumbs . i mean , every day i would , i 'd wake up in my cell and i 'd think , my parents put me here . why ? why ? because i stayed out all night one time . uh , because i broke the vcr when i was drunk . because i was out of control . i thought my parents loved me .
it was pretty bad , huh ?
yeah , it would suck big time . i 'd kill myself first .
i mean , that would suck if you had to go back to rehab .
no . oh , maybe . fuck .
well , you should n't drink . are you gon na drink ?
uh , ninety days . and now i just have to go once a week . see , i 'm rehabilitated .
how long were you in there ?
intense .
oh , yeah , you had to go to highgate . that must 've been intense .
rehab . outpatient . i have to go once a week . it 's kind of like aa .
in group ?
sure , all the time , in group .
did you ever hear that saying , `` this too shall pass '' ?
yeah .
you know , one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense .
knock yourself out .
can i have some ?
i do n't anymore .
i just walked all the way from westside to here . i have n't walked that far since junior high . i thought you did n't drink .
wait . racism ? you do n't know anybody who 's black !
um-hm .
`` burger manifesto , part one '' is gon na make people think ?
mn-hm .
alright . she told him to meet us here . fuck .
we are ?
i do n't know .
uh , well , what 'd she say ? is pony coming ?
uh , yeah , she should be coming by .
you did n't get me in trouble .
yeah , i talked to your mom . i think i woke her up . i hope i did n't get you in trouble .
uh , home , you know .
tim , he listens to you . do you think it 's a good idea ? seriously ?
typical male .
typical male .
typical male .
yes .
responsibility , progress .
i stand for something . and i 'm trying to communicate something .
uh-huh .
why is everything about you , jeff ?
it 's called `` burger manifesto , part one the dialectical expression of testosterone . '' is n't that a great title ?
behind me . i 'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff .
slides go with it .
what did you guys think ?
yeah !
was it okay ?
that was really great .
okay , whatever you want .
i do n't smoke dubes and i do n't really hang out . but i 'll go back . okay .
yeah , we could hang out and smoke a dube , you know ?
now ?
do you wan na go to the van ?
i do n't know . waiting , i guess . you know ?
yeah .
right now ?
mm . hey , what are you doing now ?
oh , no , it 's not . i mean , they 're not all totally in a coma . i mean , they know when i 'm helping them .
sounds like a bummer .
oh , some of 'em . but it 's mostly just strokes and shit . i mean , most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow . usually they die id they 're , you know , really yellow .
any gunshot victims ?
no , i , you know , i help 'em out . i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch . that kind of thing .
your a nurse ?
yeah , i 'm a nurse 's aide at mercy .

so , we 're all old friends of pony 's . we go way back to our childhood .
so , do you guys want to do something , go someplace or something like that ?
okay .
a long , long , long ...
okay , okay .
a long , long , long , long , while .
watch out for that tree .
yeah , a long while . a long , long while .
i 'm saying no , i 'm saying after a while it 'd wear thin .
ah !
no , i 'm not saying that i would n't love it .
oh , come on , man . tell me you would n't love it !
that sounds so depressing .
same , more of the same . yep , just keep doing the same thing all the time , around and around the clock . with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy . then , instead of watching gilligan , we 'd watch captain kirk .
that sounds so great , man . yes . yes . hey , what would you do in the afternoon ?
i would n't . if i were in his shoes , every morning i 'd get up singing , man . do my work-out , take a shower , followed by a hearty breakfast , steak and eggs , washed down with a pot of hot coffee , six pack of coors lite . then i 'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe , who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit . so i 'd , like , have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude . except she 'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em . and then she 'd take out this half-ounce of blow , we 'd snap out a few mondo lines , vaporize a few million brain cells , screw for about an hour , then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan .
i 'd get bored .
oh , yeah , yeah . wait , um , how do you figure that ?
you know what ? he probably gets bored with all that shit .
oh , right . oh , oh my god ! pony , it 's so huge !
no , he 's not with a girl .
you wan na bet he 's with a girl ?
jesus christ .
sorry .
buff , buff , buff , buff , buff .
oh , i 'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video . oh , oh , pony , come on , give it to me ! stud ! oh !
no , no .
that 's the rock star thing .
no , i seriously doubt that pony 's gon na be in a limo .
the dude wants it .
do n't let 'em fight .
yes !
i do n't know . later . i do n't know .
yeah , no , it was n't even my idea .
pony 's coming here to the corner ? !
he 's around and , you know , maybe he 's coming by . sooze told him to come by and hang out , whatever . it 's no big deal . me , him , and sooze are gon na ...
but , so , pony 's comin ' by here to the corner ?

hey , it 's me . no , that 's , that 's the ultimate liar of liars .
oh , untrue , jeffster . i think , uh , two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls .
your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie .
you should get upset . everyone should get upset . when , when hitler was greasing the jews , people were saying , `` do n't get me upset . your bumming me out . '' my duty as a human being is to be pissed off . jesus christ , not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place . nothing ever changes , man . fifty years from now we 're all gon na be dead and there 'll be new people standing here drinking beer , eating pizza , bitching and moaning about the price of oreos , and they wo n't even know we were ever here . and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there 'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they 're doing on this fucking planet and they 'll all be full of shit . it 's all so fucking futile .
yo , your gettin ' me all upset here .
buff , that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi .
oh yeah ? oh , how 'd you ship it over there , man ? federal express ? hm ? by the time it got there it 'd be way cold and coagulated . total waste . cheese be stuck to the cardboard .
needs some pizza in his diet .
guy should cut down on his caffeine intake .

no , i do n't .
you do .
no , i do n't .
yes , you do .
no , i do n't .
jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing .
yeah , but that does n't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down .
mm .
yeah , uh , that would depend , but yeah . she should .
i do n't know .
so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler ? what are we doing , jeff ? you and me ?
no , no .
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist ?
mm-mm .
why should i stay here , jeff ? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change , while you bitch about burnfield ?
so , what , why ca n't you do that here ? what 's wrong with here ? why is somewhere else better ?
my goal is to make art .
okay , look . my job is not who i am . i do n't need that . why ? what 's your goal ? status ? money ? getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine ?
taking one community college course on the history of nicaragua , while barely holding a job packing boxes ?
mm-hm .
new ground ?
okay , well , then , i 'm gon na break new ground .
no one does nothing , jeff .
nothing .
so what do you wan na do ?
no , no , see , that 's not what i 'm saying . i could go to new york if i wanted to , but what 's the point ? so i can learn how to order a cappuccino ? so i can get mugged by some crackhead ? so i can see , see homeless people up close and personal ?
come with me .
and ?
of course .
us .
what feelings ?
did it ever occur to you that i might have some feelings about you moving to new york ?
what ?
sooze .
jeff . you know , i was talking to mister brooks yesterday . he has this friend in new york who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month . i could swing that . six-fifty .
... like fucking robots . look at those kids there .
jeff . jeff .
i do n't know . i would 've done something . this is kind of hypothetical , is n't it ? this place is so stupid . i ca n't believe we 're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism . with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh ...
how ?
i would 've stopped it .
okay , what would you have done .
yeah .
oh , yeah ?
okay , but nothing happened . believe me , if i thought something really bad was going to happen , i would 've done something .
it got that close .
it was just something that got out of hand . did anyone get hurt ?
it was a racial incident .
tim !
this is ridiculous !
okay . well , you know , he 's always been a nice guy and i like him .
like i 'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start .
um , because you did n't want to go .
well , if you love him so much , why did n't you go see him play ?
i ca n't wait till pony gets here , you know ? have a conversation with a human being ?
typical male .
can i talk ?
you know , all you know is what 's good for you .
can i talk here ? let me talk .
oh , yeah , right . yeah , right . fuck you .
i stand for honesty ! i stand for some level of truth !
what ? what do you stand for ?
yes , i stand for -
but do you stand for anything ?
no , no , no . i 'm not being cynical , i 'm being honest .
no , sweetie . cynicism is bullshit .
no , idealism is guilty , middle class bullshit .
i 'm talking about idealism .
hey !
your completely missing the point .
one !
god , karen johnson .
name one .
of course i do !
sexual politics , racism , the environment , the military industrial ...
like what ?
about things that are important to me .
about what ?
yes , you asshole .
i 'm trying to communicate how i feel , jeff . you know raise consciousness . make people think for a change .
no , no . it 's an honest question . what are you trying to communicate ?
so you can give me more shit ?
what are you trying to communicate ? tell us .
well , fuck ! might as well not do anything ! let 's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl .
oh , well , then you better listen to him .
mister brooks has had shows in new york , jeff . he 's been reviewed in art forum . i think he knows .
no , no , no . y-you know what ? y-your packing your bags , you 're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age , so he tells you you have talent .
i do n't want to hear it anymore .
`` the worst i can do is starve to death . '' listen to you .
i 'm not doing it anywhere , jeff . it 's just part of my application to the school of visual arts in new york .
your sure as hell right about that .
it 's a piece .
yeah , man , male , significant other , whatever the fuck i am .
man ?
no , not , not everything . this . i am the man in your life .

was that supposed to be me ?
okay , so maybe later .

oh , no , man , look . look , you know , it 's me , okay ? i come out here and i 'm , so used to everyone , you know , kissing my ass and i think i 'm a fucking star , man , and i 'm really sorry if i 'm full of attitude . i , i really ...
no , man . hey . no , you know what ? hey , it 's you , man . it 's , you know what , you know what it is ? it 's this tarpit of stupidity that we 're all stuck in . it 's this cell . it 's this void , you know .
you know what i 'm saying ?
w-wait a minute , wait a minute .
of course it does .
well , i , i did n't say i was special , but it 's one thing , you know , and it 's another thing to actually communicate it to people . you know what i mean ? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it , does that make a sound ?
comment , say things , think . whatever . why are you so special ?
what ?
yeah , well , that 's what i do too .
i do n't know . uh , i 'm an artist , i guess . you know , there 's life and then there 's the people watching the life , commenting on it .
well , if we 're , like , the man invisible , what are you ?
what do you mean ?
so who are you ?
no , no , they , uh , you know , that can be kind of a hassle , so , uh , you know , i just stay at the four seasons . it 's easier .
so , um , pony , where are you staying ? are you staying at your mother 's house ?
well , i mean , we jammed a couple of times . you know , i mean , you play harmonica , but that was before we were really a band , you know , before danny signed us .

kansas is right . we 're like sisters -- we 're closer than sisters . and you do n't turn your back on family .
cleo !
i 'm in , too .
you just became a statistic !
holy shit .
bye .
thanks , cleo . see you tomorrow .
di ? i just called to say that conan talked about us again last night .
hello ?
i personally think of how conan started as a writer , then became a ...
my fault - what do we do that enables us to be as great as we are ?
use the bathroom , because the port-a potties on the field are gross .
hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out . heee hee-haaa ... .
is jack upset that he ca n't be here ?
it 's off ... i ca n't take the fighting , the back-stabbing , the open hostility . we 're not acting like cheerleaders , we 're acting like a bunch of sorority girls !
di , we 're sorry . we ...
well ... uh ... they , y'know , uh ... they had nicknames .
cleo , i 've already thrown up twice today - could you please get to any relevant part of the movie ?
... he slices off the guy 's ear , and i mean you see everything - the bloody pink hole where the --
everything 's fine . i 'm just having a little trouble keeping my frown upside down .
di , are you okay ? we can skip the girl party this week .
wayne gretzky .
another sex dream ?
i 've got to get that . relax . i 'll see you tomorrow .
what ? ! that 's insane ! ! ! why would i go to the police ?
she thinks you went to the police .
di , it 's luce . kansas just called and said she 's going to `` fuck me up ! '' then i heard coughing , a thud and kansas had to go . i think her grandma had another heart attack . anyway , why does she want to `` fuck me up ? ''
that 's right . practice makes perfect . i 'm practicing to have a baby right now . if we do a practice job , we 'll not only get the experience , but also the extra money we need for guns !
-- we practice ! sorry , cleo .
hee-hee-hee , haaaaa-that 's it ? hee-hee hee ...
okay , even with all our savings , it 's still only six hundred fifty-four .
of course - of course ! hands in ...
but , we have to make a smart plan !
well ...
so then this is n't crazy . it 's a sure bet .
... i do n't know . probably not .
if you do n't - can you still afford to go to harvard ?
no .
that 's right . so all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes .
and they get caught !
c'mon , luce , people do it in the movies all the time .
look , i might be moody . i might be gassy . but i am perfectly sane . think about it . in school , they tell us , `` dreams can come true . '' right ?
oh my g-d , i read about this ! it 's called a `` pregnancy insanity . '' quick , she needs a sitz bath --
`` positive '' you 're sure i 'm not fat or `` positive '' i 'm ...
positive .
you sure ?
oh g-d , i 'm sorry ... you 're not really fat ! i was just saying that because , uh , i thought that 's what you wanted me to say .
no i do n't ... i keep asking because i feel fat .
look , you 're fat , diane . you 're fat , fat , fat ! because you eat , eat , eat ! what ? ! she keeps asking because she wants some honesty .
no ... i 've been pregnant .
oh my g-d , you 've been robbed !
huh-ha-wha ? ahh ! i 'm under the ice ! i 'm uh -- oh ... man ... that was a weird one .
diane ? diane !
jus some girlie things for the squad .
oh ... what are you working on ?
that was gas , sweetie .
... so although their dad said , `` do n't get out of the car until i get back with help , '' they knew the sheriff 's voice as he yelled . `` run to my voice - and do n't look back . '' the twins did as he said , but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient , bouncing their father 's head on the top of the car ! ah ! they jumped , diane ! they jumped !
diane , there 's no excuse for not taking your pre-natal vitamins . now , if you guys were really friends , you 'd remind her to take these .
uh , jack - look , i can explain ...
huh ? oh jesus ...
if you reach for the stars , you 're bound to get -- mm-jack , pull over .
mmm-hmmm ...
i never knew you dreamed of working in a grocery store bank branch . baby , we are living the great american dream !
ah ! i almost forgot gas for the baby machine . i 'll grab your snickers and get a place in line .
i know , but that was before .
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine ...
jack , i think i should get a job .
me too ! will it ever end ? ! i love this lady !
trix ...
if you could be count chocula , frankenberry or trix the rabbit , who 'd you be ?
jack ...
like cocoa puffs . good . captain crunch . bad . shreds the roof of your mouth . i mean you hear , `` tricks are for kids ! '' and you think , `` i 'm a kid , i guess they 're for me . '' but your baby brain 's got no idea that fruit loops are , like , a million times better . i 'm going to save our kid all that pain .
but di , all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby .
jack , sweetie , i 'm only eating for two .
oh , jack ...
diane , i 've loved you ever since i first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head .
i sure do .
y'think ?
so , while we 're knee deep in right now - and things seem pretty `` stinky '' - in the long run , we 're going to grow strong from this .
yeah .
i see a flower . and y'know , even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt .
spit from your dad ?
well , if i had to guess ... i 'd say that was the sound of a mother saying good-bye to her little boy and hello to a young man who 's going to be a daddy of his own ... jack , do you know what i see here ?
i do n't know ... and what the hell was that sound she made right before she hit the coffee table .
... so when your dad said , `` i never want to see your `` f-'in ' faces again ! '' do you think he meant forever or just until your mom wakes up ?
excuse me , vendela , have you seen diane ? we 're supposed to go to the homecoming dance tonight .
hi , jack .
sorry . my hands are tied .
... do not accept charity . we are two young , able-bodied americans . we do not want a handout . we want a hand-up . give us food and we will be hungry tomorrow . give us corn - the kind you plant , not eat - and we 'll grow our own food and ... and , uh , then cut it , and - uh , y'know eat it ! now , if you 're interested in giving us a home loan , i will sit back down . if not , have a nice day , ma'am .
uh , yes . yes you did .
no . wait ! did i say promise ! cross-my heart and hope-to-die , stick-a-needle-in my-eye we 'll never miss a payment ? !
let me explain something ...
what ? ! but all our paperwork 's there . my school records , jack 's football records ...
i 'm sorry .
for a pack of cigs ? i use her food stamps .
do n't use big bills !
just call me later . i got ta get some smokes for grandma .
yeah , hold on .
that you ?
she 's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning .
remember , kansas , every time you point a finger you 've got three more pointing back at you .
it was lucy ! lucy went to the cops !
he ikea 'd us .
oh no ...
hee-hee-h-wait a minute . hold on , now . what do we do before a big game ?
hey . eyes on your own belly !
we were told you could `` fix us up . ''
no ! wait ... um ... we 're the a-squad from lincoln high ? so , uh ...
oh - okay , we ai n't done with this ... those babies are gon na get a good start in life - with a real crib - one that costs a shit-load ! we 're gon na learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it - criminals ! i 'm gon na visit my mom !
oh , thank g-d ! i 'm not just super fat !
di , it 's not your fault . we all wanted to do this - for you ... for ourselves .
it 's all my fault . i 'm sorry i ever started this ...
i 'm sorry , diane , but i 'm not gon na watch my dreams fade away 'cause the virgin mary here thinks she 's gon na get ideas from kiddie movies --
kansas !
lucy , do you know for sure you 're going to get that scholarship ?
shut up .
and if the o.j . trial taught us anything , it taught us that in america , you can cut off someone 's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money . your mom only shot a guy ...
stop , you 're gon na make me cry .
listen , kansas , i know you dream of springing your mom some day ...
you sure i 'm not fat ?
uh , `` no '' ... you 're not fat .
`` no '' you 're not sure or `` no '' i 'm not fat ?
he is the great one ...
hat-trick ?
we 're here for you , diane .
madonna .
i 'll just ask the question myself ... `` is jack bartlett interested in me ? ''
nope . sounds more like the first .
well , i want to know what happened --
anyway , last time i checked , you still had to have sex to have an orgasm . and i know she ai n't seen the lord on all fours - so i 'm just saying .
wrong number nooooooo !
ooops , that 's me -- got ta run !
no . this is diane . i think you have the wrong number .
kim-lo ?
hello ?
oh thank buddha it 's you , kim-lo , i 'm being held against my will , my civil rights have been violated and it took four days to make this one phone call ...
yeah ?
fern ! c'mere ! she 's siphoning tanks - takes a sec to cap off the cyanide hose .
you 're kidding .
my daughter 's always dreamed of bein ' a cheerleader . put her on your squad and i 'll give you the guns .
oh , why did n't you say . for two-hundred i got a nice rubber band and a real sharp nail in back ... i 'll gift wrap it for you . the deal is fifteen hundred . cash . take it or leave it .
hey , hey , hey . c'mon you guys . obviously that 's a little more than our budget will allow . basically , we 're looking for something around two-hundred dollars .
right . that 'll be fifteen hundred - cash .
bullets ? no bullets ! oh my gosh , these are just to scare people . kinda like round-off , back handspring , whip back , double full . you never really use it - you just want the opposing squad to know you 've got it .
bullets .
ammo ?
okay . how much ammo you reckon you 'll need ?
well , we 'll each probably want one - so let 's make it five . five should do it .
i guess there 's an exception to every rule .
yeah ?
hold on ...
... my sunday school teacher says that in prison , women shove broom sticks up your ...
ooops , hold on a sec .
it was n't like the prison we saw - all these women had to shave their heads because they got lice from the filthy lives they 'd lived ! oh g-d , i 'm gon na be someone 's bald bitch !
hannah , we 've ...
we 're dead ! they showed this prison movie to my youth group on sunday .
hello ?
that 's okay , hannah . it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies . sex - you can learn from movies . but robberies ? there 's no way .
look , maybe i can watch a pg movie ... i 'll just say i 'm counting dirty words for sunday school .
or that ! look , you guys , i just want to provide a future for my baby . i know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand . i could open that safe in my sleep !
or , i could get my own horse ...
and hannah , you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids sally struthers advertises .
do n't martha-fucking-stewart me ! if you do n't like it - you try being a pregnant teen !
you want us to help you pick up ?
i know , hannah . look , i 'm not going to get an abortion . i mean , i always planned to get married and have kids - i 'm just going a little out of order . kinda reminds me of another young lady who found herself `` with child , '' unmarried , on a long road , with no place to sleep . 'course , that was a long-long time ago . but no matter what , she held her head high and said ... `` pappa do n't preach , i 'm in trouble deep . pappa do n't preach , 'cause i 'm keepin ' my baby . hey . i 'm gon na keep my baby . '' the great one ...
i-i did n't mean to say `` whore , '' diane . i just hear it so much at church - it kinda came flying out of my head .
i-i 'm sorry - can someone else please run the ouija board ? it 's creepy , it 's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior , jesus christ .
... ja-ck b-ar-t-le-tt ... is jack bartlett interested in me ?
you damn well better ...
i 'll get them before `` touched by an angel , '' do n't worry .
then i 'll throw a few more treats on the plate . where 's my smokes ?
uh ... yeah , grandma . she does n't mean that . kinda lost the old filter with her last stroke .
you got that big retarded girl down there ?
thanks ! that 'd be great .
oh well , then i 'll put some cookies at the top of the stairs for you gals .
oh yeah , you caught us ...
are you girls talking about boys ? practicing kissing your hands ?
shit ! yeah , grandma . me and the squad .
is that you down there ?
kansas ?
screw lucy !
maybe we can make a deal .
oh please , we 've all got bright futures ahead of us - we 're not going to tell anyone . promise !
that 's itchy , alright . how many y'need ?
definitely old .
she did , did she ? how is the old girl ?
yeah . `` itchy '' sent us .
really ...
all of you !
bank branch !
bank branch !
all of you !
hey , i even took my parents ' foster kid money . phillipe 's gon na have to gather rice without pants this month .
do n't make me jerry lewis you guys for the rest .
'cause i will jerry springer you faster than you can say `` fat-assed lesbian ! ''
uh ... maybe ?
you sure you wan na go there ?
am i the only one who cares about this ? at least i watched `` dog day afternoon ! ''
i 'm only allowed `` g '' movies .
wait a minute . you watched the apple fucking-dumpling gang ? !
... so , while it 's a laugh riot for the whole family , and tim conway is just about as funny as they come , especially when he goes ...
but you 're not married .
oh my g-d ! i 'm not first !
hold up , hold up . any sentence that starts with `` at church camp '' ai n't leading to the big `` o . ''
yeah . this summer at church camp ? i 'm pretty sure i had , y'know , an orgasm .
well technically , i do n't think i 'm a virgin anymore .
hannah , in order to get real answers from the netherworld , you 've got ta have a christian virgin run the board . your kind is pure of heart - the devil wo n't dick with you .
wait , petunia . mommy 's a little amped up - did n't get her yard time this morning . mink ai n't my bitch . she 's a specialist ... in banks .
hey , do n't `` mouthy shit '' me - i 'm outta here .
what ? ! hush up , you mouthy little shit !
oh , jesus christ , mom ! like my life ai n't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you 're in here ? now i have to add , `` p.s . my mom 's a dyke '' too ?
kansas , i want you to meet someone special .
so you need my help ? oh my g-d , this is like asking me for help with your homework . hey , mink , c'mere !
i know , but we ca n't quite figure out how to , y'know , do it .
well , shit-fire , kansas , that 's the sweetest goddamn thing ever ...
i know - that 's what i said too . anyway , we want to help her get some money for the baby by robbing a bank .
before you ? whoo-hoo !
my best friend got pregnant .
gee , i 'll sit out this afternoon 's coffee talk . whaddya want ?
okay , you ca n't tell anybody .
now how the hell can i help you ?
your help .
my what ?
i do n't hate you . i need your help .
so could half the women in here . and i 'd rather go out with a nice can ... so watcha here for ? to say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me ...
they could kill you .
i know , but it keeps down the size of my can .
you should n't smoke so many of those .
thank g-d. i was starting to think i 'd killed the wrong man .
grandma and grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl . they did n't want you to break out and come kidnap me .
i want to help . i 'm part of this squad ...
what the hell do you want ?
stop it ! this is crazy !
i mean it . i 'm in . this is the closest thing to a goddamn family that i 've ever had . if one of us needs something , we all do .
virgin mary musta snuck that one in .
... and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm !
more proof god 's a guy ...
diane , it says here you 're going to have mood swings , uncontrollable gas .
action ! the scene starts .
roll 'em .
you 'll pardon me , norma ? why do n't you just sit and watch ? o.k . here we go .
we 're ready with the shot , mr. demille .
she got to be . a dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit . hold everything .
i hear she was a terror to work with .
of course you did n't . you did n't know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen , with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster .
i did n't mean to --
listen , thirty million fans have given her the brush . is n't that enough ?
i can tell her you 're all tied up in the projection room . i can give her the brush ...
it must be about that appalling script of hers . what can i say to her ? what can i say ?
i 'm terribly sorry , mr. de mille .
i hate to think where that puts me . i could be her father .
i 've got to run along . thanks any- way for your interest in my career .
the accent ! i 've got it : this guy is in the pay of a foreign government . get those studs . get those cuff-links .
someone in the formal set , no doubt , with a ten-carat kidney stone .
i 'm sorry about new year 's . would you believe me if i said i had to be with a sick friend ?
walking out on the mob . what 's the big idea ?
do n't worry . she 's just a fan for my literary output .
wait a minute . this is the woman i love . what 's going on ? who was loaded ?
i 'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage .
i 'll take it .
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch .
i mean , could you put me up for a couple of weeks ?
sure , this 'll go on all night .
listen , artie , can i stick around here for a while ?
the greatest . they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors . hey , easy on the punch bowl . budget only calls for three drinks per extra . fake the rest .
good party .
where 's the bar ?
say , you 're not really smuggling opium these days , are you ?
close , but no cigar .
judas e. priest , who did you borrow that from ? adolphe menjou ?
come on .
that was the general idea .
you 're going to stay , are n't you ?
let it ride for a while .
give me your coat .
i almost reported you to the bureau of missing persons . fans , you all know joe gillis , the well-known screen writer , opium smuggler and black dahlia suspect .
in a deep freeze .
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours ?
hi , artie .
well , what do you know ! joe gillis !
goodbye , mr. gillis .
carefull those are dirty words ! you sound like a bunch of new york critics . thank you , miss schaefer .
i just think pictures should say a little something .
name dropper .
schaefer . betty schaefer . and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me .
this is miss kramer .
i 'm sure you 'll be glad to meet mr. gillis . he wrote it .
just a rehash of something that was n't very good to begin with .
nothing for ladd ?
it 's from hunger .
what 's wrong with it ?
hello , mr. sheldrake . on that bases loaded . i covered it with a 2-page synopsis . but i would n't bother .
nobody asked you to .
joe , i ca n't look at you any more .
look , sweetie -- be practical . l 've got a good thing here . a long-term contract with no options . i like it that way . maybe it 's not very admirable . well , you and artie can be admirable .
if you love me , joe .
come on where ? back to a one-room apartment that i ca n't pay for ? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not ?
come on , joe .
all my things ? all the eighteen suits , all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts , and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains , and the cigarette cases ?
no , no ! i have n't heard any of this . i never got those telephone calls . i 've never been in this house ... get your things together . let 's get out of here .
all right . i 'll give you a few more clues .
no .
i 'm trying to tell you . this is an enormous place . eight master bedrooms . a sunken tub in every bathroom . there 's a bowling alley in the cellar . it 's lonely here , so she got herself a companion . a very simple set-up : an older woman who is well-to-do . a younger man who is not doing too well ... can you figure it out yourself ?
i did n't come here to see a house . what about norma desmond ?
her own movie theatre .
jealous . ever see so much junk ? she had the ceiling brought from portugal . look at this .
why did she call me ?
want something to drink ? there 's always champagne on ice , and plenty of caviar .
that was norma desmond on the phone ?
just look around . there 's a lot of her spread about . if you do n't remember the face , you must have heard the name of norma desmond .
whose ?
hers .
whose house is it ?
you bet .
this is where you live ?
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos ? that 's from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week , and no taxes . careful of these tiles , they 're slippery . valentino used to dance here .
come on in , betty ,
i do n't know why i 'm so scared , joe . is it something awful ?
hello , betty .
you did .
what happened ?
of course i love him . i always will . i 'm just not in love with him any more .
why not ? do n't you love artie ?
i do n't want it now .
stop crying . you 're getting married . that 's what you 've always wanted .
why do n't you ? we can finish the script by thursday .
he wants me to come on to arizona . he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there . it would kind of save us a honeymoon .
from artie . what 's wrong ?
it 's nothing . i got a telegram from artie .
betty , there 's no use running out on it . let 's face it , what- ever it is .
what is it you 've heard . come on , let 's have it .
i just do n't .
why not ?
something came up . i do n't want to talk about it .
what 's wrong with you tonight ? what is it , betty ?
was i ? i 'm sorry .
hey , what 's the matter ... betty , wake up ! why are you staring at me like that ?
that 's it -- there 's nothing like being twenty-two . now may i suggest that if we 're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ... now back to the typewriter .
twenty-two .
that 's no shampoo . it'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs , like a brand new auto- mobile . how old are you anyway ?
it must be my new shampoo .
may i say you smell real special .
if you please .
three cheers for betty schaefer ! i will now kiss that nose of yours .
not once . what 's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras ? it 's really more fun .
come clean , betty . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings ...
not at all . it taught me a little sense . i got me a job in the mail room , worked up to the stenographic . now i 'm a reader ...
saddest thing i ever heard .
should be . it cost three hundred dollars .
nice job .
third . grandma did stunt work for pearl white . i come from a picture family . naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star . so i had ten years of dramatic lessons , diction , dancing . then the studio made a test . well , they did n't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little . i went to a doctor and had it fixed . they made more tests , and they were crazy about my nose -- only they did n't like my acting .
second generation , huh ?
i was born just two blocks from this studio . right on lemon grove avenue . father was head elec- trician here till he died . mother still works in wardrobe .
what were you -- a child actress ?
look at this street . all card- board , all hollow , all phoney . all done with mirrors . i like it better than any street in the world . maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid .
that 's the trouble with you readers . you know all the plots . now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils .
it 's that old familiar story , you help a timid little soul across a crowded street . she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money .
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script .
i 'll say . this is solid gold .
oh , that . it 's from a friend of mine . a middle-aged lady , very foolish and very generous .
i 'm sorry . i do n't usually read private cigarette cases .
who 's who ?
who 's norma ?
constantly . no , in all serious- ness , it 's really good . it 's fun writing again . i 'm happy here , honest i am .
do n't you sometimes hate yourself ?
